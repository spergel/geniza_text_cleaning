        "text": "Preface\n\nThis volume of 4 Mediterranean Society explores the nature of\nmedieval religious democracy using the rich documentation left by a\ncommunity living on the crossroads of three continents and repre-\nsenting contacts the three religions had with one another. Like the\npreceding volume, Economic Foundations, this study is based on the\ndocuments of the Cairo Geniza (described in the Introduction to\nvolume I). As a rule, it refers to previous research on the history of the\nperiod concerned (950-1250) only when these documents seem to de-\nmand some qualification of its results.\n\nSeveral institutions and offices of a very specific character are treated\nhere and, because of their many-sided and varying functions, appear\nin each of the three chapters of this volume. When the reader is con-\nfronted with unfamiliar terms, such as “Gaon’ or “Nagid,” “yeshiva”\nor “muqaddam,” he is advised to make copious use of the Index. Each\npart of the book deals only with those aspects of an institution or an\noffice which are relevant to its subject.\n\nI wish to express my gratitude to the distinguished colleagues—\nfriends, and others whom I do not know personally—for their encour-\naging and illuminating reviews on volume I. A comprehensive glos-\nsary of the Arabic and Hebrew terms mentioned and explained in this\nbook (missed by some readers), as well as cumulative indexes of\nGeniza texts and general topics, will be included in volume III. As\nannounced in the Preface to volume I, a companion volume, called\nMediterranean People: Letters and Documents from the Cairo\nGeniza, Translated into English, will be published after the publica-\ntion of the third and final volume of the present work.\n\nUnlike volume I, this volume does not contain an index of Geniza\ntexts. Such an index would have comprised at least forty pages, but\nwould have been of only temporary value since the sources cited here\nare included in the final, cumulative index now in preparation for\ninclusion in volume III. Moreover, this volume is divided into more\nthan sixty sections and subsections (see Contents) so that anyone wish-\ning to make sure whether a certain source is included would be able\nto find out in a matter of minutes.\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "viii Preface\n\nAs in volume ], and for the same reason, no bibliography is at-\ntached, but the reader will find copious references to scientific litera-\nture in the lists of abbreviations and, of course, in the Notes.\n\nReaders using the Notes are advised that cross references to chapter,\nsection, and note refer also to the relevant text. It has been found that\nthis method is more expedient than references simply to pages. A page\nin this volume contains an average of at least five different topics, each\nbased on one or several sources. Since the chapter and section num-\nbers appear in the heading of each page, a desired topic is found\nquicker by reference to them and to the note mentioning the sources\nthan merely to a page number.\n\nBy its very nature, this volume tries to penetrate deeper into the\ninner life of the Geniza society, and I feel I need to present my cre-\ndentials.\n\nI do not believe that I would have been able to understand these\nancient parchments properly (I mean not only philologically, but also\npsychologically) had it not been for the many years of ethnolinguistic\nresearch 1 carried out among Yemenites, those most Jewish and most\nArab of all Jews. They consist of two markedly distinct groups: the\neducated townsmen, mostly highlanders, persons of a thoroughly\nMediterranean type—no barrier being felt between them and a Euro-\npean; and the primitive villagers from remote regions, mostly low-\nlanders, often people of great charm, especially the women—but from\nanother planet. Despite the differences in time, location, and historical\ncircumstances, familiarity with these two types of Oriental people\nhelped to throw light into many a dark corner of the Geniza world.\n\nSecond, and strange, as it may sound, I derived much profit for the\nunderstanding of the communal texts discussed in this volume from\nmy experience as senior education officer to the British Mandatory\nGovernment of Palestine during its woeful last decade (1938-1948).\nMy office was a curious blend of administrative, pedagogical, and\ndiplomatic activities and provided many insights into the workings\nof public bodies of different character and size. One of my many duties\nwas care of the schools of Oriental Jews. Following the outbreak of\nWorld War 11, these schools had lost most of their means of main-\ntenance, but, by statute, were not eligible for government assistance\nunless they had attained certain educational standards. Whether my\nwork with these institutions contributed anything to the improve-\nment of their administration and teaching, I do not know (assistance\nthey got, anyhow). That it was an excellent opportunity for me to\nbecome familiar with traditional Oriental education and the persons\nand bodies running it, about this, there is little doubt.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "Preface ix\n\nLast, and strangest of all, I believe I would have missed many as-\npects of the Geniza documents had I not been granted the opportunity\nof observing the American scene for many years. Authoritarian Ger-\nmany, where I spent my childhood and youth, and the Jewish society\nin Palestine and later Israel, with its socialist, welfare, and protec-\ntionist tendencies, which saw most of my working life, were utterly\ndifferent from the Geniza society, which was loosely organized and\ncompetitive in every respect. This vigorous free-enterprise society of\nthe United States, which is not without peity jealousies and often\ncheap public honors, its endless fund-raising campaigns and all that\ngoes with them, its general involvement in public affairs and deep\nconcern (or lip service, as the case may be) for the underdog—all\nproved to be extremely instructive. We do not wear turbans here; but,\nwhile reading many a Geniza document one feels quite at home.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate what I have said repeatedly in\npublic and in private: I regard this book and similar publications of\nmine solely as preparatory stages leading to the main task of Geniza\nresearch, the systematic edition of the original texts with full transla-\ntions, commentaries, and facsimiles. As a matter of fact, most of my\ntime during the last eighteen years has been devoted to the prepara-\ntion of such an undertaking. But while it was difficult—and possible\nonly under extreme privation—to produce a volume like the one pre-\nsented here without adequate financial aid, it goes without saying that\na comprehensive program of text editions cannot be carried out unless\nprovided with proper means. A powerful foundation, institution, or\na Maecenas should find here an opportunity for a monumentum aere\nperennius. Despite the difficult times through which we live at present,\nI confidently hope that the findings presented in this book will con-\nvince some readers that the sources on which they are based deserve\nto be brought to the knowledge of the scholarly world.\n\nWhen my mother, who had never known illness in her life, was\ncarried away by the all-European meningitis epidemic of 1920, I put\nthe quotation from the Talmud, printed in the Dedication, on her\ntombstone, (It is still there, in the deserted Jewish cemetery of Frank-\nfurt am Main, a few steps beyond the elaborate tomb of Paul Ehrlich,\nthe inventor of Salvarsan and Nobel prizewinner.) It gives me deep\nsatisfaction that now, exactly fifty years later, I am able to revive the\nmemory of that unusual woman: beautiful and well read, of stern\nprinciples, but unbounded kindness, steeped in the romantic idealism\nof the nineteenth century—and always silent and enigmatic.\n\nApril 3, 1970 S.

They\nwere not citizens of the principalities in which they happened to live\nbut were “protected” subjects, that is, their life, property, and honor\nwere safeguarded and the free exercise of their religion was per-\nmitted, as long as they paid their poll tax and submitted humbly to\nthe restrictions imposed on them by Islam.! The administration of\ntheir own affairs was left to themselves. Thus, they formed a state not\noaly within the state, but beyond the state, because they owed loyalty\nto the heads and to the central bodies of their respective denomina-\ntions, even though these were found in a foreign, or even hostile,\ncountry. On the other hand, a caliph or sultan ruling over a consid-\nerable number of non-Muslims, or even a government official in\ncharge of a city or a smaller locality, would find it advantageous to\nrecognize a representative dignitary or one or more notables who\nwould form a connecting link between a subject minority and him-\nself and who could be held responsible whenever convenient. The\necumenical, territorial, and local religious and semireligious authori-\nties of the various denominations thus served, as a rule, also as their\nofficial or semiofficial secular heads. The ecumenical or territorial\nleaders would appoint, or confirm the election of, local representa-\ntives wielding both religious and temporal authority.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "2 Introduction v\n\nSince the machinery of the state itself was loose in those days, the\ncoercive power of the denominational communities was even weaker.\nNevertheless, the cohesiveness of comparatively small groups, living\nunder the pressure of a majority of another faith, and the greater\ndedication of its members, largely compensated for this weakness.\n\nIn one, perhaps the most important, respect the Christian and\nJewish communities were even stronger than the amorphous masses\nof Muslims. They had carried over from Hellenistic and Roman\ntimes civic forms of communal organization which gave the indi-\nvidual member opportunity to be active in the life of the congrega-\ntion. The pre-Christian Jewish congregation grew out of the unique\nneeds of a religion that had abolished sacrifices and offerings every-\nwhere except in the Temple of Jerusalem. Prayer, as well as the\nstudy of the Holy Scriptures and the religious law, became a concern\nfor everyone and had to be organized on a local basis. Thus, there\narose the Synagogue (lit., the Assembly), the mother of the church.\nWhen Palestine and most of the Near East came under Greek, and\nlater Roman, domination, the trappings of secular corporation were\nadded to what had originally been a brotherhood of intrinsically\nreligious character. The result was a public institution of enormous\nvitality, developing in many different shades inside both Judaism and\nChristianity, This asset of a long-standing tradition was enhanced by\nthe tangible effect that the rise of a Middle Eastern bourgeoisie in\nearly Islamic times had on the non-Muslim population. Christians\nand Jews now belonged largely to the middle class of merchants and\nskilled artisans, of government officials and agents, and to the very\nprominent medical profession. These well-educated and experienced\nmen took a lively interest in the affairs of their community and strove\nhard for the honors bestowed on meritorious members. In addition to\nthis rivalry there often prevailed a marked tension between the\nnotables, who derived their influential position in the community\nfrom their connection with the government or from their riches, and\nthe rank and file, which insisted on having its full share in the deci-\nsions affecting the activities of the Church or the Synagogue.\n\nThe concerns of the community were manifold. There were ques-\ntions of religious dogma and ritual practice. Similarly, the upkeep\nof the houses of worship and the seats of religious learning, as well\nas the appointment and payment of the various community officials,\nrequired much attention. Furthermore, law in those days was per-\nsonal rather than territorial; an individual was judged according to\nthe law of the denomination to which he belonged.2 Almost the\nentire field of family law and also cases of inheritance and commer-\n\nGoitein, S.

Since Mus-\nlim juridical organization did not know the institution of a public\nprosecutor, however, it was left to the officials of the Church or the\nSynagogue to seek redress in case of an infringement of the rights of\ntheir coreligionists, or when unruly members of their own flock could\nnot be kept in line by the use of whatever powers of coercion were at\nthe disposal of the religious authorities. It is natural that Christians\nand Jews often applied to government courts, sometimes even in cases\nof communal strife and dissensions arising from their own religious\ntenets or ritual. This turning to government jurisdiction resulted in\nan interesting interplay of the various laws invoked. In everyday life,\nhowever, the ordinary citizen arranged his affairs before the denomi-\nnational courts, which were also cheaper (and perhaps less corrupt).\nAll in all, juridical autonomy was one of the most essential aspects\nof Christian and Jewish life in the countries of Islam during the High\nMiddle Ages.\n\nFinally, the social services, in our day the responsibility of state\nand local authorities, had to be provided in those times by the Church\nand the Synagogue. The education of children whose parents or other\nrelatives were unable to bear the costs, the care of orphans and\nwidows, of the poor and the old, the ill and the disabled, needy\ntravelers and foreigners, and, last but not least, the ransoming of\ncaptives—all were works of charity, expected to be carried out by\neach denomination for its own members. This entailed much organi-\nzation, often transcending the limits of a locality or even a country,\nand required a spirit of devotion to the common good, both of which\nmade for closely knit communities despite wide geographical dis-\npersion.\n\nThe heyday of the Middle Eastern bourgeoisie of the tenth through\nthe thirteenth centuries also saw the blooming of communal life of\nChristians and Jews under Islam. At the end of this period, when\nthe region succumbed to military feudalism and its corollary, Muslim\nclericalism, most of the ancient communal institutions waned or\ndisintegrated altogether. The very detailed information to be gath-\nered from the documents of the Geniza about Jewish public life\nshould form useful material for comparison of all the numerous and\nprosperous non-Muslim communities in medieval times. Moreover,\nit also had some bearing on the history of the Muslim middle class,\nwhich has not yet been sufficiently studied. It may well be that a\ncloser scrutiny of all the sources concerned may one day reveal that\ncertain traits of community life, which we are inclined to attribute\n\nGoitein, S. D.

It applies in\nparticular to the question of municipal corporation, to which much\nattention has lately been paid.3\n\nThe essence of a religious democracy is well defined in the book of\nDeuteronomy 1:13, where Moses says to the Children of Israel: “Get\nyou wise and capable men, who are well-known among your tribes,\nand I will make them heads over you.” It is left to the people to agree\non suitable representatives, but the spiritual leader makes the final\nchoice. Referring to this verse, a tenth-century head of a yeshiva, who\nwas also a prominent scholar, wrote this legal opinion, which may\nbe summarized as follows:\n\nIt has been asked why it is written: “Thou shalt establish judges\nand officers in all thy gates” (Deuteronomy 1:18)—in the singular and\nnot in the plural. The answer is this: The verse is addressed to the\nspiritual leader, on whom it is incumbent to appoint judges in Israel,\njust as Moses has said: (here follows Deuteronomy 1:13, quoted\nabove). Without the appointment by Moses, the election by the\npeople was not valid. Even Joshua's office, although he was chosen\nby God, was complete only after his investiture by Moses. The same\nis true of Saul and Samuel. All this proves that installment in an\noffice is incomplete unless it is done by the spiritual leader of any\ngiven period. In the absence of such leadership, however, each com-\nmunity is at liberty to make its own choice.*\n\nThe basic attitude expressed in the responsum summarized domi-\nnated Jewish public life during the Geniza period. The local or terri-\ntorial communities acted largely according to their own lights, but\nwere always eager to receive sanction and approval from some higher\nspiritual authority.\n\nModern democracy functions in an extremely formal and legalistic\nway. Each and every step, such as the election of representatives or\nthe fixing of a budget, is preceded or accompanied by the exact\ndescription of the procedures, by the promulgation of laws and by-\nlaws, and the taking and counting of votes. It lies, however, in the\nvery nature of things that, in reality, masses can be guided only by a\ncomparatively limited number of leaders and that the laws represent\nthe condensed expression of the powers actually ruling a people. The\nsociety reflected in the Geniza records (much as similar societies not\nonly under Islam but in contemporary Christendom as well) was far\nless legalistically minded, or, rather, did not feel the necessity of\nmaking laws because it had the safe guidance of the Law of God. The\nmodern historian would commit a grave error if he assumed that\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Al-\nthough formal decisions taken by public bodies were by no means\nentirely absent, the Geniza people had many other ways for making\nits will prevail. It must be conceded that, because of its comparatively\nlimited size, the Jewish community was, to a certain extent, excep-\ntional: everyone could be, and normally was, present in the syna-\ngogue when public affairs were discussed and decided upon. Constant\nsurveillance and action by a whole congregation were possible and,\nas we see, took place regularly. Still, it is my hope that this factual\nand detailed account of the functioning of the Jewish public body\nduring the Geniza period will be conducive toward a balanced view\nof medieval religious democracy in general.5\n\nA. ECUMENICAL AND TERRITORIAL AUTHORITIES\n\n1. The Gaon, or Head of the Academy, and the “Head\nof the Diaspora”\n\nThe eternal struggle belween authority and freedom can be miti-\ngated by rival authorities (such as legislature, administration, and\njudiciary), by the leadership’s need to have recourse to the led (“no\ntaxation without representation™), and by the uniting force of an\nidea, such as the striving for a new social order or the service of God.\nThe Jewish community represented in the Cairo Geniza records\nderived its very raison d’étre from its unfaltering allegiance to its\nreligion, while the other factors making for an intensive community\nlife, divided authority and a lively reciprocity between the leader and\nthe led, were likewise present.\n\nThe highest authority of the Jewish community was the yeshiva,\nrepresented by its head, the Gaon. Yeshiva is habitually rendered in\nEnglish as “academy.” For the period under discussion, rightly called\nthe gaonic period, the medieval “collegium” would be a more suitable\nequivalent. The yeshiva combined the functions of a seat of learning,\na high court, and a parliament (sec below, chap. vi, sec. 7). It wielded\nabsolute authority inasmuch as it interpreted the Law of God from\nwhose decisions there was no appeal. In view of this, it is strange\nthat there should have been three such bodies and not one: two in\nIraq (Babylonia) and one in Palestine. The Babylonian yeshivas\noriginally had their seats in two different localities, Sura and Pum-\nbedita, but each retained its name after moving to the capital, Bagh-\ndad.

The latter were\nbased on dogmatic schisms, that is, they denied to one another the\npossession of correct belief, whereas the three Jewish ecclesiastical\ncouncils recognized one another as equally orthodox and differed\nonly in matters of ritual and legal usage. To give just two, but rather\ntangible, examples: According to the Babylonian rite, the six yearly\nholidays were celebrated for two days each, whereas they were ob-\nserved for only one day each by the Palestinians. The Palestinian\nfamily law decreed that half the dowry of a woman who died childless\nreverted to her family, a practice not accepted by the Babylonians,\nAll these differences between the “Easterners” and the “Westerners”—\nas the Babylonians and Palestinians, respectively, were called—were\nlisted in special collections; this type of literature was later much\ndeveloped in Islam where similar conditions prevailed.!\n\nAlthough the centuries preceding and following the Arab conquest\nof the Middle East are the most obscure in Jewish history, it can be\nsaid with reasonable certainty that the Jewish communities of the\ncountries included in the Byzantine empire followed the Palestinian\nacademy, while those living under Persian rule were administered\nfrom Babylonia. The yeshivas of Babylonia divided among them-\nselves the provinces of the Persian empire according to mutual agree-\nment. In early Islamic times, when Egypt and North Africa became\ncolonial areas for immigrants from the East, and when, starting in\nthe tenth century, owing to the beginning of the devastation of Iraq,\nmany members of its middle class moved westward, the geographical\ndivision between “Easterners” and “Westerners” became entirely\nblurred. In many towns, there were now two Jewish congregations,\na “Palestinian” and a “Babylonian.” This was true not only of cities\nlike Old Cairo, Alexandria, Damascus, and Ramle, the adminis-\ntrative capital of Palestine, but also of smaller towns like al-Mahalla\nin Lower Egypt, Baniyas in Palestine, and Palmyra in Syria.?\n\nAs a corollary, in towns like Old Cairo, Alexandria, Ramle, Da-\nmascus, and Aleppo, a differentiation was made between the “large,”\nor main, and the “small,” or minor, synagogue. We are most probably\nright in assuming that the main synagogue in these formerly Byzan-\ntine towns was the Palestinian. For Alexandria and Ramle this is\nknown to be true and for Old Cairo it can be inferred. As for Damas-\ncus, the Muslim historians assert that only one synagogue was in-\ncluded in the treaty that delivered the city into the hands of the Arab\nconquerors (together with fourteen churches), which means that only\none was in existence in Byzantine times. A Geniza document from\n933 refers to “the small, namely, the Babylonian synagogue.”3\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The religious aspect of this schism is discussed in Med. Soc.,\nVolume 111, chapter x. As a social group, the Karaites presented a\nstrange picture. On the one hand, many of the richest Jews and of\nthose connected with the government (such as the Tustaris, often\nreferred to in this book) belonged to this sect. On the other hand,\nnowhere in Judaism do we find such outspoken condemnation of\nwealth and the wealthy and of the easy life of the diaspora as in the\npages of the early Karaites. These writers preached rigorous ascetism\nand called for immediate emigration to the Holy Land (where, in\nthose centuries, life was hard anyhow). This contrast has found full\nexpression in the Geniza documents. While in stern Palestine militant\nKaraites and Rabbanites were constantly at loggerheads—a state of\naffairs which engendered government interference more than once—\nin easygoing Egypt, friendly relations prevailed between the mem-\nbers of the high bourgeoisie belonging to the two denominations.\nIntermarriage was frequent, so common indeed that the Geniza has\npreserved not only actual marriage contracts between two such\nparties, but formularies showing how such “mixed marriages” should\nbe arranged so as not to hurt the religious sensitivities of either hus-\nband or wife. The Karaites did not recognize the religious authority\nof the Gaons since they represented rabbinic Judaism, but they felt\nthemselves to be, acted like, and were regarded as full members of\nthe Jewish community. (In this respect, the Karaites of the Geniza\nperiod differed considerably from those in czarist Russia and its\nsuccessor states. The well-integrated Karaites in the state of Israel\nhave all come from Egypt.) The Gaons of Jerusalem and Baghdad\nfreely applied to Karaite notables for help, both pecuniary and other\n(such as intercession with the government or aid in the settlement of\ncommunal strife). That aid was readily granted is proved by the\ngaonic correspondence in which praise is lavished on meritorious\nKaraites and God’s blessing is called upon them.4\n\nIt was different with the Samaritans, familiar to everyone from the\nNew Testament. This sect, which had already seceded from the main\nbody of Judaism in the time of the Second Temple (indeed, had\nnever fully belonged to it), did not recognize the Jewish religious\nauthorities. Occasionally, a Samaritan would turn to a Rabbanite\ncongregation for help or would join it outright. The Samaritan who\n\nGoitein, S. D.

We have two letters from a\nSamaritan carpenter, who possessed some Hebrew learning, in which\nhe describes hirmsell in moving terms as a Kohen and foreigner in\ngreat distress. He asked not for alms, but for work, emphasizing that\nhe could make “chests, bedsteads, doors and beams” (whereas each\nof these categories was usually made by craftsmen who specialized in\none or the other). He requested that “the head carpenter” be in-\nstructed to accept him (presumably during the restoration of the\nsynagogue of the Palestinians in the 1030’s) for the members of his\nown sect were too worldly minded to pay attention to a needy co-\nreligionist. He is alluding to the fact, known otherwise, that a section\nof the small Samaritan community had become prosperous and had\nquickly assimilated themselves to the Muslim environment. While\nthe documents mentioned contain about all the nonliterary Geniza\ntexts tell us about relations with Samaritans, they yield considerable\ninformation about Karaites. Still, these references are too spotty for\na complete inside story of this colorful sect. Thus, with a few excep-\ntions, the picture of Jewish communal life, as drawn from Geniza\nmaterial, of necessity is confined to the Rabbanites, the followers of\nthe yeshivas, and their Gaons.®\n\nThe adherence of a congregation to one of the two Rabbanite rites\nor, rather, to one of the three yeshivas, was expressed by no means\nsolely by its ritual and law. It also had an administrative aspect. A\nclose relationship existed between the central seats of Jewish learning\nand the individual communities attached to them. On recommenda-\ntion by their congregations the local leaders were appointed by the\nheads of the academies and were regarded as their deputies. A havér,\nor member of the academy, was usually chosen for the task. Thus,\n“havér” in the Geniza documents is to a large extent equivalent to\n“rabbi,” with the important qualification that, as a rule, he served\nnot only as spiritual leader, but also as president of his congregation.\nDuring most of the first half of the eleventh century the leader of the\nRabbanite community of Old Cairo was described as khalifa (cf.\ncaliph), or representative, of the Gaon of Jerusalem. Incidentally, the\ncontemporary bishop of Tunisia was designated by the same Arabic\nterm. An official of the synagogue of the Palestinians, writing to the\nsame Gaon, constantly uses the term “your synagogue.”¢ Similarly,\n“the congregations [plural!] praying in the synagogue of the Babylon-\nians” in Old Cairo, in addressing the head of an academy in Bagh-\ndad, refer to their synagogue as “the one that bears the name of your\nyeshiva.”7 In legal documents of the eleventh century, the court in\n\nGoitein, S.

In short, while it would be incorrect\nto speak about a Jewish clergy, in those times the Synagogue, not\nunlike the Church, was organized in a comparatively authoritarian\nmanner.\n\nThe ties linking a congregation to a yeshiva could last for many\ngenerations despite the immense distances separating the two. A\nGaon writing from Iraq to Spain in 953 mentions that religious and\nlegal queries sent from Spain to his great-grandfather and to his\ngrandfather (who between them had been in office for forty years)\nand even to the Gaons preceding them were still in his hands.2® It is\nno exaggeration to say that in most of the Gaonic letters preserved\nin their entirety the addressees are reminded of the long-standing\nbonds between the yeshiva and their own forebears or predecessors.\nMoreover, the Geniza material enables us to actually follow up such\nrelations between a yeshiva and local leaders during two or more\ngenerations not only with regard to larger cities, such as Old Cairo\nand Alexandria in Egypt, Qayrawan in Tunisia, and Fez and Sijil-\nmisa in Morocco, but also to smaller towns, such as Gabes in Tunisia.\n\nAlthough the yeshivas recognized the orthodoxy of their sister in-\nstitutions, they insisted that a community should follow at one time\nonly the guidance of one, that is, queries should not be submitted\nsimultaneously to two. When the scholars of Qayrawin once ad-\ndressed both Babylonian yeshivas with the same question, they\nreceived a stern rebuff: since decisions depended on reasoning, the\nyeshivas could arrive at different conclusions with the result that their\nrulings, instead of serving as a guide, could create confusion and dis-\ncord (ninth century).!® Public appeals, however, were held in one\nand the same congregation for all three yeshivas simultaneously, with\nthe lion’s share going to the one in closest contact with the donors, as\nevident from various letters referring to the same North African\ncity.?? The maintenance of yeshivas, as of other religious or educa-\ntional institutions, or even of single scholars, was a matter of religious\nduty and piety and not only one of specific indebtedness.\n\nThe prestige of a yeshiva depended on the scholarship and other\npersonal qualities of the man or the men who stood at its head.

When Saadya, a native of the\nFayyom in middle Egypt, became Gaon in Baghdad in May, 928, he\nsent a circular to Cérdoba, Seville, and five other cities in Spain, and\nprobably to other countries as well.1* But only the circular and a\nletter preceding it sent to Old Cairo have been preserved. In the\nletter, the head of the academy promises to seek redress for the griev-\nances of the addressees by approaching the central government in\nBaghdad through the influential Jewish court bankers residing in\nthat city. We have to bear in mind that during the twenties of the\ntenth century utmost disorder prevailed in Egypt, and at that time\nthe country was administered, albeit rather diffidently, from Bagh-\ndad % Besides this reference to the specific needs of the community\naddressed, the letter, written in highly stylized Hebrew, is devoted\nto two subjects: God's grace manifested in revealing his written and\noral law and the Gaon’s general concern for his flock, “for without\nan army there is no king and, without students, scholars have no\nsplendor.”18\n\nThe pastoral circular contained thirty points, of which the follow-\ning are of general interest. Men should fear God even in times of\naffluence, a clear indication of the generally prosperous state of at\nleast a section of the community at that time. No one should separate\nhimself from the congregational activities and duties, Supererogatory\nfasts and prayers had less value than the avoidance of a single sin.\nAlthough this preference for moral and religious punctiliousness over\nritual is familiar to the Bible reader from the Prophets (quoted, of\ncourse, in the circular), the special emphasis laid on it reflects the\ngeneral attitude of the medieval devotee, to whom hard, supereroga-\ntory works represented the essence of religious perfection. The circu-\nlar concludes with two admonitions referring to the academy itself:\none, to support the students of the sacred law, and another, to address\nall queries with regard to religious and legal matters to the Gaon\nand his school.17\n\nGoitein, S.

Some modern\nJewish scholars who have dealt with this material have felt rather\nuneasy about it finding it somewhat undignified. The reason for\ntheir judgment is to be found in the scholars themselves, however,\nfor all of whom were from continental Europe, where universities\nand colleges are usually maintained by the state. In Anglo-Saxon\ncountries, the finest institutions of higher learning are or used to be\nthe so-called private universities, that is, public institutions main-\ntained largely through private means. A Gaon soliciting funds was\nas natural a social phenomenon in the Jewish middle class society of\nthe High Middle Ages, as a president or vice-chancellor doing the\nsame in the United States or in England in our own day. The differ-\nence is, of course, that most of the relevant Geniza material comes\nfrom the late tenth through the twelfth centuries, when both Iraq and\nPalestine were laid waste by almost continuous warfare and other\ndisorders and the yeshivas often found themselves in utmost penury\nand distress. Of Iraq, once the richest of all Islamic countries, a\ntenth-century Gaon writes: “There is no country in the world in\nwhich destitution is as rampant as here in Babylonia.” In his letter,\nhe requests the addressees, scholars living in Spain, Morocco, or\nFrance, to send their contributions via the yeshiva's representative in\nQayrawin, Tunisia, to its honorary treasurer in Baghdad, who, most\ncharacteristically for this period, also happened to be a Tunisian.18\nThere is no need for quotations to prove the desolate state of Pal-\nestine in this period; references to its mounting devastation long be-\nfore the advent of the Crusaders are made throughout this book.\n\nGlowing descriptions of the splendor of the Babylonian yeshivas\nalso exist, however, and letters of solicitation were not confined to\ntimes of distress. By chance, the Geniza has preserved copies of a\ndossier of letters sent by a Gaon of Baghdad to Yemen and Yamima,\nthat is, to southwest and central Arabia. The letters show that the\nyeshiva had representatives in many small places all over the country,\nthat it was well informed about each of these men, and that the com-\nmunities sent their donations regularly. They also reveal the different\ntypes of donations made,'® a subject that is detailed in many other\nletters as well.

Indeed, one gets\nthe impression that a very ancient custom persisted in these yearly\nconsignments. In addition, special collections were made in the com-\nmunities from time to time.22\n\nPrivate generosity was another, and perhaps no less important,\nsource of income for the yeshivas. In times of danger or distress, as\nwell as on festive occasions such as holidays or family celebrations,\nvows of donations for the houses of learning were pronounced, and\nbequests were sometimes conferred upon them. Finally, it was cus-\ntomary to stipulate fines not for the benefit of one of the parties to\nthe contract, but for pious purposes, including the maintenance of\nthe yeshivas.\n\nThe Geniza also provides us with considerable information re-\ngarding the aid given to the Palestinian academy, first while it had\nits seat in Jerusalem and then after it had moved to Cairo in 1127.\nGifts were made not only to the institution as such, but in addition\nto its more prominent members individually, They consisted not only\nof cash, but also of precious robes and other textiles, of Oriental\nspices and other goods that could easily be converted into money.\nLetters of thanks have been preserved from which we learn that these\npresents were sent regularly.

The following incident may illustrate the situa-\ntion. A scholar from Egypt on his way to Baghdad, where he intended\nto continue his studies, was detained in Mosul.

It was intended to assert\nthe prerogative of the yeshiva as the highest authority in all dogmatic,\nritual, and legal matters, and it also served as a reminder to the local\nscholars to keep up with their studies. The teaching method in the\nyeshiva required the student’s preparation of a given text, on the\nbasis of which he was expected to ask questions to be discussed in the\nassembly of the scholars. Since study was not confined to school, but\nwas obligatory for one’s lifetime, the method pursued orally in the\nyeshiva was later on continued in writing. Many of the questions to\nthe Gaons which have come down to us are entirely theoretical. They\nwere prompted by the zeal of study, not by the need for the clarifica-\ntion of actual cases.\n\nStill, a large share of the questions submitted to the yeshivas was\nconcerned with practical problems, ritual, legal, dogmatic, and com-\nmunal. These queries were discussed by the member scholars, but, as\nfar as we know, unlike the yeshivas in Hellenistic and Roman times,\nneither the half-yearly conventions of the Babylonian schools, nor\nthe autumnal assemblies on the Mount of Olives or other meetings of\nthe Jerusalem yeshiva took formal votes. The Gaons certainly had to\ngive consideration to the opinions of the other members of the acade-\nmy and occasionally referred to them. Their responsa, or answers,\nwere styled in the form of personal, authoritative statements, how-\never, and sometimes heavenly inspiration was claimed (“Thus I was\nshown from Heaven”). Occasionally, the second in rank, the president\nof the court, would sign for the Gaon,? or (in Jerusalem) a reply\nwould be issued by the Gaon and the “Third” jointly (the president\nof the Jewish high court of Palestine had his seat in Ramle, the ad-\nministrative center of the country).26 But such cases were exceptional\nand noted as such.

Referring to it, Solomon b.\nJudah, the Gaon affected, writes: “I have only the name, but not the\npower, of my office.”?® The Gaon promoted or demoted the members\nof the academy and could expel undesirable elements altogether.30\nHe vigorously interfered in the internal affairs of the communities\nunder his control, upholding the authority of the leaders appointed\nby him (but admonishing them not to misuse their position) and re-\nstricting their opponents, if necessary, by outright excommunication.\n‘We have numerous examples for this in the letters of various Palestin-\nian Gaons, in particular in those of Solomon b.

About a\nhundred of his epistles have been preserved, completely or in part,\nand have attracted the attention of the scholars from the very outset\nof Geniza research. Yet, a good number of them are still unpublished.\nIt would be erroneous to ascribe these close connections between the\nGaon of Jerusalem and the Egyptian congregations simply to geo-\ngraphical proximity and to the fact that Palestine and Egypt formed\nparts of the Fatimid empire. As the rich correspondence from\nQayrawian shows, the Gaons of Baghdad insisted strongly on asserting\ntheir authority in a remote country like Tunisia, which was separated\nfrom them by more than one political boundary.\n\nThe Gaons were not elected as a rule, but followed each other\naccording to a complicated system of precedence, the president of the\nHigh Court attached to the yeshiva normally being the successor\ndesignate.

When the pilgrims from all over the Jewish\nworld, assembled on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem in Sep-\ntember, 1038, were dissatisfied with the handling of communal affairs\nby the old Gaon Solomon b. Judah, “they passed to the mansion of\nthe Shuway* family, took a Torah scroll and prayed over Nathan b.\nAbraham as Gaon. The subsequent Saturday they assembled in\nRamie in Nathan's Hall [where he used to officiate as supreme judge],\nwith no one remaining in the synagogues {which were under the\njurisdiction of Solomon] and asked Nathan to deliver the sermon\nand to expound the Scripture [the prerogative of the Gaon].”3¢ The\nagreement of 1042, reached in the Palestinian academy after this con-\ntest between the two Gaons (see n. 29), was made in the name of “the\nacademy and the elders of the community.” In a complaint sub-\nmitted to the caliph al-Mustansir during the communal strife, one\nparty, styling itself “the Rabbanite Jews,” stated that the governor\nof Ramle had no right to coerce them to follow a Gaon whom they\nhad not “chosen” and with whom they were not “satisfied.” After his\nreinstitution, Solomon b. Judah, the Gaon involved, declared that he\nowed his office neither to family connections nor to his own wisdom\nor riches (all of which he professed not to possess), but solely to “the\nwill of God and the people.”37\n\nSince the Gaon had judicial and administrative authority over the\nJewish community, it is natural that the government reserved itself\nthe right to confirm him in his office. When al-Zahir, the fourth\nFatimid ruler of Egypt (1021-1036), ascended the throne, a Gaon of\nJerusalem asked his friends in Fustat to obtain for him a letter of\ninstallment; the diplomas issued by the preceding three caliphs were\nstill in the possession of the yeshiva, A fragmentary, but highly in-\nteresting, Geniza document in Arabic characters, which was aimed\nat securing such a letter of installment from the Fatimid government,\nserves to conclude this survey. The details preserved give a fairly\ncomplete idea of the Gaon’s competence: (1) The Gaon has jurisdic-\ntion over only the Rabbanite persuasion (to the exclusion of the\nKaraites and Samaritans). (2) He is the highest authority on religious\nlaw and is entitled to expound it in public lectures. (3) In particular,\nhe supervises all matters of marriage and divorce.

Under Roman and\nPersian rules, respectively, a patriarch acted in Palestine as the repre-\nsentative of the Jews, and an exilarch, or “head of the Diaspora” per-\nformed the same function in Babylonia. Both derived their lineage\nfrom King David. The former office was abolished by the Byzantine\nemperors early in the fifth century, but the dignity of the Babylonian\nexilarch continued to exist and even attained new splendor under\nthe caliphs. The Muslims, like the Jews and Christians before them,\nregarded David, the reputed author of the Book of Psalms, as one of\nthe great prophets, and, with their respect for lineage, ranked the\nscions of such an ancient and noble line very highly, according to\none reference, even above the catholicus, or head of the very im-\nportant Nestorian Church. By the time of the Geniza records, how-\never, the rule of the caliphs themselves had become confined to a few\ndistricts in Irag—as far as they ruled at all-while the homage paid\nto them by Muslim rulers was of a purely honorary character. Simi-\nlarly, the head of the Diaspora exercised direct control over only a\npart of the Jewish communities in the lands of the Eastern caliphate,\nwhereas in the countries represented in the Geniza, the territorial\nJewish leaders accepted his “suzerainty,” if at all, only as a matter\nof form. As far as they were concerned, dispensing of honorific titles\nseems to have been his main function.??\n\nIn this period of the preponderance of the yeshivas an exilarch\ncould attain ecumenical status only when he was a scholar of rank or\ntook over outrightly the presidency of a yeshiva himself.

As far as\nwe are able to judge from his letters, Hezekiah did not assume the\ntitle of Gaon, but acted as one, since he answered questions of reli-\ngious law and exhorted his correspondents to submit their queries to\nand to support the scholars attached to him.4° In 1120 we again find\n\nGoitein, S.

Hisday for the Egyptian Gaon Nethanel ha-Levi. The\nlengthy document has acquired some renown because it was restored\nfrom three fragments preserved in New York, Cambridge (England),\nand Leningrad.*? The confirmation had been sought by the head of\nthe school in Cairo, because there existed a certain rivalry between\nhim and the Gaon in Damascus as to who was the true successor to\nthe Palestinian Gaon. (Jerusalem was occupied at that time by the\nCrusaders.) In the letter of confirmation, the exilarch presented his\nown credentials at length by stating that he had covered the whole\nfield of talmudic studies then usually pursued and by emphasizing\nthat, on God’s command, he had established a “high yeshiva” him-\nself. Clearly, in propping up the authority of the Egyptian Gaon he\nhad first to prove his own competence. It should be noted that docu-\nments issued in Fustat around 1090 in the name of the “High Court\nof the Résh Galathia” refer not to the exilarch of Baghdad but to\nDavid b. Daniel b. Azarya, who is soon to be discussed.*> The same\nholds true of a letter from Ascalon, Palestine, mentioning, inter alia,\ninstructions given by the Rosh ha-Goli (the Hebrew form of the\ntitle) to an official of the synagogue in that city.44\n\n1t is hardly necessary to mention that the office of the exilarch was\noccasionally hotly contested among various members of the House\nof David. Since the caliph reserved for himself the right to confirm\nthe appointment, it is natural that the Jewish courtiers and higher\ngovernment officials had a say in the matter. To such occurrences\nknown thus far the following might be added, one from February,\n1069, a time for which we have very little information about the\nexilarchate. A Muslim scholar, whose autograph diary has come down\nto us, makes the following entry during that month: “Dissension\nhas risen to its highest point among the Jews; they wanted to appoint\none particular man among the sons of David, but Ibn Fadlan op-\nposed them and wished to seat another one; they are still disputing\nabout that.” The notable referred to, Aba ‘Ali II 1bn Fadlan (who\nshould not be confounded with his namesake and presumable grand-\nfather who was involved in events of the year 998), was the senior\nJewish government officer at that time. When a Muslim fanatic in-\nduced the caliph to stop the work of the non-Muslim officials in 1058,\nIbn Fadlin and his Christian counterpart were ordered to stay home\ntogether with their corcligionist underlings. But soon the govern-\nment needed their services again. This explains why in 1069 we find\nIbn Fadlan having decisive influence on the election of an exilarch.t\n\nGoitein, S. D.

We find them\neverywhere, often trying to assume authority, even in faraway\nYemen.*¢ In 1051, one particularly gifted Davidite, Daniel b. Azarya,\nbecame head of the Palestinian academy, and a few decades later his\nson David tried to establish an exilarchate in Egypt, extending over\nthe whole Fatimid empire. It is characteristic of this state of affairs\nthat Daniel b. Azarya himself, in a pastoral letter, emphasizes that no\nmember of the House of David, and not even of his own household\nat that, was authorized to hold any public office except when ap-\npoint by himself.#7 In official documents written in Fustat in 1088\nand the subsequent years, David b. Daniel was entitled “the great\nnasi, the nasi of all [the diasporas of] Israel.” 48\n\nBy the end of the twelfth century we find nisis in Cairo, Alex-\nandria, and the Egyptian countryside. Others had their seat in\nDamascus, Aleppo, and Mosul. Members of the Mosul branch re-\nsided temporarily in Egypt, and a number of their letters have been\npreserved. Their doyen, Solomon b. Yishay (Jesse), appearing in\ndocuments and letters written in and around 1237, had no official\nstanding in the Jewish community of Egypt, but, being a scholar and\nmuch sought after preacher, he was influential and was addressed by\nthe same titles as the exilarch David b. Daniel one hundred and fifty\nyears before him.%® Although sometimes receiving emoluments from\nthe community, the nasis were of no real consequence, except when\nthey were scholarly persons of renown. Their role may be compared\nwith that of the Alids, or descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, in\nthe contemporary Muslim society.\n\nThus, the Jewish community, as it appears to us through the\nGeniza, had more than one communal authority, and these authori-\nties were dependent on their followers in different ways. The allegi-\nance of a congregation to a Gaon and other leaders was expressed in a\npublic prayer for their welfare inserted into the service. These\nprayers were by no means mere formularies, but contained specific\nreferences, for example, to the Gaon’s family or to his foes.5® The\ndispensing with this prayer indicated a break. As is well known, the\nChurch, and later on Islam, followed a similar procedure. When a\nCoptic priest ceased mentioning the patriarch’s name at the Holy\nEucharist, he demonstrated that he no longer recognized him as\nlegitimately installed.5* The Muslim Friday service was the occasion\nfor making a city’s loyalties known.

These\nprayers, too, had a “political” connotation, as they indicated who was\nregarded as the legitimate local representative of the Gaon. More-\nover, at these prayers, any person included was mentioned by his offi-\ncial or honorary title or titles, conferred upon him by the yeshiva.\nThe public prayer was thus the occasion for the formal conveyance\nof honors or privileges. “We prayed for him as a member” in an\nArabic letter from the beginning of the eleventh century means that\nthe person was officially recognized as a member of the yeshiva, and, as\nsuch, was qualified to serve as the spiritual (and temporal) leader of a\nlocal community.52\n\nBesides the synagogue service, there were many other occasions for\nthe expression of allegiance to an ecumenical or territorial authority.\nAt a public lecture it was customary for the lecturer to open with an\nexordium in which he would “take permission” from the authority\nto which he owed loyalty, the idea being that only the latter had the\nright to give an authoritative explanation of the Holy Scriptures. At\nweddings and banquets, a similar symbolic request for permission to\nsay grace was pronounced, since the Gaon, if present, would have\nbeen honored to say the benediction concluding a feast.58 Finally,\nscores of documents have been found bearing the remark that they\nwere written in the name of the leader, or leaders (such as “the Gate”\n[the court] of the yeshiva) to whom communal allegiance was due, for\nthe judges or other persons issuing the documents were regarded as\ndeputies of the man or institution in power at the time. The com-\nmon term for all these various expressions of loyalty—whether in the\nsynagogue, at a banquet, or in the courtroom—was reshiith, literally,\n“taking permission.”\n\nOf the many hundreds of documents bearing such an authorization\nthe most impressive is perhaps the bill of manumission given on Mon-\nday, October 17, 1132, to the slave girl Ashi in the city of Mangalore\non the Malabar coast of India. Her former proprietor (and, I suspect,\nlater husband) Abraham Yija, a Tunisian merchant, industrialist,\nscholar, and poet, who has left about eighty items of his in the Geniza,\nwrote this document in his own exquisite hand, introducing it thus:\n“In the city of Mangalore . . ., the royal city, which is situated on\nthe Great Sea and which is under the jurisdiction of our Lord Daniel,\nthe great prince, the head of the Diaspora of all Israel, the son of our\nlord Hisday, the great prince . .., and also under the jurisdiction of\nour Gaon Masliah ha-Kohen, the head of the yeshiva Ge’ 6n Ya ‘agov\n[the Palestinian academy], the son of Solomon, the head of the\n\nGoitein, S.

To make the geographical diversity complete:\nthe deed is preserved today in the Institute of the Peoples of Asia in\nLeningrad.5\n\nIncidentally, such references to the personalities or institutions un-\nder whose authority a document was issued are our main source for\nthe chronology of Jewish history under Islam during the High Mid-\ndle Ages.5s\n\nThe double loyalty expressed in the Mangalore document reflected\npractical considerations: The Jewish merchant colonies on the west\ncoast of India originated partly in Iraq and Iran and partly in the\ncountries of the Mediterranean basin. Therefore, the documents is-\nsued by their courts had to pay homage to the Jewish authorities\npredominant in each of these two areas. The same was true of the\nJews of Yemen, who, since olden times, had been in closest contact\nwith the Iragian yeshivoth, but became, in the wake of the lively\nIndia trade, even more attached to their coreligionists in Egypt and\nthe countries adjacent to it. From Aden in the south to Sa ‘da in the\nnorth public prayers used to be said over the exilarch of Baghdad\nand Gaon Masliah of Cairo. The harmony was disrupted when an\nambitious relative of the head of the Diaspora arrived in Aden in\n1184 and claimed exclusive authority for the exilarch (and himself,\nof course, as the latter’s local representative).®\n\nThe Aden controversy of 1134, which is reflected in several Geniza\ndocuments, shows that the custom of “taking permission,” while con-\nducive in general to communal cohesiveness, was apt to lead to con-\nfusion in times of discord. Therefore, there were congregations that\ntried to do away with these time-honored symbols of unity altogether.\nThe Geniza contains much material about this contest for and against\nthe reshiith. After the death of Moses Maimonides, his son Abraham\nattained the leadership of the Jews of Egypt at a very tender age,\nwhereupon he met with strong opposition. Many people stayed away\nfrom the synagogues and opened private prayer assemblies because\nthey objected to the reshiith pronounced in his name. In order to re-\nstore peace, a statute was adopted, to be valid for thirty years, abol-\nishing the custom of reshiith and excommunicating anyone estab-\nlishing a private place of prayer.8” This statute must have been\nrescinded not long after its adoption, for less than ten years after the\ndeath of Moses Maimonides we find his son Abraham regularly re-\nferred to as the head of the community in the preambles to legal\n\nGoitein, S.

D, 2).\n\nEven a cursory reading of the correspondence of the Gaons reveals\nthe diocesan organization of the Jewish community. The official title\ntitle of Ephraim b. Shemarya, so often mentioned in these pages, was\n“permanent court [i.e., judge] for Fustat and all its districts.”’® The\nGaons always insisted that all contributions be sent to them through\nan acknowledged leader in charge of a district or a country, that all\nletters to the yeshiva likewise be forwarded solely through him, and\nthat he be revered and honored and his instructions followed with-\nout wavering. In the letters to south Arabia, referred to above (p. 11),\nplaces hundreds of miles nearer Baghdad than San ‘a, the capital of\nYemen, were advised to send their donations and letters solely\nthrough the judges (the biblical word shéfét is used) in that city.

There is also hardly\none that has been so thoroughly misrepresented by modern historical\nresearch.\n\nThe reason for this deficiency is to be sought in the fact that the\ndignity of Nagid (pronounced nagheed), as the territorial head of the\nJewish community was called in Hebrew, was described by the Jewish\nauthors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in terms suited\nto the pericd immediately preceding its abolition in 1517. Their\naccounts were corroborated by those of Muslim authors writing in\nlate Mamluk times. This double testimony was so impressive that\nmost historians dealing with the subject were inclined to interpret\nthe new material emerging from the Cairo Geniza in the light of the\nlater developments reflected in the literary sources. Characteristic in\nthis respect is this statement of Jacob Mann, the greatest authority on\nGeniza research: “From the Fatimid regime (969) to the conquest of\nthe country by the Turks (1517) Egyptian Jewry was strongly organ-\nized under the Nagid, who was the chief of the Rabbanites, Karaites\nand Samaritans alike, recognized by the government as Ra'is al-\nYahid.” 2\n\nIn reality the situation was far more complicated. The title\n“Nagid” does not appear in Egypt until about 1065, almost a hundred\nyears after the Fatimid conquest, and it was not in continuous use\neven after its inception. Only from the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury did the Hebrew title “Nagid” become permanently attached\nto that of Ra'is al-Yahiid, “The head of the Jews.” In general, we\nhave to distinguish between the title and the office, and, as far as the\noffice is concerned, we have to keep in mind that the combination of\n\nGoitein, S.

As\ntitle, it is an abbreviation of such high-sounding phrases as “Prince\nof the Diaspora,” “Prince of the People of the Lord [or: of Israel],”\nor “Prince of Princes.”3 As far as we are able to see, the first to have\nborne this title was Abraham b. ‘Ata’, physician in attendance to\nBadis and his son al-Mu'izz, the rulers of Tunisia and some adjacent\nterritories, during the first half of the eleventh century. Abraham b.\n‘Ata’ used his influential position to protect his coreligionists in a\nperiod that witnessed a general increase in fanaticism and disorders\nin that country. Moreover, he was a staunch supporter of the Jewish\nseats of learning in Baghdad, in particular of their great leader, Hay\nGaon (d. 1088), and in recognition of his many merits Hay conferred\non him, in spring 1015, the title Nagid. Abraham’s father, ‘Ata’, or\nNathan (both mean “gift,” the first in Arabic, the second in Hebrew),\nalready had occupied a similar position of communal leader, but with\nthe more modest, and more widely used, title “head of the congrega-\ntions.”s The title Nagid was not entirely new, it had already been\ngiven by an Iraqi yeshiva to a prominent lay member (who was, how-\never, of a family of Gaons) around 900. It was common practice that\ntitles borne first by dignitaries of, or connected with, the academies\nof Baghdad or Jerusalem, were later on bestowed also on meritorious\npersons abroad.® Thus the title “Prince of the Diaspora” as designa-\ntion for the leader of the Jewish community of a country, was by no\nmeans created in opposition to the office of the exilarch, the “head\nof the Diaspora,” but grew organically from the way in which the\nyeshivas were used to confer honorary epithets.”\n\nIbn ‘Ata’s successor, Jacob b. Amram, is called in a legal document,\nwritten in Fustat, 1041-1042, “Prince of the Diaspora,” but is simply\naddressed as “the Nagid” in letters, even official letters addressed to\nhim from the community of Palermo, Sicily, or from the exilarch of\nBaghdad.® His activities, as known to us through various Geniza let-\nters, resemble in many respects those of the Egyptian Nagids at their\nheight, known to us from later times. He was a powerful protector of\nhis flock, a stern keeper of law and morals in the community, an ad-\nministrator of justice whose impartiality was famous, and a shicld for\nthe weak.

For in one Geniza letter we read\nthat instead of making the annual appeal for the academy of Jerusa-\nlem, the Nagid arranged for a big collection for a Riimi relative who\nhad been robbed while traveling between Salerno and Bari in south-\nern Italy. (The letter assures us that the Jerusalem appeal was carried\nthrough anyway, albeit belatedly.)!® Around 1060, when the Nagid\nhad fallen into disgrace with the ruler and had to quit the country he\nlived “beyond the sea,” west or north of Tunisia. This could have\nbeen Muslim Spain, but also Christian Europe. The Tunisian mer-\nchants in Egypt kept their allegiance to him, organized a levy for the\nexile (but the money was lost in shipwreck), and paid heed to his\ninstructions. But in Tunisia the office of Nagid had come to an end.\nIt had a short sequel in Sicily, when the western part of the island\nwas dominated by Ayyib, the son of Tamim, the Zirid ruler of\nTunisia (ca. 1064) . “He appointed Zakkir b. ‘Ammér as Nagid over\nthe Jews ... because he administered also most of his own\naffairs.” 11\n\nSamuel Ibn Nagrela, the Jewish vizier of Granada, Spain, received\nthe title Nagid in or around 1027 (most probably also from Hay\nGaon). It became part of his proper name in his lifetime; he is known\nin Jewish history and Hebrew literature simply as Samuel ha-\nNagid.’2 With his son Joseph (or, rather, Yehoséf), who was killed in\n1066, the title lapsed in Spain, as it did simultaneously in Tunisia.13\n\nAt exactly the same time the title makes its appearance in Egypt,\nwhere it was held by the scholar and court physician Judah b.

Hananya (1140-1159), who is sometimes confused with his still\nmore famous Spanish namesake. His predecessor in the leadership of\nthe Jews of Egypt, the Palestinian Gaon Masliah (1127-1139), and his\nsuccessors, the Gaons Nethanel and Sar Shalom, were, as their title\nimplies, heads of schools. The long-standing controversy, whether\nMaimonides (arrived in Egypt around 1165, died 1204) was Nagid or\nnot, is entirely futile. There is no doubt that he was appointed by the\ngovernment at some time as “head of the Jews,” but he never bore\nthe title Nagid, most probably because he did not care to and because\nno one was willing to confer it on him.}7 He was followed by his son\nAbraham in his office as Ra’ls, who, in documents from December,\n1213, is regularly styled Nagid.’8 We can only surmise the reason for\nthis change. Abraham was embarrassingly young when he took office,\nand met with much opposition, particularly with regard to his pietis-\ntic and ascetic reforms. Perhaps the title was secured for him by his\npartisans in order to strengthen his position. In any case, the abun-\ndant wealth of Geniza material from his period enables us to observe\nhow it became absolutely de rigueur to issue a legal document in any\npart of Egypt as under the authority of the Nagid. Since Abraham\nMaimonides was followed by at least four 1 Nagids from his offspring\nduring a period of over 170 years, it is natural that the title became\nidentified with the office, and as such passed into literary usage.\nSporadically, and specified by the name of the country for which\nthey were responsible, Nagids were found also in Yemen on the one\nhand, and in Syria and Palestine on the other. While the Geniza has\npreserved rich information about the former, we know hardly more\nthan the names of the latter. It is therefore premature to surmise\nunder which circumstances the Syro-Palestinian version of the dignity\ncame into being and of what type it was. As for Yemen, our sources\nare indicative enough. Owing to the growing importance of the India\ntrade, the Jewish representative of the merchants in Aden became a\npowerful figure in those parts. One of them, Madmiin b. Japheth b.\nBundar, was honored by the head of the Diaspora of Baghdad with\nthe title “Prince of the Land of Yemen,” which after his death in\n1151 was bestowed also on his son Halfon (d. 1172) . A tombstone of\na Nagid Halfon, son of a Nagid Madmiin (presumably their descen-\ndants) bears the date August, 1248. They were preceded by a Shem-\narya b. David, a maecenas of poets and scholars (Hebrew Shemarya\nhas the same meaning as Arabic Madman: “Protected by God”). The\nseries of Yemenite Nagids concludes with David b.

There\nis no need to repeat here the passages dealing with the office of the\nRa’is al-Yahid, or “head of the Jews,” in the late Muslim handbooks\nof administration, for most of these passages are available, con-\nveniently collected, in an English translation.?t\n\nThe office of the Ra'is (or Rayyis, as the word is spelled in the\nGeniza records) is described by the Muslim scholars of the [ourteenth\nand fifteenth centuries as corresponding to that of the patriarch of\nthe Christians.

The strongest bonds of cooperation existed be-\ntween the Jews living within the borders of the Fatimid empire and\nthe Jewish academies of Baghdad, and as far as we have documents\nabout the appointment of the heads of the community in Egypt, we\nsee that they were installed by and received honorary titles from the\nhead of the Diaspora who had his seat in Iraq and even more from\nthe yeshivas there. The origin of the office of the Nagid, like that of\nthe Christian patriarchs with which it was compared by the Muslim\nauthors, is to be sought in developments taking place inside the com-\nmunity that it represented. While saying this, I am not unaware of\nthe fact (alluded to on the first page of this chapter) that everywhere,\neven in a small town, the Muslim authorities found it convenient to\nrecognize a prominent member of a “protected” community as its\nresponsible representative.

It is perhaps worthy to note that the\nmost prominent of them, Aba Sa‘d al-Tustari, who for some time\nwielded utmost power over the empire, was a member of the Karaite\nminority group. Nowhere is it stated that these powerful men had\nany official standing in the community. As tar as our sources show,\nall legal authority was exercised in the name of the Gaons, or heads\nof the yeshivas.38\n\nThings changed in the ten sixties when the Jerusalem yeshiva was\nmuch weakened by the rivalry between the nasis from the royal house\nof David, who had come from Iraq, and the priestly Gaons of Pales-\ntine. Moreover, in 1071 Jerusalem was conquered by the Seljuks, and\nthe yeshiva had to move into exile, first to Tyre on the Lebanese coast\nand later on to Damascus, In these times of eclipse of the central\nJewish authority there happened to be in Egypt a family that com-\nbined noble descent and a tradition of scholarship and piety with an\ninfluential position at court. The distinguished position of the\nbrothers Judah and Mevarikh, sons of Saadya, mentioned above, was\nexpressed by their bearing the highest titles from the yeshivas of both\nPalestine and Babylonia; from around 1065, Judah, and some time\nafter his death, Mevoriakh were honored also with the epithet Nagid.\nTheir leadership was by no means undisputed. It was challenged by\nthe same nasi David b. Daniel who had claimed the gaonate in\nJerusalem. By 1095, however, Mevarakh was firmly established as the\nhighest authority of the Jews in the Fatimid realm. He occupied this\nposition uncontested until his death in a plague on March 30, 1112,\nand was succeeded by his son Moses without any opposition. Our\nsources expressly state that Mevorakh was appointed by the govern-\nment and show him in close cooperation with al-Malik al-Afdal, the\nmighty viceroy and actual ruler. Many letters addressed to him and\nothers emanating from his office reveal his manifold activities as\ncommunal leader, and numerous documents issued under his au-\nthority (instead of that of the yeshiva) have been preserved. In a letter\naddressed to him he is described as installed in his office by God. The\nnist (probably a Davidite living in Egypt) is quoted in it as declaring\nthat no one except God was above the Nagid. Mevérikh is to be\nregarded as the initiator of the office of the head of the Jews in its\ndouble function as representative of the Jewish community before\nthe Fatimid government and as highest legal and religious authority\n\nGoitein, S.

We possess an enormous number of letters\nand documents from the eleventh century—dated documents for prac-\ntically every year from 1002. This material reveals to us, positively,\nhow the community functioned, and negatively, that while the head\nof the Jews was duly mentioned as the highest religious authority in\nlegal documents of the time of Mevérikh and later, nothing of the\nkind appears in documents preceding him. Jewish historiography\nmust finally be prepared to give up preconceived theories in the face\nof the facts disclosed to us by the Cairo Geniza.\n\nFrom the time of Mevérikh to the end of the classical Geniza\nperiod there is a constant flow of sources about the leadership of the\nJews in Egypt and the adjacent countries. It is possible therefore to\nform a concrete idea about the nature and the scope of this office\nduring that time.\n\nOn the subject of the appointment of a rayyis, it would be incon-\nsistent with the spirit of the age to expect formal elections, followed\nimmediately by an official installation by government. Things were\nfar less formal and far more intricate. The rayyis had to seek support\nfrom three different sources: the Jewish local and territorial com-\nmunities that would accept him as their leader; the Jewish ecumen-\nical authorities who would acknowledge him and confer on him “a\nnew name” and some additional honorary titles; and finally the gov-\nernment that was to confirm him officially in his position. The\nsequence in which these three were obtained depended entirely on\nthe circumstances.

Obviously, the Jewish ecu-\nmenical authority that conferred this title was slow in recognizing\nhim.#2\n\nThe informal way in which the appointment of a Nagid by the\ngovernment was secured is well exemplified by a document from the\nthirteenth century. It refers to David Maimonides who took office\nin 1237 at the tender age of sixteen, which, by the way, shows how\nquickly this dignity, after it had become well established under his\nfather Abraham, had become a hallowed, hereditary institution. A\nfew notables had talked to all the persons of consequence in the gov-\nernment, and the latter accepted the proposal with enthusiasm. The\nofficial responsible for such matters demanded only that ten elders\nappear before him so that he could sound out the opinion of the\ncommunity. The document goes on to say that the persons who had\ntaken the initiative were assembled together with the Davidite nasi\nand the judges in the synagogue of the Palestinians and asks nine\npersons listed by name to join them there without delay, together\nwith whomever they could get hold of. The list is comprised of a man\ncalled “The Pride of the State,” presumably a government official,\nsome physicians and merchants, and also a veteran schoolmaster.43\n\nAppointment was normally for a lifetime. The office of the rayyis\nwas partly a political one, however, and therefore exposed to the ups\nand downs of politics, both of the state and of the Jewish community.\nAs alluded to above, Mevérakh himself had to cede his place for some\ntime to the exilarch David b.

Several documents written\naround 1090 and signed by the most prominent members of the com-\nmunity were issued under the authority of the latter and there are\nletters congratulating Mevorakh after his return to power.4* The\ncourt physician and head of the Jews Abia Mansiir Samuel b. Hana-\nnya (1140-1159) fell into disgrace for a time through the intrigues of\nthe impostor Zutta.45 Earlier, he had been in danger of losing his\nposition to another rival, a member of the family of the two Gaons\nwho came to power after him.46 Samuel’s successor in both his pro-\nfessional and public functions, the Gaon Nethanel ha-Levi, had ceded\nhis dignity to another rayyis before the spring of 1169, but lived on\ncomfortably at least another fifteen years on a generous pension\ngranted him by his former master. Evidently, when he retired from\nthe service of the caliph, he also resigned his post as leader of the\nJewish community.47 His brother Sar Shalom ha-Levi held the office\nin 1170 and again in 1177 through 1195 (at least), but he was replaced\nin 1171 by Maimonides for a number of years.

When Mai-\nmonides was reappointed at the end of his life, an enthusiastic pupil\ncongratulated him saying that his acceptance of the office was an\nhonor for the Jewish people and for the dignity of the rayyis, but a\ncatastrophe for scholarship.** The family of the ha-Levi brothers,\nwith whom Maimonides had competed for leadership almost [rom\nthe time he set foot on the soil of Egypt, tried to dislodge his son\nAbraham after he had succeeded his father. As we have seen, how-\never, during most of his time in office, legal documents written in\nEgypt regularly bear his name.5®\n\nTurning now to the rights and duties of the rayyis, we discern as\nthe most conspicuous aspect of his office his capacity as highest\njuridical authority of the community. He appoints the chief judges,\nwhile the appointments of the other community officials are made\nby the latter with his approval, and in certain cases by him directly.\nThe vast change brought into the public life of the Jews of Egypt\nand Palestine in the last third of the eleventh century is best exempli-\nfied by the fact that the courts in Old Cairo and in other places no\nlonger describe themselves as appointed by the yeshiva, but by “our\nlord” Mevorikh, or, during the latter’s eclipse, by his rival, the\nexilarch.5' Long years after Mevorakh's death the two chief judges\nof Old Cairo describe themselves as installed by the late Nagid (and\nas reinstalled by his son and successor).52 Soon it became habitual to\nname in every document the head under whose authority it was\nissued.\n\nAs the many relevant Geniza records prove, the appointment and\nsupervision of the community officials outside the capital must have\nbeen one of the main concerns and headaches of the Nagids. In those\ndays, a large section of the Jewish population was still living in small\ntowns or villages. The administrative districts, although fixed by\ncustom, were by no means rigidly defined. Thus, each new appoint-\nment required a careful description of the appointee’s district. En-\ncroachments by ambitious community leaders, or mugaddams, must\nhave been common. Furthermore, in one and the same place more\nthan one functionary was normally in office, and in this respect, too,\nthe exact definition of everyone’s duties and prerogatives required\nthe Nagid’s attention. Similarly, the relation between the judges in\ncharge of a district and the local heads had to be regulated. Naturally,\nthere were sometimes complaints about the scholarly competence of\nthe persons appointed or their capacity to guide the community.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Others left\nin the wake of communal strife. It scems to have been the Nagids’\npolicy to persuade the congregations to take their former leaders back.\nWe read about visits of the highest Jewish dignitary to communities\noutside the capital and even of his spending the High Holidays there\nand leading the congregation during a part of the service in one of\nthem. This was probably regarded as the bestowal of a high honer\nby the community.5®\n\nAlthough the rayyis was the supreme judge, he normally did not\ngive judgments in person. Anyone dissatisfied with the handling of\nhis case by a local court could submit a petition to him (often through\na high-standing person) whereupon the rayyis would instruct the\ncourt or the local community, or both, how to deal with the com-\nplaint. An early example of this procedure may be studied in a letter\nof the Nagid Judah, Mevorakh'’s elder brother.5* A widow in a little\ntown, who happened to be the sister of an influential banker, was\nabout to be deprived of her rights in her late husband’s house by her\nin-laws. The Nagid, having been approached by her brother, wrote\nto the congregation (women and children included!) and to the local\njudge that the case be settled either by compromise, preferably, or\nby an oath to be taken by the widow. Under no circumstances should\naction on the case be delayed.\n\nThis type of legal procedure pervaded the whole fabric of com-\nmunity life, as it appears to us in the Geniza papers. It is almost\nunnecessary to observe that the same form of juridical organization\nprevailed in contemporary Istam. A party who felt itself wronged\nwould apply to the caliph (or to whomever happened to be the actual\nruler) for a rescript in his favor, whereupon a qadi would deal with\nthe matter in the spirit of the caliph’s ruling. Thus, in the case of the\nwidow just mentioned, her brother, the influential banker, had al-\nready obtained a caliphal rescript to a qadi but was prepared not to\nuse it, provided the Jewish authorities redressed his sister’s grievance\nwith reasonable expediency. It is hard to say whether the Nagid's\nposition in the judiciary system owed to Muslim influence, or\nwhether he had simply adopted the role of the Gaon, whom he had\nreplaced in the leadership of the Jewish community. Since pre-\nChristian times, the head of the yeshiva was seconded by the presi-\ndent of the High Court, and, as we learn from the Geniza, the Gaon\nfollowed the same procedure of giving instructions to the court or\ncourts under his jurisdiction, as was later done by the Nagid with\nregard to the judges he himself appointed.s It is not impossible that\n\nGoitein, S.

Both the community as a\nwhole and its individual members needed him whenever they were\nin trouble. He was the “savior of a people with little power,” as we\nread in one petition to a Nagid.5¢ His hayba, the respect paid him,\nwas his most effective instrument of ruling. He could punish recalci-\ntrant offenders with a temporary ban or with total excommunication.\nBut as long as the Nagid was held in high esteem by the government,\nfrom Mevorakh to Abraham Maimonides, little use was made of this\nextreme means of disciplinary action. Only in later centuries, when\nthe position of the protected minorities and with it that of their\nleaders had deteriorated irreparably, even small transgressions were\nthreatened or punished with excommunication. This is the reason\nthat the right to pronounce the ban is so prominent in the description\nof the office of the rayyis in the Muslim sources, which are all later\nthan our period.\n\nNo police or prisons were at the disposal of the head of the Jews.\nWhenever we read about raqqdsin, or policemen, sent by a Nagid,\nthe context implies that they were members of the state police (which\nJews could join in those days). It was normally the Nagid, however,\nwho ordered or gave permission to turn over a coreligionist to the\nstate authorities. Because of the legal position of the minority groups\nthis was almost an act of extradition.57\n\nThe Nagid’s role of peacemaker in his community was not confined\nto matters of a purely legal character. He had to occupy himself with\na wide variety of disputes, which he tried to settle by mediation, by\ninstructions to his officials, or through intervention by the govern-\nment. A few examples suffice. An old and ailing muqaddam and his\ntwo brothers, who had become purveyors for the government and the\narmy upon the recommendation of the Nagid and shared with their\nhandicapped brother the burdens of the community, were menaced\nin their position by the competition of two Syro-Palestinian silk-\ndyers.

Still, it seems that major grievances\nwere brought before the rayyis.\n\nThe Muslim sources emphasize the duty of the rayyis “to protect\nthe Muslims from the Jews,” that is, to see to it that the discrimina-\ntory laws against non-Muslims, like wearing distinctive signs on one’s\nclothing, be observed. This again reflects a later and more fanatic\ntime, regarding which we read in Muslim historians that the Coptic\npatriarch and the head of the Jews solemnly undertook actually to\nexcommunicate any member of their respective communities not\ncomplying with the discriminatory laws. In the records from the\nclassical Geniza period we find no trace of such measures originating\nfrom the rayyis. At most he warns against any actions that could lead\nto friction with people of other faiths.\n\nIt has often been stated that the rayyis was in charge of the collec-\ntion of the jaliya, the poll tax incumbent on non-Muslims, an\nassertion not borne out by the immense Geniza material bearing on\nthe subject. The poll tax was normally collected by government\nofficials, either directly or through tax-farmers. In some respects,\nhowever, the jiliya presented a major concern to the rayyis. The old\nrule of Muslim law that indigent persons were exempted from this\ntax was no longer observed in this period. Whoever was unable to\npay was imprisoned and otherwise maltreated to the point of facing\ndeath. It was up to the community and above all the rayyis to guard\nthe poor from that predicament. It seems also that the rayyis, like\nany other communal leader, was occasionally consulted regarding\nthe estimate of a person’s financial capacity. Finally, in the case of a\npoor community, the rayyis sometimes must have taken care of the\ntax for all members, coming to an agreement with the more capable\nmembers concerning their share and making good for the insufficient\nor lacking contributions through donations or public funds. For\nexample, in the fourteenth century when Old Cairo had become a\ndesolate place, the Nagid ruled at one point that the tax would be\npaid temporarily out of a fund destined for orphans and widows.?\nIn another letter by the same Nagid to that impoverished community\nhe warns them as follows: “No one from this office will come out to\nyou this time. The tax collection will be carried out by the director\nof finance, the mugaddam [who would help with the estimate] and\nthe government banker. So let every one of you be prepared to pay\nthe tax and the fines [for the arrears].”” Incidentally, concerning\nthese matters we need not rely on information provided by the\nGeniza, rich as it is.

It was called “the holy congregation,” a postbiblical version\nof “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6). This\ndesignation was already in use in pre-Islamic times and then during\nthe entire Geniza period, from the time of the few Hebrew papyruses\npreserved down to our latest papers written in Arabic language, and\nno difference was made in this respect between congregations in\nimportant cities, such as Jerusalem, Old Cairo, or Alexandria, and\nthose found in the smaller towns of Palestine, Egypt, or Asia Minor.\nOccasionally, high-sounding epithets, like “the assembly of God,”\nwere employed. Often, a congregation is referred to simply as\n“Israel,” because the local cell represented the whole body of the\ncommunity.!\n\nThere was a strong feeling that next to God, as revealed in his\nLaw, it was the people that wielded the highest authority. The\nbearers of dignities regarded themselves as installed by both.2 The\ncommunal officials would be chosen and resolutions adopted by the\ncommunity as a whole, and not only by the leading notables, al-\nthough the latter, naturally, made the main decisions. A man who\nconsidered himself wronged would appeal to “Israel,” that is, the\nlocal congregation assembled for prayer, a custom of deep signifi-\ncance for both legal procedure and life in the synagogue (see sec. D,\n2, and chap, vii, sec. B, 3, below). The local community acted as\njudge or rather as jury, in particular when it was small and without\na spiritual leader of higher rank. A document from spring, 1020,\nopens with these words: “This happened in our presence, we, the\ncommunity of Syracuse {Sicily] constituted as a court.” At approx-\nimately the same time a similar phrase was used in a letter addressed\nby the gahal, or congregation, of $ahrajt in Lower Egypt to the\n\nGoitein, S.

The practice would be followed even when the con-\ngregation addressed included a renowned rabbinical authority and a\nNagid (as in the case of a letter by the congregation of Palermo,\nSicily, to that of al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia), or in statements of a purely\nlegal character (as in a letter addressed in 1028 by the community of\nTyre, Lebanon, to that of Aleppo, or one sent in 1034 from Old Cairo\nto 2l-Qayrawan). Such letters were written with utmost care in both\nscript and style and were preceded by long exordiums praising the\npiety, justice, charity, and learnedness in which a Jewish community\nwas supposed to excel. As a rule, the various groups of which a con-\ngregation was composed were mentioned individually.’\n\nAn ecumenical or territorial authority, while instructing his repre-\nsentatives about specific matters, such as help for a needy person, a\nlegal case, or an appointment, would extend greetings to the com-\nmunity, often specifying the various groups and classes of people\nof which it consisted. Reading the Geniza letters side by side with\nthe epistles in the second book of the Maccabees, the Talmud, or\nthe New Testament, one has the impression of an old tradition\nhanded down through the centuries (cf., e.g, Paul’s Epistle to the\nPhilippians, where the “saints in Christ” are addressed first and the\nbishops and deacons “together” with them). Only the flowery style\nof the introductions, although invariably written in Hebrew, might\nhave been influenced by the Arabic predilection for exuberance.\n\nEveryone, women and children not excluded, was regarded as\nbelonging to the congregation. In accordance with the notions of\ndecency prevailing in those days, women were rarely mentioned ex-\npressly but referred to in such general terms as “the rest of the peo-\nple.” There are, however, letters in which the public spirit of women\n(and girls) is lauded together with, or before, that of the men of a\ncommunity, and as late a Nagid as David 11 Maimonides (around\n\nGoitein, S.

In\nthis respect, too, the solidarity of the qihil was very real, but hardly\nformal. It was expressed in terms of religious injunctions, not of\nconstitutional rights and duties. The law and ethics of religion were\ncomplemented by local custom, which was often referred to in, and\noccasionally reinforced by, written testimonies bearing witness to\nits age-old and general acceptance. From time to time, however,\nthere arose situations that demanded more formal procedures. We\nshall presently see which ways were adopted to meet this need.\n\nLarge, medium-sized, and small communities—By size and func-\ntion, three types of local communities can clearly be discerned. In\nthe capital cities the highest juridical and religious authorities had\ntheir seats and there alone a thorough religious and secular educa-\ntion was available. Everything was decided there. The capital was\nthe country. This was fully so in Egypt, while in Palestine, Ramle,\nthe administrative center, shared certain privileges with Jerusalem,\nthe Holy City. In Tunisia, the seaport al-Mahdiyya stood in a similar\nrelationship to Qayrawin and took over its role entirely after the\nsack of 1057,\n\nSecond in rank were the communities in maritime cities of larger\nsize, such as Alexandria, Damietta, Ascalon, or Tyre, or in inland\ndistrict centers, like al-Mahalla or Minyat Ziftd in the Nile Delta, or\nQiis in Upper Egypt. These centers also partly took care of the com-\nmunities of the third type, located in the numerous smaller places,\nwhich, as a rule, were unable to maintain full panels of religious and\ncommunal officials. The geographical boundaries and administra-\ntive competence of the various district authorities were by no means\nstatic, but, as repeatedly shown in this volume, constantly had to be\nreapportioned and adapted to the personalities in charge and to the\nwiims of public opinion.\n\nThere is no need to deal specifically with the congregations in the\ncapitals and the maritime cities, since the major part of the material\nassembled in this volume refers to them.

Calcula-\ntions of the size of the Jewish community of Fustat during the twelfth\nand thirteenth centuries are provided below (pp. 139 ff). For the gen-\neral population, too, modest figures have been proposed.1s\n\nMinyat Zifti, example of a middle-sized community\n\nAs an example of a middle-sized community in a district center 1\nchoose Minyat Zifta, the smallest of those mentioned above, because\nthe amount of Geniza material referring to that place makes it pos-\nsible to present it in its entirety with reasonable completeness. As to\nthe size of the community in Minyat Zifta, anyone engaged in pop-\nulation estimates of times and places for which we possess only\nhaphazard information is aware of the precariousness of such com-\nputations. Certain conclusions might be drawn from the available\nitems. Only one out of six elders signing a document in Minyat\nZifta, together with the presiding judge, in July, 1156, was identical\nwith one out of five doing the same two years earlier, in July, 1154.\nThe art of writing (as opposed to that of reading) was not common\nin the Middle Ages. The presence of ten persons (none of whom was\na brother of another) able to understand the legal procedures in-\nvolved and to properly sign a document induces us to assume that\nthe community was not too limited in size.® Similarly, a letter ad-\ndressed to the Nagid Abraham Maimonides in December, 1219-\nJanuary, 1220, recommending the appointment (or confirmation) of\nthe son of a former judge, is signed by seven individuals, besides the\nscribe. Since the letter emphasizes that another person in the little\ntown was vehemently opposed to their candidate, it must be assumed\nfor sure that another letter, signed by other elders from Minyat\nZifta, was sent to the Nagid at approximately the same time.l7\nFinally, on a statement about contributions to a public appeal writ-\nten in summer, 1266, when the community had already much de-\nclined, seven signatures and traces of at least two others are visible.18\n\nAnother indication of the size of the community in Minyat Zifta\nmay be abstracted from the following: When the Jewish authorities\nin the capital once sent a scholar to the provincial center to summon\nits judge Shabbetay b. Abraham (dated documents: March, 1135,\nthrough May, 1178 %), he found the town ravaged by a plague; all\nthe members of the judge’s family, twelve or thirteen persons, were\ndangerously ill; every week there were ten to twelve cases of mourn-\ning in the congregation, and it was hardly possible to find the requi-\nsite ten males able to perform the burial rites.?

A namesake of Abraham b. Shabbetay, who\nalso had a Palestinian hand and wrote and signed a marriage con-\ntract in Fustat in 1063, might very well have been the grandfather of\nour judge.

There, too, a rival muqaddam was more popular than our\nwriter, with the effect that the new appointment brought to the com-\nplainant more trouble and waste of time than income. He requested\ntherefore, that Minyat Zifta be restored to him in full, and that he\nwould like to retain also a third townlet, Malij, for which he had\nheld letters of appointment for years. The writer emphasized that he\nwas a man with few relatives and only weak supporters. The Nagid\nwas his protector, but needed to be reminded from time to time of\nthe unsatisfactory situation.5s\n\nThe final eclipse of Minyat Zifti is evident from a number of docu-\nments that prove that a professional judge no longer stood at the\nhead of the community. One letter reveals that a perfumer, with a\ngood hand in both Hebrew and Arabic, had taken his place, another\nthat a physician, who wanted also to replace a schoolteacher who had\ntemporarily been forced to leave the town, had done 50.5¢ The latter\nincident is a particular sign of decline, since earlier the town had\nboasted of a full staff of juridical, religious, and educational person-\nnel. A report on the excommunication of a defaulting debtor in\nMinyat Zifta by a visiting judge or the imposition of a “conditional\nban” on another debtor by “the community” as such also shows that\na scholarly spiritual leader was no longer in the town.5?

This ambiguity was unavoidable be-\ncause the Hebrew and Arabic terms used in our sources have both\nmeanings. In this fact is reflected a reality to be faced in the Geniza\nrecords during the entire period.\n\nAs explained, there existed in most larger towns two synagogues, a\n“Palestinian” and a “Babylonian.” Originally, these congregations\nhad been formed mainly by persons coming from the countries of the\nformer Byzantine empire on the one hand and those from the land\nof the Eastern caliphate on the other. By the time of the High Middle\nAges, however, adherence to one of the two rites had become largely\na matter of personal taste and decision with the result that the two\nsynagogues had to compete with each other for new members. The\nGeniza reveals to us in detail how this was done. The Iraqis with their\ncenturies-old experience of soliciting funds for their renowned seats\nof learning had the Gaons of Baghdad shower extravagant honorary\ntitles on the many foreigners who flocked to the capital of Egypt\nfrom the four corners of the earth.”™ The Palestinians, albeit reluct-\nantly, followed suit, but also had other feathers in their cap. They\nboasted of having the most precious Bible codices (some of which are\nstill preserved in libraries), as well as magnificent Torah scrolls and\nbeautiful sitting carpets. In addition, they pointed out that for vari-\nous reasons their service was more attractive, since their Scripture\nreadings were so much shorter than those of the Babylonians and\nwere chanted by boys, so that parents who were eager to have their\nchildren participate actively in the service would certainly prefer the\ncongregation of the Palestinians. On the other hand, the Babylonians\ntried to impart splendor to their service by entrusting the Scripture\nreadings to excellent cantors.?®\n\nBy the end of the twelfth century, the Babylonian rite (that of the\n“Diaspora”) had been accepted almost everywhere. When Moses\nMaimonides became established in Egypt, he tried, for the sake of\nunity, to abolish the peculiarities of the Palestinians altogether, He\nwas not successful, though; on the contrary, at the time of his son\nand successor Abraham the specific customs of the Palestinian syna-\ngogue of Old Cairo were reconfirmed by a solemn pact.”\n\nIt is natural that such competition would sometimes lead to [fric-\ntion among the leaders of the respective congregations or even among\nits members. “We, the two congregations [the text says: synagogues]\nhave come together and united and made peace between ourselves,”\nsays an old, but unfortunately much damaged fragment, which at\n\nGoitein, S.

This is expressed\nfirst in the astonishing fact that the public chest was administered in\ncommon. As a rule, donations were made and fines stipulated or im-\nposed for the benefit of the two synagogues in equal shares. “The\nRabbanites living in Misr [Fustat]” were addressed by “Their breth-\nren, the Rabbanites living in Ramle,” in this way, although there\nwere Palestinian and Iragian synagogues in both cities and the mat-\nters discussed concerned religious ritual.8\n\nObjects such as books, Torah scrolls, lamps, carpets, and other\nprecious textiles were donated to the individual synagogues, but the\nfar larger gifts destined for the social services (including the emolu-\nments of community officials) were pooled for the benefit of the local\ncommunity as a whole. Many accounts show that current expenditure\nwas made for the two synagogues together and often by one and the\nsame official. Property dedicated to charitable purposes was described\nas forming a part of the gédesh (“the holy,” see below), in Arabic\nahbas al-Yahiid, both meaning “Jewish pious foundations.”8! Even\nwhen the individual synagogue buildings were affected, as with the\nrenovations undertaken after the demolition at the time of the caliph\nal-Hakim, a united appeal was made and the funds collected were\ndistributed in equal shares.82\n\nThis cooperation was not entirely confined to the Rabbanite com-\nmunity.

The differences in\nritual still gave occasion to bickerings, but these are recorded as ex-\nceptional cases.9?\n\nOn the other hand, the eleventh century was fraught with emer-\ngencies calling for concerted action. It began with the demolition of\nthe houses of worship under al-Hikim, There followed a long series\nof calamities that affected the country as a whole, while the minority\ngroups were, as usual, no less hard hit. The Muslim sources have\nmuch to tell us about civil war, famine, and the breakdown of public\norder, resulting even in the pillage of the caliph’s palaces. The lists\nof synagogue furnishings from this period suffice to testify that the\nhouses of worship were not spared. In addition, we have direct testi-\nmony to the same effect. “I am unable to describe how I and my\nfriends were afflicted when we heard what happened to the synagogue\nof the Palestinians,” writes a merchant from Alexandria to a business\nfriend in Old Cairo around 1070.23 Events outside Egypt also re-\nquired the utmost exertion for the common good.

At his appointment\nthe community granted him obedience, but it was never forgotten\nthat he was its “servant.”\n\nA few examples illustrate this blending of hierocratic and demo-\ncratic elements in Jewish community life. One of the most prominent\nJewish judges in Old Cairo during the twelfth century, although re-\nappointed by a new Nagid, described his situation to a colleague in\nDamascus as foliows: “By the grace of God, the holy congregations\nlove me and are pleased with my service and show me great favor.\nPraise be to the Almighty who let me find favor in their eyes so that\nthey put me into office. My Nagid also likes me and bestows favors on\nme.” Clearly, acceptance by the community was vital to this man at\nleast as much as the approval of the Nagid.** The influential role of\nthe laity in the selection of a Gaon has been pointed out above (p. 16).\n\nIn reply to a complaint by the Palestinian congregation of Alex-\nandria about their chief judge, whose father and grandfather had\npreceded him in office, Solomon b. Judah, the Gaon of Jerusalem,\nemphasizes that he would by no means force them to retain him: “He\nis your son and it is from you that he derives his livelihood.”? This\nletter, written in Arabic, is the more remarkable as it was followed\nby another letter in Hebrew, where the Gaon reiterates that the\nyeshiva would never appoint any one against the will of the congre-\ngation, but that, to the best of his knowledge, the disputed official\nhad the confidence of the majority, which regarded him as a better\nscholar than even his father (who was then still alive and had recom-\nmended him).%¢ As a matter of fact, the man retained his post for\ndecades after his father's death, albeit not without opposition, ac-\ncording to various other Geniza documents relevant to him.\n\nOnce, when the synagogue building in Hebron, Palestine, had to\nbe replaced by another, perhaps because an earthquake had made it\nunsafe, the executive had the following to report: “As soon as that\npiece of land had been bought, all agreed to pull the synagogue down\nand to erect a new one.

They were common even with regard to\ncases of civil law involving only a few persons. The custom of address-\ning letters dealing with such cases to the community as a whole was\nnot merely a matter of courtesy. They were actually read out in pub-\nlic, as we learn both from requests made to the effect and from reports\nthat it had been done.® It is also characteristic that sometimes letters\nwere thus divulged which by their very nature were confidential (like\nthe opinion of a higher authority about a community servant), or,\nquite the opposite, were withheld from the assembly against its\nwish,9?\n\nWe have to keep in mind that in those days the population of a\ntown was comparatively small and the local Jewish communities were\neven smaller. The full participation of all members in the discussion\nof public affairs did not present technical difficulties; on the con-\ntrary, it was natural.

Just as we find elders\nactive in Fustat and Damietta, Egypt, in Ramle and Baniyas, Pales-\ntine, or Qayrawan and Zawilat al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, so do we find\nthem at the same time and in the same capacity in the communities\nof Speyer, Worms, Mayence, and Cologne, Germany.\n\nThe duties of the elders are well defined in the statute just alluded\nto, in which it was resolved that a board of ten elders should assist\nEphraim b. Shemarya, head of the community in Old Cairo, as fol-\nlows: (a) sit with him as judges of the court; (b) share with him the\nburden of all the needs of the community; (¢) support him in the en-\nforcement of religious duties; (d) help him protect public morality;\n(e} deal appropriately with those who live in a way disapproved by\nreligion; (f) consider the letters addressed by the heads of the academy\nto the community and answer them after deliberation in the general\nassembly.103\n\nThe number ten has some significance in Jewish law, for a mini-\nmum of ten persons was required for a service to be regarded as com-\nmunal; it constituted a public body.

In the second decade of the eleventh\ncentury, the Ephraim mentioned earlier headed a board of seven; in\nthe third decade, we find documents signed by that number, and the\nsame holds true of an important statute written in 1205. “The seven\nbest men of the town” was the standing designation for a municipal\nor congregational council in talmudic and later Hebrew literature,\nand this might have had some influence on the formation of boards\nof seven.!'0 In a responsum, Maimonides states expressly that the\nnumber was not compulsory. A committee of three led the two Jewish\ncongregations of Alexandria after the death of their chief rabbi and\nbefore the election of another. Three is the number of judges re-\nquired by a Jewish court and suggested itself as the minimum num-\nber of members for a communal committee during a period of\ntransition.11?\n\nOccasionally, we find councils of elders of considerable size. An\neleventh-century Gaon of Jerusalem appoints, or approves the elec-\ntion of, sixteen elders, each mentioned by name (the list includes\ngroups of three and two brothers, respectively).

Special prayers were said for their well-being\non the High Holidays, as for the ecumenical Jewish authorities.\nWhen the list of eulogized elders contained names not favored by the\ncommunity, the latter would not fail to express its dissatisfaction.1\n\nFrom these elders, who were honorary officials designated by the\nHebrew term ziqén (“‘old man,” as Greek presbyter), are to be dis-\ncerned the notables, sometimes informally called “noted elders,” al-\nshuyiitkh al-mash-hiirin, or outrightly by the modern Arabic term\nzu ‘amd’, “leaders.”118 The latter formed the upper layer of the Jewish\n(and Muslim or Christian) middle class and probably had the last\nword in selecting community officials and in other decisions affecting\nthe community.!'? Not everyone, however, belonging to this class\nacted as an “elder,” and the official elders, it seems, were not always\nrich or influential.\n\nThese notables often acted as de facto representatives of the com-\nmunity with the central or local governments, using their influence\nfor seeking redress of iniquities or for obtaining special favors. Many\nGeniza papers illustrate this situation (which was not confined to the\nMuslim world and the Middle Ages, as some historians seem to be-\nlieve), and numerous examples are provided throughout this book.\nAs a typical instance, the long letter of the community in Palermo to\nthe one in al-Mahdiyya, repeatedly referred to before, may be sum-\nmarized here.

Another time, the Muslim authorities\nwished to appropriate large sections of the Christian and Jewish\ncemeteries for some building projects. Again, it was Khalaf who\naverted this disaster from befalling the Jews, while the Christians had\nto ransom theirs with heavy payments. Finally, some large-scale liti-\ngation between coreligionists, which became a menace when brought\nbefore the Muslim courts, was settled through the good services of the\nforeigner. All this was done by him, as the letter emphasizes, without\nany material benefit accruing to himself and without charging any-\none in the community a penny. Still, the letter (whose concluding\npart is mostly lost) must have had some practical purpose. Perhaps\nKhalaf wanted to open a warehouse for foreign merchants in al-\nMahdiyya. We find him, indeed, in that city in and around 1030,\nacting as the representative of the great Ibn ‘Awkal of Old Cairo. Be\nthat as it may, Khalaf b. Jacob illustrates well the role of these self-\nappointed representatives (or “redeemers and faithful shepherds,” as\nthe letter calls them) of a much-harrassed minority group.!2°\n\nAge groups, social classes, and factions.—The word for “old man”\nr “elder,” in addition to the two meanings discussed, had in both\nArabic and Hebrew a third and rather general sense, namely, that of\na respectable person. Thus, one would speak of the elder Flasan, Mr.\nJapheth, the young man (Japheth was regarded as the Hebrew equi-\nvalent of Hasan, both meaning “handsome”) ; or a person would be\ncharacterized as “the elder, the young man” (al-shaykh ha-bahiir).12!\nSimilarly, the term “the young men,” bahiirim in Hebrew and sibyan\nin Arabic, designated both an age group and a social class, although\nit was used more frequently in the former sense. One should beware\nof assigning too low an age to the top limit of the “age group” thus\nreferred to. A merchant, who had traveled to both Sicily and India,\nor a silk worker, who had been married twice, could still belong to\nthe “young men,” and one letter even speaks of “sibyin from\nAleppo, young and old.” 2 We have already seen that in letters to a\ncommunity greetings would be extended to the “young men” as a\nseparate group,!23\nThese “young men” were active in community life. When a con-\ngregation in Old Cairo was once divided with regard to a guest\ncantor from Ramle, Palestine, whom the elders of that city had\nbanned, the youth supported him, and, to make things worse, “many\nsided with the bahiirim, for this generation is very corrupt, as it is\nwritten: The lad will behave insolently against the aged [Isaiah 3:5].”\n\nGoitein, S.

The people opposed to the elders he\ndesignates as “the public,” “the community [al-jama‘a]” or simply\n“the Jews.” 136 The Jewish oyster-gatherers of Alexandria are de-\nscribed in a Geniza letter as people of low standing; later, in Mamluk\ntimes, the Muslim fisherfolk of Alexandria, when severely oppressed,\ntook the law into their own hands, lynching the governor of the city\nand his deputy.13!

Even in a small town, there\nwould often be found a scholar equaling the appointed community\nleader in learning and religious authority or even outshining him.\nIf he also possessed enough ambition and stamina, there would soon\nrally around him a faction demanding his appointment, and com-\nmunal strife became inevitable.\n\nLocal dissensions were often intertwined with contests for ecu-\nmenical or territorial leadership. Rival Gaons or Nagids would seek\nfollowers and supporters in each and every town and congregation,\ngiving would-be local leaders and troublemakers an excellent oppor-\ntunity to try their fortune. Moreover, factions were formed by per-\nsons hailing from the same town or country who had settled in\nforeign parts. Because of the mobility of Mediterranean society in\nthe High Middle Ages, this was an extremely common phenomenon.\n\nModern Jewish scholars who have dealt with these “dissensions”\nhave been somewhat uneasy and unhappy about them. We should\nthink of them rather as party politics inherent in any essentially\ndemocratic society. The modern Arabic word for political party,\nhizb, is already in use in the Geniza records to designate a faction,\nand the verb derived from it means “organizing, or forming, a\nparty.” 13 The term ‘asabiyya, esprit de corps, dedicated following\nthe central idea of 1bn Khaldiin's philosophy of history (written in\n1377), appears in our papers in the same sense. The following pas-\nsage, written by the brother of the Davidite Daniel b. Azarya, who\nhad obtained the gaonate of Jerusalem in 1051 after much strife, is\ncharacteristic: “You mentioned that a settlement was reached be-\ntween ‘Allan [the havér who was head of the Palestinians in Old\nCairo] and my brother, the rayyis. 1 was happy about this, not for\nthe just mentioned, the havér, but for my brother, because by fight-\ning against him, he [‘Alliin] attains publicity [the text says: “a mar-\nket”] and creates for himself a following (‘asabiyya).”” 137 Just as in\nmodern election campaigns politicians hurl the most objectionable\ninvectives against each other without taking them too much to heart\nafter the polls have made their decision, so in the Geniza records at\nthe time of dissension, mahldgeth, the language used is strong, but\nas soon as peace, shaldm, is restored, the same persons become ex-\ntremely polite and deferential to one another.

The Talmud already discusses the problem of to what extent\nforeigners were obliged to share the financial burden of the local\npeople. In the Geniza papers, it seems to relate mainly to the obliga-\ntion to contribute to the jaliya, or poll tax, incumbent on indigent\npersons. Since the foreigners had already paid at home (otherwise\nthey would not have been allowed to travel), it was reasonable not\nto trouble them with the local jaliya at all. There were circumstances,\nhowever, that induced some congregations to deviate from this rule.\nThe Jewish (and also, it seems, the Muslim) population of the main\nport of Egypt, Alexandria, included many poor. Attempts were there-\nfore made to have the foreigners share the welfare burden. A letter\nfrom one Sicilian merchant to another regrets that the addressee was\nsqueezed dry, although “foreigners normally pay nothing or little.”\nAnother very long letter from Alexandria written by a Maghrebi is\ndevoted wholly to this matter, but unfortunately not clear to us in its\nentirety. A delegation of thirty-five foreigners, headed by the writer,\nhad approached the qadi and made a certain contribution in order to\navoid further molestation. After a second complaint to the qadi, the\nlocal community took new measures. They reduced payments sched-\nuled to be paid by the foreigners to one-half with a view to forcing\nthem to contribute, and spread disparaging rumors against the leader\nof the Maghrebis. Since practically everyone coming from the West\narrived in Alexandria, the matter was important enough for the\npromulgation of a ban by the Gaon of Jerusalem on anyone “hurting\nforeigners” by impelling them to make contributions not incumbent\non them or by otherwise wronging them. A letter from Sicily urges\nJudah b. Moses Ibn Sighmar, the representative of the Maghrebis in\nEgypt, to work for the implementation of that ban, so that both old-\ntimers originating from the Maghreb and newcomers could live\npeacefully in the land of the Nile.148\n\nAnother question that cropped up was the protection of inhabi-\ntants [rom economic competition by newcomers. The steps taken in\nthe interest of local craftsmen against the competition of aliens are\ndiscussed in Med. Soc. 1, 85. A letter by the judge Shabbetay b. Abra-\nham of Minyat Zifta vividly illustrates similar efforts with regard to\ncommercial rivalry. An outsider from Cairo with two partners had\nopened a store of medical potions, thereby doing harm to “the Jews,”\nthat is, to the local community (as the letter emphasizes four times,\n\nGoitein, S.

The\nlocal community was unable to tackle the situation, particularly since\na son of its leader was involved. The judge reports that he ap-\nproached the chief of police, the gadi, and the “elders” (meaning\nprobably the Muslim notables) and now asks two prominent men in\nCairo directly to take up the matter with the person concerned.}?\n‘When a rich man from Sfax, Tunisia, settled in Mazara, Sicily,\naround 1064, bought there a house for himself for 800 dinars and sent\nfor his wife to join him (definite proof that he intended to stay in the\nisland), the local Jews, who dreaded his competition, informed the\nNorman ruler of the arrival of the undesirable newcomer.150\n\nStill, nothing has been found thus far in the Geniza papers com-\nparable with an institution developed among European Jews and\nrightly explained by the students of history as fitting into the general\nstructure of feudal society: the so-called herem ha-yishiiv, the denial\nof admission to any newcomer, except with special permission.15! It\nis not only the silence of the Geniza records in this respect which is\ninstructive. We have a very interesting letter indicating that the in-\nstitution was foreign to the Mediterranean world. In this letter, a\nscholar strongly dissuades another from traveling to a country that\nwould take “three years” to reach. (In The Arabian Nights, too, it\ntakes over two years to get to a distant place.) Against the expecta-\ntions of the addressee, the Jewish scholars there were of no greater\nerudition than a local scholar quoted by name. On the other hand,\nthe language and manners there were foreign and barbarous and the\nJews did not permit a coreligionist from abroad to stay longer than\none month if he was engaged in business. The reference to scholars\nand the refusal of admission points to Germany as the country al-\nIuded to.152\n\nIn general, then, we see that statutes and formal enactments of a\npublic body, although not frequently found in the Geniza, were by\nno means unknown.

Nevertheless, the Geniza contains sufficient material to\nenable us to gain clarity about this matter.\n\nThe term “muqaddam” had been well known from Spanish Jewish\nhistory. When it made its appearance in the Geniza documents as\nwell, a connection was naturally sought between the two. As late as\n1950 it was suggested that the institution was brought to the East by\nSpanish Jews.? In reality, the office of the muqaddam was well estab-\nlished in Egypt by the end of the eleventh century, whereas in Spain\nmugaddams are mentioned frequently only during the thirteenth\nand fourteenth centuries. In Spain they appear regularly in the\nplural as elders forming boards consisting of four to twenty-five\nmembers and representing the local communities. Thus, no direct\nconnection should be assumed between these two institutions.?\n\nIn order to arrive at a correct understanding of the term “muqad-\ndam” as it was used in the East during the Geniza period, we have\nto keep in mind (a) that it appears there both in the specific sense\ndefined above and in the general meaning of “leader,” and (b) that\nthe post of appointed executive could be held by persons of different\nprofessions, such as a havér, or member of the Jerusalem academy, a\njudge, a cantor, a scribe, or even a layman with some Jewish learning.\nConsequently, we find persons styled mugaddam who did not hold\nthe position of an appointed community leader at all, while on the\nother hand others who did occupy it were identified by their profes-\nsion or by another characteristic. In other cases, both the profession\nand the position were indicated; for example, the sender of a mag-\nnificently written letter from the townlet of Malij signs thus: “The\nhavér, muqaddam of Malij.”# Since this fluent terminology has led\nto a certain confusion, some details are given to explain the situation.\n\nWhen the Spanish Jewish poet Judah ha-Levi, on the way to the\nHoly Land, passed some months in Alexandria in fall, 1140, and\nspring, 1141, he was called by the Muslims there “muqaddam of the\nJews,” although he did not, of course, hold any official position.5 In\na contract dated 1099, a beadle is threatened with immediate dis-\nmissal if he showed lack of respect against the members of the con-\ngregation or the mugaddams, meaning here anyone holding an\noffice in the synagogue. Maimonides uses the word in the same sense.8\nThe verb tagaddam, “to be appointed as head,” simply could mean\n“to lead a congregation in prayer,” said of an honored guest or of\ncommunity officials taking up this duty in turn.”\n\nOn the other hand, even in our oldest documents we find the verb\n\nGoitein, S.

It may be that the Arabic title adopted this specific meaning\nin the last third of the eleventh century for the same reason that gave\nrise to the office of Nagid: the eclipse of the gaonate of Palestine and\nwith it the necessity to regulate the communal service on a territorial\nbasis. Licensing by the Nagid's representatives, the Jewish chief\njudges in the Egyptian capital, gradually replaced the diploma of the\nyeshiva,\n\nMost of the judges and other muqaddams whose origin is referred\nto in our sources were foreigners or at least not natives of the town\nor district where they served. Palestine and Iraq, northwest Africa\nand Spain, Byzantium, and later also France provided most of the\nspiritual and communal leaders. This fact was perhaps due to the\npreference of the Egyptian Jews for more practical ways of life (a\ntendency that seems to have prevailed until modern times). When\nwe find in smaller towns mostly outsiders as muqaddams, there was\nperhaps, in addition, a definite policy at work which intended to\nkeep the appointee as far as possible independent of the local coter-\nies. Many of our records refer to muqaddams new in the town, and\nin one letter the local people do not want him also as teacher, because\nthey did not regard him as a permanent resident.13\n\nGoitein, S.

It concerns Ephraim b. Shemarya, the head of the Palestinians\nand, during extended periods, of the Rabbanites at large, in Old\nCairo. It is dated July, 1028, and represents the renewal of a long-\nstanding allegiance. At that time, of course, public officials were\nappointed by the Great Sanhedrin (as the yeshiva of Jerusalem was\ncalled) through its presidents, the Gaons. Accordingly, the document,\nafter having stated the desires of the community to comply with the\ncommandments of God who had chosen Jerusalem (quoting Deuter-\nonomy 17:8-10) and to follow the traditions of the Jewish faith,\nmakes mention of the fact that Ephraim had been appointed by three\nsuccessive Gaons to serve as judge, community leader, and religious\nauthority, and given the title havér, or member of the academy, by\neach of thern. The new Gaon (Solomon b. Judah) had renewed all\nthese prerogatives and Ephraim had displayed under him the same\npraiseworthy conduct and dedication as under his predecessors.\nTherefore, the community saw fit to accept his leadership in the fu-\nture also and to obey him, as described by the law (quoting Deuter-\nonomy 16:18).14\n\nIn the document just discussed, the allegiance of the local com-\nmunity was expressed long after the central authority had made the\nappointment. The opposite procedure can be observed in another\ndocument, written exactly two hundred years later (1228 or about\nthat date). Anatoli of Marseille, the Jewish chief judge of Alexandria,\nhad died, and the local congregations had agreed on the election of\nanother French rabbi, who had already served them as acting judge\nfor three years. Now a notable in Old Cairo is requested to secure the\napproval of the Nagid. Incidentally, in many documents the head of\nthe Alexandrian Jewish community is referred to as muqaddam.!s\n\nA muqaddam over a city or an entire district needed a written\ncertificate by the local governor or the caliph himself confirming his\nappointment. A man who had been transferred by the yeshiva from\nLgypt to a district in northern Syria (which comprised towns as dis-\ntant {from cach other as Baalbek in present-day Lebanon and Raqqa\ncast of the Euphrates) recounts that he had already seen the local\ngovernor four times and had been exceedingly well received by him,\nbut had not yet taken from him the certificate of installment because\nhe did not cherish the new place and was not sure whether he would\nremain.

Judah). Joseph was\nto continue as the highest Jewish authority in the city with regard to\ncases of civil law, marriage and divorce, religious ritual, and appoint-\nment or dismissal of cantors (presumably also other communal of-\nficials; there is a gap in the manuscript); no one had the right to\nchange his decisions except the Gaon who had appointed him. The\nArabic script and style of the petition are identical with those of the\ndocument aimed at obtaining a letter of installment or confirmation\nfor a Gaon (see sec. A, 1, n. 38, above). Both must have been written\nin 1036, when al-Mustansir became caliph, the only change of gov-\nernment during the incumbency of Solomon b. Judah.16\n\nJust as there was no rigid procedure at the appointment of a\nmuqaddam so did his duties and prerogatives depend largely on local\nconditions and on his own qualities and qualifications. We have\nnoticed this in the complaint of the muqaddam of Minyat Zifta. Still,\na common pattern emerges from our variegated records.

He would\nalso normally lead the congregation in prayer, but, unless he was a\nprofessional cantor, would leave most of the chanting and singing to\nothers. The liturgy was still fluid at that time, and he would make\ndecisions in this matter as well or ask a higher authority for guid-\nance.!® In addition, he would also serve as one of the local scribes,\ndraw up legal documents, and write official letters. The handwriting\nof many a muqaddam is known to us, since much of the fruit of their\nlabors has been preserved.\n\nFrom these letters regarding al-Mahalla, as well as other similar\nones, it is evident that the mugaddam was empowered to make uni-\nlateral decisions solely in cases of religious law and ritual, where he\nwas supposed to interpret the sacred writings authoritatively.

In the smaller towns of the Rif, where\nmuqaddams were chosen because of a strong personzlity and the\nability to restrain the unruly rather than for scholarship, their reli-\ngious authority too was occasionally challenged. “This muqaddam,”\nwrites a scholarly schoolmaster from a small town to his friend in Old\nCairo, “is not good enough to be an inferior, let alone a superior” and\nthen goes on to give examples of the latter’s mismanagement of the\nreligious law (both, by the way, were Palestinians).’® A muqaddam of\nHebron, Palestine, complains to the judge of Old Cairo who had ap-\npointed him that he was not always obeyed even in matters pertain-\ning to religion. About a similar grievance we shall read presently.20\n\nA mugaddam had also to be a good fund-raiser, since communal\nrevenue consisted to a large extent of voluntary contributions. A\nphysician who was also a muqaddam assured his friend that he\nwould not extort money from him, although both his vocation and\navocation had trained him in this art.?! Another substantial, and\ncertainly not always pleasant, duty was the assistance of government\nofficials or tax-farmers in the assessment of the poll tax incumbent on\nthe members of the congregation. On the other hand, such a task was\nliable to strengthen the assessor’s position.\n\nThe emoluments of the muqaddam are better treated together\nwith those of other communal officials, since they differed from those\nof others in quantity rather than in nature, but were as varied. We\nfrequently read that muqaddams (and others) leave their posts in a\nsmaller town or rural district because they were not paid sufficiently\nor were not paid at all. Sometimes the parting official speaks about\nhis parish in friendly and even loving terms, certainly because he\nrealized that poverty rather than bad will was the source of their\ndefault.

In an enormous letter issued by the two judges of\nthe capital in the name of the Nagid Mevorakh, a circuit judge is\nstrongly rebuked for having given judgment in a town in the absence\nof the local muqaddam and for having taken other actions without\nconsulting him (and the elders).2’> When a community leader, upon\nreturning from a trip to the capital, found that the son of a scholar\nhad married four couples, writing their marriage contracts and per-\nforming the weddings, he respectfully asks the chief judge to send him\na letter explaining whether or not the action of the scholar’s son was\npermissible—a polite form of announcing that something very im-\nproper had been done.2¢ It is well known that Maimonides and his\ncourt published in January, 1187, a solemn prohibition against any-\none, except the muqaddam, performing a wedding in specified pro-\nvincial towns.

This is the essence of a religious office, all the rest is in-\ncidental.”3!\n\nThe head of the congregation(s).—\"Muqaddam,” as we have seen,\nwas the name of an office, not a title. Therefore, it is found only ex-\nceptionally as a family name and is never attached to the name of a\nperson’s father.32 The opposite was the case with the “head of the\ncongregation” or “congregations,” rosh ha-qahal or ha-qehillot. It is\nextremely common as a title of honor following the name of a per-\nson’s father or that of a person addressed in a letter or mentioned in\na document, but we hear next to nothing about the activities specific\nto a person styled in this way.?3\n\nClearly, at various times and in different places the title was given\nto holders of diverse positions in the community. In a letter sent to\nManbij, far up in northern Syria, a scholar is addressed as “rosh\nha-gihal,” but in the address, which is written in Arabic letters, he is\ncalled “the tax-farmer of the market and judge of the Jews.”3t Three\ncases of heads of congregations being or becoming judges have been\nnoted for the eleventh century in Old Cairo.3®> When Maimonides\nmentions in one of his responsa that the congregations used to rise\nand remain standing while the head of the academy or the head of\nthe congregation was reciting the Holy Scriptures, he was certainly\nusing the term “head of the congregation” to mean a scholar ap-\npointed as community leader.3¢\n\nOn the other hand, there are many instances where the rosh ha-\n\nGoitein, S.

In an old letter\nwritten on parchment, sent from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, to the havéer\nEphraim (of Old Cairo) a message is given to a head of the congrega-\ntions there. The same appellation is found in an approximately con-\ntemporary letter addressed to the president of the Jewish court in\nAleppo, Syria.37 Around 1100, a document is signed in a little town\nby a résh ha-qahal together with the appointed judge, and the con-\ntents of the document clearly indicate that the judge, and not the\nrosh ha-qahal, was in charge of the communal affairs. In addition,\nthe shaky, awkward handwriting of the rosh ha-qahal betrays an un-\ntutored person.?8 With few exceptions, most of the heads of congrega-\ntions appearing in the Geniza records after 1050 are known to us only\nby name.\n\nWith some hesitation, a sketch of the historical development of\nthis common term is attempted here. It is highly probable that the\nhead of the congregation of the Geniza period replaced the ancient\nhead of the synagogue (rosh ha-keneset, Greek archi-synagogos), for\nthe latter term is entirely absent from our records. As evident from\nthe Talmud, the head of the synagogue was a layman inferior in rank\nto the scholar appointed as community leader, and indeed to any\nscholar.3® In the Hebrew papyruses, the old title was still in full use,10\nbut by the tenth century it had become obsolete, perhaps because it\ncarried with it the connotation of laity, which was shunned in a\nperiod when everyone wanted to be regarded as a religious scholar.\nThe new title was neutral and, as shown by the examples given above,\ncould be borne by both judges and laymen. In the tenth and early\neleventh centuries the term seems to have designated presidents of\nthe congregations, for we find persons so styled mentioned in memo-\nrial lists together with Gaons and judges or using this title regularly\nafter their signatures.‘! In Yemen and North Africa, the diocesan\nrepresentative of the yeshivas was designated as head of the congre-\ngations.42\n\nDuring the same period, however, it had become customary that\nonly a scholar qualifying as member of the yeshiva could lead a large\ncongregation, while toward the end of the eleventh century, we find\nthat only a mugaddam, or appointee of the Nagid or his representa-\ntives, could fill this post. We never hear of a clash (or an act of co-\noperation) between a muqaddam and a résh ha-qahal. Thus, it would\nbe out of place to regard the latter as a representative of the local\npeople as opposed to the scholarly executive. We have also to keep in\nmind that no Arabic equivalent exists for this term.13 It therefore\nseems that by the end of the eleventh century the title of head of the\n\nGoitein, S. D.

No express mention of this aspect has\nbeen found thus far. Only in small places that had no muqaddam\ndoes the head of the congregation appear as the man in charge of the\ncommunity.4*\n\nWe sporadically find other terms referring to leaders of congrega-\ntions or local communities. In 1240, the gayyim, or superintendent\nof the “small synagogue™ in Alexandria, possessed a house in Cairo,\nand, rather strangely, also seems to have lived there. Qayyim is a\nMuslim title referring to the administration of a mosque or other re-\nligious institution and was in later times transferred to that of a\nsynagogue.*® A person called shaykh al-yahiid, elder (i.e., head) of the\nJews of Ascalon, Palestine, is mentioned early in the twelith century,\nand a letter from Qus in Upper Egypt, written about a hundred\nyears later, speaks somewhat derisively of a perfumer “who says of\nhimself that he is shaykh alyahiid.” By the fourteenth century the\nterm designated the head of the community in Old Cairo who was\nresponsible to the government {or the payment of the poll tax.4¢\n\nAllin all, it seems that despite the prominent role of the elders and\nthe plenary assembly in the conduct of the affairs of the community,\nthe need was not felt to have a formally elected president as a counter-\nweight against the appointed executive.

The very fact that the Hebrew term\nis often rendered in an Arabicized form (firnds, pl. faranisa) illus-\ntrates the popularity of that office.4” The parnds of the Geniza period\ndiffers very much from his successor in European Jewry. He was not\n“a leader” or a president of a congregation, but an official of lower\nrank who served mostly in an honorary capacity, but who sometimes\nwas in receipt of emoluments. As revealed by the greetings extended\nin official letters to various groups of the community, the social service\nofficers were ranked after the scholars, elders, notables, and cantors.\nA combination such as “the parnas, the beadle” sounds strange to\nanyone familiar with the regular Hebrew usage, but occurs in the\n\nGoitein, S.

When Benjamin of Tudela visited “the Synagogue\nof Moses,” the holy shrine of Dammiih on the southwestern outskirts\nof Fustat, he found it under the care of a scholarly old man whom he\ndescribes as “parnas and beadle,” presumably an expression he had\nlearned on his travels.*8\n\nThe field of social services was the one in which respectable mem-\nbers of the community who did not excel in scholarship found rich\nopportunity for making their contribution to the common good. We\nfind well-to-do and influential persons serving as parnasim. Through\na happy coincidence, the Geniza has preserved dozens of letters and\nlegal deeds relating to two parnisim, one called Eli ha-Kohen b.\nYahya (or Hayyim or Hiyya, all having the connotation “Life”), in\nArabic ‘Alliin b. Ya‘ish (which means “May he live”), and one ‘Ulla\nha-Levi b. Joseph, in Arabic $a‘id b. Munajja (the Arabic was sup-\nposed to render the meaning of the Hebrew names) of Damascus,\nboth living in Old Cairo in the same period. Of the former we have\ndocuments dated from 1057 through 1107 and of the latter from 1084\nthrough 1117. Both were assistant members of the rabbinical court\nand as such signed many records. They were also trustees of the court\n(see below), and in this capacity too wrote and signed entries in the\nrecord books. ‘Ulla was active in the Mediterranean as well as in the\nIndia trade and a wide variety of merchandise was handled by him\nas shown in his correspondence. He dealt chiefly in silk, corals, glass,\nbrocade and other robes, and such Western goods as saffron, amber-\ngris, and scammony, and oriental products, in particular brazilwood.\nIn addition to his manifold duties as parnas, he was also a trustee of\nthe yeshiva of Jerusalem. His colleague Eli held a position of confi-\ndence both with the yeshiva and the Nagids Judah and Mevérakh\nand for some time also with the latter's bitter opponent, the exilarch\nDavid b. Daniel. The numerous letters addressed to him from Jerusa-\nlem, Ramle, and Ascalon show him as a rallying point for the Pales-\ntinians, while he was also closely connected with the Tunisians who\nhad emigrated to Egypt. The two parnasim often acted together; on\none occasion we find them signing a long list of needy persons to\nwhom loaves were to be distributed by the community for the dura-\ntion of a month .\n\nThis short sketch was intended to give an idea of the type of per-\nsons serving as parnasim.

An assertion to the contrary is based on a faulty recon-\nstruction of a damaged text.50\n\nAll our sources point to the fact that in each congregation several\nparnasim were active simultaneously, a circumstance that was in ac-\ncordance with Jewish law which required that no public office in-\nvolving the handling of money should be held by fewer than two\npersons.’! The Palestinians in Old Cairo at one time had seven par-\nnasim, at another “more than four” (including one physician) and\nonce exactly four, but even in a provincial town the judge would be\nassisted by several parnisim.5? In the letters addressed to the Eli\nmentioned a few lines above, greetings are usually extended to two\nor more of his colleagues.53\n\nA certain number of social service officers was required also because\nof the many different tasks incumbent on them (see sec. G, below).\nThe administration and maintenance of the houses belonging to the\ncommunity and the distribution of the revenue gained from them\nwere sufficient to occupy more than one person. Since the parnasim\nwere busy people engaged in gaining their livelihood, they would\ntake turns, one “collector” soliciting contributions one week and an-\nother during the next, and so forth.®* A distinguished visitor, a\nproselyte, or an indigent person from a good family (especially if he\nwas a scholar) was assigned to a certain parnis who was expected to\nlook after him personally. Jews living in a remote village would con-\nfide their affairs to a parnas in Fustat, probably because they had no\naccess to a higher official.® Occasionally, a parnas had to travel in\norder to raise funds, for example, for the ransom of captives, or to\naccompany a scholar for the same purpose.’®\n\nFinally, in a large city like Old Cairo, a number of parnasim, orig-\ninating from different countries, was desirable in order to meet the\nrequirements of its cosmopolitan population. We find there parnasim\nof the Ram (Europeans), of people from Jerusalem, from Damietta\n(most probably after the conquest of that town by the Crusaders in\nNovember, 1219) and even from the island of Crete (from which Jews\nmight have migrated in large numbers after it had fallen to the Vene-\ntians in 1204). One of the chores of the parnasim was the assessment\nof the frequently changing needs of each indigent household, and\nthis of course could be done more easily by a man closely acquainted\nwith the background of the families concerned.5?\n\nThe activities of the various social service officers were normally\ncoordinated by the local judge or muqaddam.

Since\nan institution was not a legal personality, all financial transactions\nhad to be made in the name of the parnisim personally.

Various rea-\nsons account for the difference. The service of the sanctuary of God\nwas regarded as an honored privilege. In a letter of appointment it is\ncompared with the function of the Levites in the Temple of Jerusa-\nlem.%8 From another document we learn that in a small town a pious\ncitizen rented a house and dedicated it as a synagogue on condition\nthat he have the privilege “to clean and to serve it.”’% Similarly, in\nIslam, the work of the farrdsh (lit., the one who spreads the carpets),\nor attendant of the mosque, was often done by a high-standing person\nas an expression of reverence and love of God.7®\n\nFurthermore, as other letters of appointment state, the beadle’s\nduties comprised not only the maintenance of the synagogue prop-\nerty, but also “the service of Israel, both women and men” (synagogue\nof the Palestinians), or the service “of the muqaddams and the other\nmembers of the synagogue” (Babylonians).™ He was the community’s\nfactotum and was indeed called in some places, “‘servant of the com-\nmunity.”? He served as messenger and assistant clerk of the court,\nand, in connection with this task, as attorney, trustee, cashier, and in\nother capacities. Therefore, he had an intimate knowledge of all that\nwas going on in the community. It seems, too, that beadles more\noften than not were rather well-to-do.

The writer, after\nhaving listed various grievances against the beadle of the synagogue\nof the Iraqis in Old Cairo, concludes: “He has not the appearance of\na servant, but that of a rayyis [head].\"™ The position of the sham-\nmish in the Geniza period differed, however, from that described in\nAbrahams’ book, since the office as such was regarded in those days\nwith more respect and the functions of the beadle, in accordance with\nthe wider scope of Jewish community life under Islam, were then\neven more varied.\n\nAt the appointment of a shammash, an inventory of the books,\nscrolls, and furnishings of the synagogue, such as gold and silver orna-\nments, lamps, precious textiles, carpets and mats, was drawn up and\nall items confided to his care. He was responsible for their mainten-\nance and preservation—a task that required in those insecure times\nboth vigilance and resourcefulness. He was also in charge of their\ncleaning and of smaller repairs, for which he submitted monthly ac-\ncounts. In particular, he tended to the appropriate illumination of\nthe place during the night, in order to enable laymen and scholars to\npursue their studies. In one document this appears as his most essen-\ntial duty.?\n\nWe frequently find beadles assisting the social service officers or\ndoing their work. In a letter of appointment, a beadle of the Baby-\nlonians is required to help the parnas Eli, whom we have met before,\nin collecting and distributing loaves of bread to the poor.™ In various\ndocuments beadles collect the rents from houses or other property\nbelonging to the community.™ If he had sufficient means, a beadle\nwould farm out the revenue from pious foundations.™\n\nIn his capacity as messenger of the court, the shammash delivered\nsummons and other communications to the parties and had to be on\nhand during the sessions. In addition, he had to take down the deposi-\ntions and pleas made by the persons appearing in court as they were\nrepeated to him by the presiding judge. In one letter of appointment\nthe beadle is threatened with immediate dismissal if he made any\nchanges in the texts dictated to him;8 but it is doubtful whether this\nfunction was common, for most of the rough copies of court records\nactually found in the Geniza are in the handwriting of scribes and\njudges known to us.

        "text": "84 Officials of the Community v, B,2\n\nians, where perhaps other practices prevailed. In any case, a Geniza\nletter shows that even in a small town a beadle would have a good\nhand—betraying continuous training. Thus we are not astonished to\nfind in a city like al-Mahdiyya a beadle (who was writing letters for\na woman) serving as an accomplished scribe.8t\n\nThe close connection with the courts gave the beadles opportuni-\nties for many different jobs. From a document issued in Cairo in 1094\nwe learn that a shammish who was charged with the delivery of a\nbill of divorce to a woman living in Palestine had retained it for three\nyears; as he explained in court, he had always delayed in that way in\norder to give the couple opportunity to be reconciled (a rather high-\nhanded way of forcing happiness upon others).82 In 1098, a husband\ndeposits the trousseau of his wife with a beadle until a settlement is\nreached.83 A silk-weaver appoints a beadle as executor of his will, a\nphysician makes another his attorney against a debtor, and a rich\nwoman does the same in a matter of inheritance. We could cite more\ninstances for this.3\n\nIn only one example thus far has a beadle been found performing\npolice duties. He had caught a man and confined him in his house,\nbecause it was Passover week when the courts did not sit. On the con-\ncluding holiday, however, when the beadle was, of course, busy in the\nsynagogue, the accused escaped through a window.85 This event hap-\npened in April, 1028, to a beadle of the Babylonians in Old Cairo.\nPerhaps in this respect, too, the Babylonians had their own tradi-\ntions. It is well known that in the lands of the Eastern caliphate, the\nauthorities of the minority groups were sometimes permitted to im-\nprison or to inflict corporal punishment on their members.\n\nIn his book, Israel Abrahams surmises that in the period of the\nGaons the offices of the beadle and that of the messenger of the court\nwere not combined in one person. Others held a different opinion.\nThe answer to this and similar questions is that no rigid and unified\nsystem prevailed with regard to this communal institution as to\nothers. In one letter of appointment, the service of the court appears\nas one of the most substantial duties of the beadle. In others, it is not\neven mentioned. Normally, a number of beadles served a community\nat one and the same time, and at one point there were five in the\nEgyptian capital. Thus they could divide the various duties among\nthemselves.88\n\nThe beadle lived in the synagogue compound. One letter of ap-\npointment makes it incumbent on him to be present there “together\nwith his boys.”87 Sometimes his family encroached on the synagogue\n\nGoitein, S. D.

(According to The Arabian\nNights breeding carrier pigeons on one’s roof was a sport of people of\nlow class.)®8\n\nIn this letter, as well as in another addressed by the same man to\nthe Nagid in reference to the same matter, the assertion is made that\nthe deputy judge in charge of that synagogue, also called muqaddam,\ndid nothing without consulting the beadle. That official had become\nso confident of his position that he would refuse to obey orders incon-\nvenient for him even if they were conveyed to him in the name of the\nNagid.® Similarly, in a letter written much later, a shammish is\ncharged with having brought an unworthy preacher to the syna-\ngogue.?® The actual scope of an office was obviously defined by the\npersonality of its holder rather than by hard and fast rules.\n\nThe position of a shammash was even more fortified if he remained\nin office for a long time. The beadle of the Babylonians, against\nwhom such strong representations were made before the Nagid Mevo-\nrakh, was appointed in 1099, but still at his post in June, 1127, many\nyears after the Nagid had died.

He could hardly be a kind of town crier, since\nhere one would have expected an Arabic rather than a Hebrew term.\nPerhaps he acted as a solicitor of contributions to the synagogue, who\nannounced the pledges in a loud voice.100\n\nPersons called murahhit, writers, and perhaps also singers, of litur-\ngical poetry and their families appear not infrequently in the list of\nbeneficiaries of the community chest. This important medieval call-\ning would certainly have been even more conspicuous in the genuine\nrecords, had not the cantors fulfilled a similar task.101\n\nSeveral community officials bearing Greek or Latin titles occur in\nancient Geniza records. Because of their sporadic mention their exact\nfunctions during our period cannot be ascertained, although the\nmeaning of the words concerned is well known.102\n\nPublic service and the principle of heredity.—In Arabic, as well as\nin Hebrew, the notion of public service was expressed by the same\nword as in English, namely, service. With a pun on I Kings 12:7 (“be\na slave to this people today . . .\") a Palestinian patriarch was credited\nwith saying to two scholars who shunned public office: “You imagine\nit is rule that I give you; no, it is servitude.”?93 This usage was ap-\nplied to the highest as well as to the lowest office and appears in a\nlaudatory context, as expressing the writer’s exertion for the com-\nmon weal, and in a pejorative sense, as a censure of the dependence\non emoluments that were not much different from the recourse to\npublic charity.104\n\nOne basic aspect of Jewish attitude toward public office, that re-\ngarding it as instituted by heavenly decree, is expressed in this tal-\nmudic saying: “Even the lowest irrigation official has been appointed\nby God.”195 This attitude is illustrated by a famous passage of Paul's\nepistle to the Romans (13:1): “There is no power but that of God;\ntherefore, the powers that be are ordained by God.” In a letter to the\nJewish community of Old Cairo, written in summer, 1040, the\nBaghdad exilarch and Gaon Hezekiah elaborates this point by em-\nphasizing the charismatic character of public office. Just as there are\npropitious times and places, so are there human beings chosen or re-\njected by God. Public office is like prophecy; he on whom God has\nbestowed the spirit, whom he has anointed as bearer of good tidings\n(Isaiah 61:1), he is the elected. Once the choice has been made, abso-\nlute obedience is due him.16 When, during strife in a community, a\nspeaker claimed that Jeroboam, the rebel (I Kings 12), “was better”\nthan the anointed from the house of David because he was followed\n\nGoitein, S.

The Palestinian Gaon Solomon\nb. Judah, in a letter to Ephraim b. Shemarya of Old Cairo lauds him\nas serving the people with all his heart and all his soul and all his\nmight—using the biblical phrase that refers to the service of God.108\nWhile reprimanding the same leader for quarreling with another, he\nwrites: “These times are not like those that have passed, when each\nof you was his own lord; now you belong to God and to Israel.”10?\nSimilarly a community official says in a letter from Acre, Palestine,\nsent almost immcdiately after its conquest by the Crusaders: “No one\nhas ever been dedicated to the service of Israel more than I have been\nthroughout my life.”11® A scholar from Ascalon, in retiring from\npublic service, describes himself as a servant of the local community,\nalthough he never derived any material gain from his office.1\n\nNormally, of course, public office was sought for gaining one’s live-\nlihood. “No man does service except for remuneration,” states Solo-\nmon b. Judah, the Gaon of Jerusalem.!!? In an application to a Nagid\nof Yemen, the writer describes himself as being fit for nothing except\nthe service ol the community.}’® Disappointment with regard to the\nexpectation of receiving a steady income from that source was only\ntoo frequent, as we have already seen with regard to the muqaddams\nin smaller places. There were other complaints. A man from Tunisia\nseeking a livelihood asks a friend to obtain work for him, “any work\nexcept the service of the people, for I am frail and skinny, and the\nservice of men is exacting.”14 Another writer, a cantor in a small\ntown, complains bitterly about his lack of opportunity for further\nstudy and about doing nothing but jingling off prayers. “All my life\nI have been tossed around in serving the Jews, being constantly oc-\ncupied with the care of foreigners and the poll tax for the poor,\nplaying around and trifling.”115\n\nUnhappy relations with the community were another and rather\ncommon cause of dissatisfaction. A remarkable, but unfortunately\nmuch damaged, letter contains among other telling passages the fol-\nlowing:\n\n1 am most miserable. Some envy me, others despise me; others, again, are\nhostile.

In a letter addressed most probably to Maimonides a\ncantor excuses himself for being unable to do a certain service for\nhim, since he had to officiate at a circumcision ceremony for a poor\nman. It was absolutely impossible for him to absent himself, “lest\npeople say that I was staying away because he is poor. ‘Had he been\nrich, I would have come and served him.\" You know how our peo-\nple are.”117\n\nMany documents illustrate the relationship between the public\nservant and the ecumenical or territorial authorities who had ap-\npointed or approved him. It was reciprocal. On the one hand, when\na Gaon or a Nagid was faced with a rival, he had to secure for him-\nself the allegiance of his appointees. In numerous letters we find\nsolicitations in this sense, or assurances of loyalty by officials, or ex-\ncuses and explanations in case the writer had faltered in his loyalty.\nA document in which officials from six small towns and villages in\nUpper Galilee reaffirmed their support of a certain Gaon is headed,\nwith a pun on Exodus 21:5, by the words: “I love my lord, I will not\ngo out free.”118\n\nThe most characteristic aspect of public service in the Geniza\nletters was the absence of rigid limits of demarcation between the\nvarious offices. “The mark of the mediaeval, as opposed to the Ro-\nman, system is its fluidity. No category is clearly defined. Whatever\nclass you belong to, you are constantly found performing the func-\ntions of another class.”11® This remark, made in a book on Byzantine\nmaritime law, also applies to the situation reflected in the Geniza\nrecords. A judge, a social service officer, a cantor, a scribe, each had\nhis specific qualifications and duties. All the same he would often be\ncalled upon to do another man’s work. Precisely because of this\nfluidity, however, we frequently find a muqaddam, a cantor, a\nteacher, or a ritual slaughterer jealously guarding the privileges de-\nrived from his respective office.\n\nWhen a public servant had a son who was able and willing to suc-\nceed him, it was regarded as proper to give him his father’s post.

The attendant of the tomb\nof Ezra, the most popular Jewish place of pilgrimage in Iraq, ob-\ntained certificates from both the Gaon Samuel b. Eli and an exilarch\npromising that his son would succeed him. When, after his death,\nsome opposition prevailed, these certificates stood his son in good\nstead, according to the letter of another Gaon who confirmed him in\nhis office on the basis of the promises mentioned.12?\n\nContracts of appointment have been found of even a beadle or a\nreligious slaughterer which refer to the fact that the father of the\nappointee had served in the same capacity. In one such contract,\nthough, it is stated with much empbhasis that another son would have\nno share in the services of the slaughterhouses, not even as a guard,\nbecause the community was not satisfied with his demeanor.

Thus, after\nan ambitious cantor from Baghdad had sojourned for years in Tunisia\nand Spain, he was informed by a childhood friend, a Gaon, that all\nthe older hazzinin had died and that it was now his turn to become\nthe muqaddam, or chief of the cantors.!?* A similar procedure seems\nto have been in force with regard to the appointment of beadles.\n\nWhen an official had no male offspring, or had a son who was not\ninclined to follow his father’s profession, he would look for a suitable\nson-in-law as his successor.1?8 Naturally, a son-in-law, too, sometimes\nhad other plans and strived for a higher position than that occupied\nby his father-in-law.126\n\nIn Jewish, as in Muslim, society, the principle of heredity was\nparticularly effective with regard to the families of judges.

Perhaps\nthe wider range of occupations open to Jews during the Geniza period\ninduced younger people to look for jobs other than those held by\ntheir fathers. Moreover, the free enterprise society of that time looked\ndown on income derived from service and salary. An inquiry into the\nfinances of the community will help us understand the background\nof this attitude.\n\nC. THE SOCIAL SERVICES\n1. Their General Character and Organization\n\nEven an affluent society dedicated to the ideal of free enterprise\ncannot do without social services. Free education for all, Social Secur-\nity, aid to the unemployed, Medicare—all taken for granted in the\nUnited States of America—are cases in point. In a time and a society\nin which poverty and ill health were rampant and in which the im-\nperfection of technology and the lawlessness of man made life pre-\ncarious, there was an even greater need for public assistance to the\nfaltering individual. The governments, whether central or local, did\nnot feel themselves called upon to meet this need. As far as the Mus-\nlim majority was concerned, charity was semipublic: members of the\nruling class or otherwise wealthy people, after having drained the\npopulation, often returned to it a part of the spoils in the form of\npious foundations, or other charitable works, made to save the donor\non the Day of Judgment. Muslim philanthropy, although strangely\nindividualistic and seemingly lacking the impetus of communal co-\noperation and popular effort, was an impressive aspect of Islamic\nsociety during its periods of efflorescence. Interfaith charity, however,\nalbeit not entirely unknown, was of little, if any, practical import-\nance. The religious minoritics had to look after themselves. They\nwere burdened with supplying all the social services provided in our\nsociety by the states, municipalities, and other public bodies. How\nthe Jewish communities of the Mediterranean area and, in particular\nthat of Fustat, acquitted themselves of this noble and arduous task\nis revealed in detail by the documents of the Cairo Geniza.!\n\nThese communities had no statutory power to impose taxes on\ntheir members. Membership itself was not compulsory. In fact, there\nwas strong inducement and often direct encouragement to join the\nranks of the ruling religion. Hence, all charitable work had to be\ndone on a purely voluntary basis. Under these circumstances the\ncommunal services of the Geniza period, their vigor, scope, and con-\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Even where a superscription is provided, understand-\ning it correctly is by no means easy and to do so often requires careful\nexamination in connection with other relevant Geniza material.\nThus the “List of Taxpayers” printed in Gottheil-Worrell’s edition\nof Geniza fragments from the Freer Collection (pp. 66 L) is not what\nit was taken to be by the editors and other scholars who have made\nuse of it; rather it is a list of persons who vowed donations in order\nto enable the poor to pay their poll tax.\n\nFortunately, the handwriting of the more prominent scribes active\nin Old Cairo between approximately 1015 and 1265 is known, and\nso it is possible to fix the period to which many an undated list be-\nlongs. Moreover, numerous names mentioned in the lists reappear in\nthe dated records about public buildings or in other dated or datable\ndocuments. Finally, the professions of the persons listed or other de-\ntails given about them divulge the purpose of a list. Therefore, the\ntwo lists published in Jacob Mann’s The Jews in Egypt and in Pales-\ntine under the Fatimid Caliphs, 11, 246-247, cannot designate persons\ncontributing to a public fund, as the editor believed, for they men-\ntion one man in prison, another permanently disabled, a third blind,\nas well as many foreigners, several beadles and cantors, and a school-\nmaster. Mann was certainly impressed by the fact that in both lists\nthere appears Nahray (b. Nissim), an outstanding eleventh-century\nscholar, public leader, and businessman. Nahray, however, served for\nmany years as jurisconsult of the Jewish community of Old Cairo\nand as such was included in its payroll. To us it seems strange that\n\nGoitein, S. D.

As we shall presently see, in the\nGeniza period this was the normal procedure.\n\nOnly few of these lists have been edited thus far.2 I have scrutinized\nover four hundred more and tried to define their characters and fix\ntheir approximate dates. Appendix B describes the beneficiaries of\nthe community chest, both officials and needy people of all descrip-\ntions, as well as the varied benefits they received. Appendix C shows\nhow the funds financing these services were solicited and collected,\nas far as they were not derived [rom the revenue of real estate donated\nto the community, as specified in Appendix A. The three appendixes\nare arranged in approximately chronological order, while the tables\ntherein attempt breakdowns of the types of documents included in\neach.\n\nThe interested reader will find in the appendixes many significant\ndetails that could not be used in the summary description of the so-\ncial services provided in the text proper. They also reveal to him how\n1 arrived at my conclusions and provide him with a means to check\ntheir validity. The 484 documents assembled in these appendixes are\nfairly representative, but by no means exhaustive, and for two rea-\nsons. Wherever you find in the Geniza ten documents of a certain\ntype you can be sure that at least three or four others will turn up\nsome day, especially in the huge collections of literary or semiliterary\ncharacter which have never been screened completely. Moreover, it\nwas difficult to draw a strict demarcation line between the materials\nto be included in the appendixes and those merely to be mentioned\nor alluded to. The Geniza has preserved a large number of requests\nfor help and also of instructions by authorities on how to deal with\nsuch applications. Many aspects of privation and suffering, as well as\nthe ways and means to overcome them by concerted action of the\ncommunity, are echoed in the Geniza letters. The appendixes are\nrestricted to material of a more formal and official nature and should\nbe regarded as the main, but not as the exclusive, source of our infor-\nmation.\n\nThe student of the documents described in the appendixes should\nrecognize the difference between communal records, those charac-\nterized by their content, headings, or postscripts as referring to a\ncongregation at large, and administrators’ notes, those that list the\nrevenue and expenditure made solely by the official writing or dic-\ntating the document.

Failure to\nmake such a distinction may lead to unwarranted generalizations.\n\nAs explained in the chronological table in the Author’s Note pre-\nceding the appendixes, we are fairly well informed about the first\nhalf of the eleventh century, then again about most of the twelfth\n(with notorious gaps concerning some shorter periods). Many docu-\nments, albeit often of inferior value, refer to the first half of the\nthirteenth century, a period of complete decay for the Fustat com-\nmunity.

In view of the wealth of information\navailable, the description of the social services furnished on the fol-\nlowing pages should be regarded as no more than spadework. I have\nalso refrained from comparing the Geniza material with Islamic\ndeeds and literary sources with respect to such pious foundations as\nhospitals, schools, and libraries, and the amounts of cash, loaves of\nbread, clothing, and other emoluments allocated to the persons em-\nployed in them. Most of these foundations were princely creations\nthat flourished later than the Geniza documents. Even so, such a\ncomparison might be fruitful. Since research in Islamic social services\nis itself still in a rather rudimentary stage, the comparative study\nrecommended here wins by deferment.\n\nEcumenical aspects.—The most impressive aspect of Jewish philan-\nthropy as reflected in the Geniza record is its ecumenical character.\nThe principle “charity begins at home,” or, as a Hebrew saying has\nit, “the poor of your town have precedence over those of another”\nwas regarded as a religious injunction and is so referred to in Geniza\nletters.# The very existence of such an injunction shows that at the\ntime it was pronounced much was done for the needy outside the\nlocal community. The character of the Jewish community, or, per-\nhaps of Mediterranean society in general, precluded parochialism.\n\nIn the first place, the maintenance of the ecumenical seats of learn-\ning in Jerusalem and Baghdad was a major concern for all Jewish\ncommunities, large and small.5 Local institutions of higher learning\nor even individual scholars could likewise count on the support of\n\nGoitein, S.

In the course of my work on the India\ntrade I have come across a number of letters proving that the Jewish\nmerchants of Aden regularly sent gifts to both local and foreign\nscholars and divines in Egypt. Presents made to a scholar were re-\ngarded as an equivalent to the offerings on the altar in the ancient\nTemple of Jerusalem. It was the quality of the scholar, not his where-\nabouts, which mattered.®\n\nA similar rule applied to the poor. Gifts were sent to localities in\nwhich the need was greatest. It seems strange to us that a merchant\nfrom Aden, a native of that south Arabian port, should dispatch to\n0O1d Cairo the very substantial sum of 20 dinars for the benefit of the\npoor of that city.” Since, however, the capital of Egypt was a refuge\nfor the victims of persecution and misery who came from all over the\nworld, so that the demands made on its Jewish inhabitants by far\nexceeded their financial capacity, others felt obliged to share part of\nthe burden. The Geniza has preserved a letter from Najera in the\nkingdom of Castile, Spain, describing what that community had done\nfor a woman whose husband had been killed and who had to be\nransomed together with her two daughters, and admonishing other\ncongregations to follow suit. When we find “the woman from Spain”\nin an ancient list of receivers of alms in Old Cairo, we should not\njump to the conclusion that the unhappy widow from Najera is\nmeant, but only note that such occurrences were common.® Similar\nrequests were made in a letter from the community in Granada,\nSpain, and another from Arles in southern France.? The largest single\ngroup of needy people appearing in our lists was the foreigners and\nof them the largest group was persons coming from Europe.!® Under\nsuch circumstances it was proper and natural that the wealthy mer-\nchants of Aden, whose livelihood depended on the prosperous trade\nbetween the Mediterranean area and India, should send their con-\ntributions to Old Cairo, and not only to the scholars living there but\nalso to the poor.\n\n[n order to alleviate its burden, the community in the Egyptian\ncapital would send help-seeking foreigners on to the provincial\ntowns and villages. “Kindly take care of this man and his large\nfamily, as Iong as we are busy with collecting money for the poll tax\nof the poor.

This procedure was adopted particularly for ransom and\nsupport of persons who had fallen into the hands of pirates or foes;\nin either case great financial sacrifices were required. While Alex-\nandria, the usual port of arrival of such captives, and Old Cairo, their\nnormal destination, had to shoulder the main burden, we see from\nreports preserved in the Geniza that the smaller communities also\nmade very substantial contributions. This is all the more remarkable\nsince most of these captives came from Byzantium or other parts of\nEurope, and their liberators were not familiar with their language\nand social habits.3\n\nAnother concern of ecumenical scope was the support of the poor,\nthe devout, and the scholars of the Holy City. The permanent state of\nanarchy in which Palestine found itself during the eleventh century\nand the crushing taxation imposed on the minorities (and perhaps\nalso on other sections of the population) had a ruinous effect on the\neconomy of the country. Financial aid to the Jewish community\nthere, which had always been regarded as a religious duty, now be-\ncame a dire necessity. The Geniza records deal with this subject far\nmore than the published materials would indicate. Special collec-\ntions, made for the purpose, were called tafrigat al-magadisa, liter-\nally, the distribution (of the amounts due from the individual\nmembers of a local community) of (the sum to be sent to) the Jeru-\nsalemites, and were held, like the collections for the distribution of\ncash among the local poor, on, or, rather, shortly before the holi-\ndays.”* A fund raiser would be sent from Jerusalem, someone other\nthan the permanent envoy of the yeshiva who had to be a scholarly\nperson and carried assignments additional to collecting money.1s\n\nThe amounts collected in Egypt, Sicily, and the Maghreb in a joint\nKaraite-Rabbanite emergency campaign for Jerusalem, the payment\nof the debts of the Jewish community there to the Muslim money-\nlenders (C 4), are the largest raised in any public appeal in the Geniza\nwith the exception of ransoms for captives and special impositions by\nthe government. One has to bear in mind, of course, that the Jerusa-\nlem community had to take care of the many destitute persons visit-\ning or taking their domicile in the Holy City and had to pay fixed\ncontributions even in years when, because of war or other calamities,\nno pilgrims with means made their appearance.\n\nAt times a donor would earmark his contribution to Jerusalem for\n\nGoitein, S.

Thus the congregation in Bilbays in the Nile Delta\nentrusted “gold” to a traveler leaving for Jerusalem with the instruc-\ntion to deliver one part of it to “the synagogue of the Yemenite” and\none to “the rabbis” (dated 1214). These specifications find their ex-\nplanation in other Geniza letters. We learn that a rabbi from Yemen\nhad lived for a certain time in Bilbays (and married a wife there; it\nwas not a happy marriage), but later settled in Jerusalem and\nfounded a synagogue there.’® *The rabbis” could be taken as a gen-\neral term, but it is likely that the reference is to the newly arrived\nFrench rabbis, for a scholar from France had served as spiritual\nleader in that Egyptian town and later sent to that congregation a\nrequest for support from Jerusalem.!?\n\nEarly in the eleventh century a house in Old Cairo was made a\ncharitable foundation for the benefit of the poor in Jerusalem, to\nwhich other houses, destined for the same purpose, were added later.\nWe are able to trace the history of this “Jerusalem compound”\nthrough almost two hundred years. Similarly, revenue from stores in\nRamle, the administrative capital of Palestine, covered most of a\nyearly imposition to be paid by the Jews of Jerusalem during the\nearly decades of the eleventh century.

Futhermore, on occasions such as the donation of wheat for\nholidays or fast days the affluent or more liberal or more religious by\nfar outstripped the rest of the contributors. Finally, in cases of special\nurgency, but limited scope, for instance, when a foreigner had to be\nsupplied quickly with travel expenses, often no general appeals were\nmade, but a number of notables put the money needed together.\n\nIn contrast with these “oligarchic” ways of philanthropy, the\nbreakdown of types of documents at the end of Appendix C reveals\nthe surprising facts that in many collections participation must have\n\nGoitein, S.

Persons known from other sources as important government\nofficials, great merchants, or physicians would give only 1 or even 5\ndirhem, while the bulk of the contributors would vow 15 or 14\ndirhem. We must always keep in mind that many of the lists are\neither imperfectly preserved or limited in scope by their very purpose\n(a frequent example: payments by, or solicitation of, persons who\nhad not yet contributed). When the list C 39, with about 105, mostly\nprospective, contributors, notes only one dyer, while the contem-\nporary C 46, which is incomplete, has fourteen of them (out of 127\nnames accompanied by amounts), it is evident that not only the long,\nbut incompletely preserved list C 46, but also the apparently intact\nC 39 represents only a fraction of the members of the Rabbanite\ncommunity of Fustat. We must therefore assume that certain types\nof collections were practically all comprising, comparable with the\npayment of membership fees in a modern congregation.\n\nIn the most extensive list preserved (C 55), which is preceded by\nan explanatory introduction, it is correct to assume that all capable\nmembers contributed, and the pledges listed show that this was ac-\ntually so. That “urgent appeal” concerned wax candles for the illu-\nmination of a synagogue and the houses of the poor. (Candles were\ngiven to 32 persons out of a community of “less than 200” adult\nmales.) In an appeal of this type one would expect that each partici-\npant would give according to his means and wishes. But this was not\ntrue. Everyone, high and low, from the Nagid Abraham Maimonides\nto a cook or a tailor paid 1 dirhem per adult male in his household.\nOnly sugar factories and taverns were taxed higher as specifically\nprofitable undertakings.\n\nThe identity of characteristic names proves that the strictly “egali-\ntarian” list G 32 was contemporary with G 383, where six different\nlevels of contributions are to be discerned, and the same holds true\nfor the long and detailed lists C 46 and 47 as compared with C 41 and\nother simultaneous records. It is thus evident that for certain types of\ncharity comparatively small sums were solicited, but everyone was\nexpected to contribute. This principle seems to have applied to the\nweekly collections for the mezdénat, or food (read: bread) for the\npoor, from which in later times other communal expenses were also\npaid, and to the contributions for the payment of the poll tax for\nthose who were unable to pay it in full or at all. Above we also had\nthe strange case of the appeal for wax candles, which, as the ninth\nentry in the breakdown of the types of documents at the end of\nAppendix B shows, must have been a quite regular feature (presum-\n\nGoitein, S.

The preamble to that document (G 55) says\nexpressly: “We shall shoulder it with united forces,” nahmilha yad\nwahida, meaning that the payments will be in equal shares.\n\nPopular participation expressed itself not only in monetary con-\ntributions. Everyone wanted to have a say in the use of funds and see\nfor himself how they were used. The preamble of the drive just men-\ntioned and the numerous appeals to congregations preserved (of\nwhich C 92-96 are good examples) illustrate the all-comprising\npublicity of communal philanthropy. Even a Nagid giving an order\nof payment from a public fund would state that it was made “with\nthe consent of the community.” 1 Most of the communal accounts\nand many of the lists of recipients or donors are written in large,\ncalligraphic characters, because they were destined for display in the\nsynagogue, all members being invited to scrutinize them. One docu-\nment even states that everyone was not only entitled but religiously\nbound to advise the court of any inaccuracy to be found in the report,\nwhich, for this purpose, remained suspended for four months.2\n\nThe popular scope of medieval philanthropy had its root in reli-\ngion, the belief that charity was one of the foremost religious duties\nand the safest path to the atonement of sins and to salvation. We are\ntherefore not surprised to find men styled “The Pious” and a woman\ncalled “The Ascetic” prominent as donors.?!\n\nThe community chest.—In cities with more than one synagogue,\ndonations were sometimes made and houses acquired for individual\nsynagogues, but the social services were usually communal, compris-\ning all the coreligionists living in one place, rather than congrega-\ntional.22 In the capital of Egypt, which in those days consisted of two\ndifferent cities, Old Cairo (Fustat) and the newly founded Cairo,\neven the payrolls of the various synagogues sometimes appear com-\nbined in one list.23\n\nThe property and assets of the community were called gédesh,\n“the holy,” a designation going back to ancient times when the\ntreasury of the nation was stored in the precincts of the Temple of\nJerusalem. The term conveyed the idea that anything dedicated to\nthe common good was given to God, an idea familiar also to contem-\nporary Islam where mal al-muslimin, “belonging to the Muslims,”\nwas synonymous with mal Alldh, “belonging to God.” From qédesh\nwas derived a verb (also in Judeo-Arabic: aqdas) meaning, literally,\ndedicate to a holy purpose. This usage strongly emphasized the reli-\ngious character of charity and certainly was not without influence on\nthe minds of the givers.2#\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The organization of charity and other communal needs, such\nas the payment of officials and the maintenance and administration\nof buildings, was far more complicated. The income of the commu-\nnity consisted of regular collections, special appeals, miscellaneous\nitems like fines or wills, revenue from the slaughterhouses and, in\nparticular, of rents from the many buildings turned into charitable\nfoundations. While certain types of expenditure were met regularly\nby such specific sources of revenue as the distribution of bread by\nweekly collections or the maintenance of buildings by the rent raised\nfrom them, many other types were not. Therefore, in orders of pay-\nment on account of the community chest, the source from which the\nexpenditure was to be made had to be indicated, expressly or by\nimplication.s\n\nA beautiful illustration of this state of affairs is a report on daily\nexpenses made for a distinguished sick foreigner in the course of\ntwo weeks. Every day he received one or two chickens, potions, and\nother food, and there were expenses for bandages, laundry, and\nlighting. As compensation for his expenses the man looking after\nhim received (a) payments from a parnis administering (or, rather,\nfarming the rent from) houses belonging to the community, (b) con-\ntributions from individuals, the largest one amounting to 5 dirhems,\n(¢) the proceeds of a collection made especially for that purpose in\nthe two synagogues of Fustat, which brought, however, only 7 dir-\nhems, and, finally (d) a dinar weighing 238 qirats and worth 35-14\ndirhems from the Nagid (Samuel b.

We may assume the parnas in charge of the distribution of\nclothing and the one doling out wheat were informed of that obliga-\ntion imposed on the lessee.28 Houses were often given to “the poor”\nwithout any further specification. Many times, however, the purpose\nof the charitable foundation was indicated (see sec. 3, below).\n\nThis cumbersome system of financing the social services had its\nsource partly in the general technical imperfections of medieval ad-\nministration. The accumulation of public funds in one treasury was\nto some extent avoided in order to preserve them from the overreach-\ning of rapacious government officials. Only in a sixteenth-century\naccount does Arabic khizina, “treasury,” seem to denote a box in\nwhich all revenue was deposited and from which all expenditure was\nmade. That account is written in the Hebrew language, and the\nwriter, although using that Arabic word and dating according to\nMuslim months, apparently was a European, to judge from his\nspelling of Arabic names.2?\n\nReligious scruples, too, were involved in this splitting of communal\nrevenue and earmarking of its various units for specific purposes,\nnamely, the apprehension that one might use funds donated for one\ncharity for the financing of another. The Talmud tells the story of\na scholarly almoner who by mistake distributed money given for the\npoor in general as a special bonus on the feast of Purim and, having\nqualms about the propriety of his action, restituted the total amount\nfrom his own pocket.30 It was precisely with regard to this religious\ninjunction against “mixing the charities” that the authorities ap-\npearing in later Geniza documents were not always particularly suc-\ncessful. Even the instructions of the pious Nagid Abraham Maimo-\nnides contain examples of such occurrences, as when he assigned to\na Maghrebi traveler money collected for a person from an Egyptian\nlocality (B 78). The same account, written by Solomon b. Elijah,\ncontains the following entry: “On the eve of the New Year 1 took\na loan of 7 dirhems from the money of the wife of Farah, given in\ntrust to me by the Nagid, for the purchase of 10 pounds of olive oil\nfor the synagogue of the Palestinians.” At the time of the Nagid\nJoshua, Abraham’s great-grandson, the impoverishment of the\nFustat community had reached such a degree that once he had to\norder them to take from the item “Food for the Poor” 150 dirhems\nthat had been advanced by five notables for the payment of the poll\ntax; everyone objecting to this extraordinary measure and refusing to\ncontribute to the collection for “Food” under these circumstances\nwould be excommunicated!3!\n\nThe community chest, although not a legal person in the strict\n\nGoitein, S.

As a rule it was in the hands of\n“the trustworthy elders in charge of public property and communal\naffairs,” as the representatives of the community were called.?3 Con-\ntracts of lease of public property or agreements related to it were\nwritten in the names of the elders, or, as other legally valid docu-\nments, signed by three persons, usually including a judge.* Occa-\nsionally, a parnas would appear as the leaser, perhaps an imitation of\nthe Muslim practice. The Geniza has preserved a contract—in Arabic\ncharacters, of course—where one of the administrators of the mosques\nof Cairo leases a small garden house to one ‘Ali b. Hassan b. Ma‘ali\nal-Taribulusi (of Tripoli), who could have been a Muslim, Christian,\nor Jew, but since his contract was found in the Geniza, most probably\nwas Jewish.35\n\nAn expenditure from the community chest required the witness of\nat least two representatives of the community. Since people were busy\nwith their own affairs, a parnds normally had several elders at his\ndisposal, from whom he could choose one to assist him in a transac-\ntion. In one account a welfare officer mentions five different persons\nwith whose knowledge he had carried out minor repairs in houses\nbelonging to the community or made other payments for it.3%8 The\nprocedure adopted for larger expenditures is well illustrated in the\ndocument A 20. The parnis, who had farmed out the revenue from\nthe house or houses dedicated to the poor of Jerusalem, had made all\nexpenses for the very considerable repairs (the equivalent of about\ntwo months’ revenue) in the presence of one responsible elder, who\nwas assisted by another. Then the two elders testified to the transac-\ntions before three judges, whose signatures ratified the accounts.\n\nIn the time of the Mishnah (first and second centuries A.p.), the\nposition of public trust inherent in the task of almoners was regarded\nso highly that daughters of almoners were qualified to marry into the\npriestly aristocracy. It is one of the surprises of the Geniza that it\ncontains a statement by a judge to the effect that a certain perfumer\nhad been in charge of the weekly collections for the poor in the\ncourse of the year 1161. Did the perfumer need that certificate for\nhimself (perhaps for a lawsuit), or was a daughter of his about to\nmarry into a particularly fastidious family?

This source of revenue, which in the course of the twelfth\ncentury became the most important single item in the budget of the\ncommunity of Fustat, is.treated in section C, 3, below.\n\nThe ways of public finance of the Jewish communities were by no\nmeans uniform even within Egypt. Alexandria, about which we are\ncomparatively well informed, adhered to a system entirely different\nfrom that of Fustat. There, as was common in later times in many\nJewish congregations in Europe, the main item of communal revenue\nwas “the slaughterhouse,” that is, a tax on meat, the food of the\nmore affluent. A letter to Solomon b. Elijah inquiring whether his\nfather, the judge Elijah, would be prepared to become the spiritual\nleader of the two synagogues of Alexandria promises as his main (or\nsole) emolument the income from the slaughterhouses, while the\norphans of his predecessor would receive 10 dirhems a week from the\nsame source.! In another letter on the same matter to the same ad-\ndress the writer says: “The slaughterhouses are the city,” meaning\nthat they are the main source of revenue of the community.?2 The\nAlexandrian official who wrote the letter described in C 84 also re-\nceived part of his remuneration from this item of revenue.\n\nIt stands to reason that Alexandria, which was closely connected\nwith Palestine, followed Palestinian practices in this matter, as in\nmany other respects. For in Ramle, too, we find that “the market”\n(an abbreviation for “the market where the animals are killed,” as\nanother document formulates it), or “the markets,” composed a\nmajor part of the income of the religious dignitaries, the distribution\nof which looms large in the correspondence of the Gaon Solomon b.\nJudah.3\n\nIn contradistinction, revenue from the abattoirs was of little con-\nsequence in Fustat. The professional killers of animals were commu-\nnal officials inasmuch as they were appointed to their posts by the\nreligious authorities. But economically they were on their own. They\nleased the revenue from the community against a fixed weekly pay-\nment of comparatively small sums (7-8 dirhems). This whole matter\n-of ritual killing, so strange to the modern mind, but essentially a\nmodified form of sacrifice, is discussed below in connection with the\nprofessions of the divines.*\n\nThere was another, main feature of public charity in which Alex-\nandria followed old Palestinian ways and differed entirely from\nFustat: the quppa (shel seddqa). In later Hebrew this simply means\n.alms box, and in modern Hebrew quppa is the window of a cashier in\na bank or a store.

While change\nwas hard to come by, it was easy to prepare at home a few more loaves\nof bread than the family needed and it also gave the woman of the\nhouse the opportunity to be continuously engaged in a meritorious\nwork of piety. Technically this was possible because they made two\ntypes of bread, the flat, soft loaves that were eaten fresh, preferably\nwarm from the oven, and another, hard variety, a kind of biscuit that\ncould stand a long time. Thus, we find that an almoner could sell old\nbread that was left over from a distribution for a price not much less\nthan new loaves (see B 77). I assume that on Friday, the traditional\nday of distribution (in Fustat there were two such days, Tuesday and\nFriday [see below]), bread of each type was given, the fresh and soft\nkind for consumption on the Sabbath and the hard biscuits for the\nrest of the week. I have not yet found this detail referred to in the\nGeniza, but the special collections of fresh loaves of bread “on Friday\nnight and other nights,” reported for Fustat, may point in this direc-\ntion.’\n\nThe term “quppa” is never mentioned in connection with Fustat.\nSince we possess hundreds of records and letters referring to charity\nfrom that city, this can only mean that the institution characterized\nby that word did not exist there. Thus far the only list containing\nvows for the donation of quantities of bread found in the Geniza (C\n53), I have attributed to Alexandria, and the specific circumstances\nthrough which it has come to Fustat have been explained in my de-\nscription of the document. There are at lcast three other documents\nmentioning the quppa of Alexandria: a certificate from the year\n1253, entitling an old man of a distinguished and pious family to\nreceive weekly rations of bread from that source; ¢ a letter of an ad-\nministrator of that charity (n. 41, below); and, finally, a detailed and\nmost interesting description by an Alexandrian judge of the tensions\nin the community during the early years of Saladin’s reign. His op-\nponent, the president of the congregation, threatened to discontinue\nthe payment of his salary and, instead, have twenty persons deliver to\nhim their weekly contributions to the quppa. Whether these contri-\nbutions were meant to be in cash or kind, or partly in loaves and\npartly in money (as in C 53) is not evident from the text, but it seems\nmore likely that loaves indeed were meant since that tyrant wanted\nto do harm to his adversary.” A quppa is also mentioned in a letter\n\nGoitein, S.

The first term is He-\nbrew, although it appears often in an Arabicized form (basiga and\nthe like), and carries with it a religious connotation: it was a vow\nthat had to be fulfilled. The second is Arabic, a term familiar also in\ncommerce; a long interval, often two months or more, intervened be-\ntween the “handshake” and the “collection” in commercial transac-\ntions.?\n\nA pesiga was arranged both for the regular budget of the commu-\nnity and for any particular need requiring attention. A contract with\na beadle provides for the same emoluments as those granted to his\npredecessors, namely, in addition to the poll tax and “extras,” for\ntwo pesiqas a year, which means that twice a year a number of per-\nsons would vow to contribute a certain sum for him.1® One pesiqa\nwas usually made on the Day of Atonement since, as explained be-\nfore, charity was regarded as a means of expiation. In a letter to a\nfriend in the capital, a schoolmaster in a small town reports the\n(poor) results of the vows made for him on that day; in another, a\nscholar is promised a “worthy” pesiqa, if he consents to settle in\nAlexandria.l? The yearly payment of the poll tax for the poor, one\nof the main concerns of any minority group under Islam in those\ndays, was covered by a pesiqi; so also were the contributions to the\nseats of learning.12\n\nOn the other hand, the most varied purposes were served by the\nsame means. A man who was unable to meet his obligations reports\nthat a pesiga in his favor had brought a substantial sum, but more\nthan a month had passed without his getting the money (and the\ncreditors had become uneasy, presumably because they suspected the\ndebtor had pocketed the proceeds himself).1* An official of the cali-\nphal mint, who had fled from the capital to Alexandria, expected to\nbe granted a pesiqa there, but the community of that city was neither\nin a position nor in the mood to do so. A Palestinian cantor, who\ndisplayed his art in Alexandria, was also deeply disappointed: the\npesiga brought only 2 quarter dinars and 60 dirhems, of which\nhardly 10 had remained with him when he wrote his complaint.14 A\nschoolmaster from Algeria who was forced to live in a small town in\n\nGoitein, S.

Since the weekly collection was the backbone of recur-\nrent revenue, numerous documents refer to it, but it is not always\neasy to understand their purport. The following seems to have been\nthe established procedure adhered to through the centuries: During\nor shortly after the High Holidays that initiate the Jewish calendar\nyear the members of a congregation vowed how much they would\ncontribute every week. A number of collectors (documents from the\neleventh and thirteenth centuries mention by name eight to twelve\nat a time) would make the rounds every day except Saturday. On\nSunday and Monday they would not collect much, but from Tuesday\non the payments would be fuller and the service on Thursday morn-\ning was the occasion for trying to reach the weckly goal of contribu-\ntions. The sums cashed in would be handed over to the parnasim,\nif they did not do the collecting themselves. The parnis would then\ndraw up a list either of the individual donors or of the sums brought\nin by each assistant collector, and he would note—on the left side of\nhis account or on a separate sheet—the sums paid to community of-\nficials and needy people or spent for other purposes.28\n\nIn addition to the weekly collection, whose main purpose was the\ndistribution of bread to the needy, there was a recurrent appeal for\nwheat, which was also addressed to the community at large.

It seems, however, that to appeals issued close to\none another in time the same persons made approximately the same\ncontributions.2” The frequency of these appeals and the quantities\nreceived by the beneficiaries are discussed in subsection 4b, below.\n\nThe amounts required for this charity must have been very large\nsince the recipients of bread rations appear also in the lists of those\npartaking of the distributions of wheat. We might therefore be right\nin assuming that everyone who was able to do so was expected to con-\ntribute. The “Wheat Collection of Av [July-Aug.] 1178\" lists 110\nhouseholds making donations during two days. But it is more than\nprobable that the drive was pursued throughout the whole period of\nmourning of the first nine days of Av, which culminates in the fast\ncommemorating the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem.28\n\nA third regular collection was that for clothing the needy and the\nlower community officials. A booklet containing a report about one\nsuch appeal is entitled “Collection for the Clothing for the Year\n1185-1186\" (details in C 118). This evidence, however, should not\ninduce us to assume that only one clothing drive a year was held. The\nlists referring to the handing out of articles of clothing suggest at\nleast two yearly distributions. The sums of money required for this\ncharity must have been high, so it stands to reason that several ap-\npeals were made in the course of a year.\n\nIn view of the widespread custom, common even among well-to-do\npeople in those days, of acquiring and wearing used garments, one is\nsurprised to find no reference to the collection of old clothes for the\nbenefit of the poor. The answer is to be found in the lists relating to\nthe distribution of wearing apparel, in that they show that the com-\nmunal authorities were extremely anxious for persons of like social\nstatus to receive clothing of exactly the same type. Any attempt to\ndistribute used garments would have led to endless jealousies and\nperhaps even to disorders.\n\nThe three appeals just surveyed provided only for the most basic\nneeds.

In a will\nmade in Alexandria in January, 1143, a woman decrees that any\nmoney remaining after the payment of the burial expenses and of\nthe sums bequeathed by her to relatives (with the exclusion of her\nson) should be given to the poor, but charged her executor with this\ntask, not the officials of the community chest, while the court was to\nchoose the charities worthy of consideration.?®\n\nTo conclude this summary with an example that does not lack a\ncertain humorous flavor: A woman in a little town had left to the\ncommunity a valuable cloth of siglaton, a fabric highly cherished in\nthe East and in Europe. Musing about what to do with this piece of\npublic property, the elders decided to let each member of the congre-\ngation wear the precious garb one Sabbath. A learned judge, whose\ndecision was requested in this matter, denounced the idea and sug-\ngested instead to sell the siglaton and to use the money to buy a book\nfor the synagogue library or for repairs or lighting.40\n\nIn times of famine or other calamities causing scarcity of food the\nsocial officers could incur severe hardship and even dangers, a fact\nthat is well illustrated in a complaint about calumniation and threat\nto his life addressed by an administrator of charities in Alexandria to\nthe Nagid Abraham Maimonides around 1230. The Nagid had in-\nstructed the Jewish authorities in the Mediterrancan port to store\npart of the wheat collected to meet impending emergencies. The ad-\nministrator had acted accordingly with the result that only meager\nrations could be distributed. A rival scholar took advantage of the\nbardships and dissatisfaction of the poor, arranged a collection of his\nown, and immediately distributed the wheat that had accumulated.\nAt the same time rumors were spread that the administrator had ap-\npropriated some of the victuals destined for the poor. The incitement\nagainst the unhappy public servant culminated in a nightly attack\non him by a man who threatened to murder him if he did not dis-\ntribute the accumulated reserves immediately and hand over the\ncommunal accounts to another, specified person. The administrator,\nwho was backed by the acting judge, as well as by prominent scholars\nand notables, was urged to take legal action against his adversaries,\nbut, as he explained in the letter, because of the precariousness of the\n\nsituation, preferred to await a rescript of the Nagid or the return of\nthe chief judge to Alexandria.\n\nGoitein, S.

Charitable Foundations (Houscs and Other Communal\nProperty)\n\nDuring most of the Middle Ages, in western Europe and Byzantium\nas well as in the lands of Islam, charitable works and institutions of\nlearning were muaintained largely by the income from houses and\nother immovable property donated for the purpose. The Jewish com-\nmunity was no exception. The rich documentation found in the\nGeniza records on the subject furnishes a good deal of insight into\nthe working of this outstanding institution of pious foundations in\nIslamic countries, the early development of which is rather obscure.\n\nA report about the history of the houses belonging to the synagogue\nof the Palestinians in Old Cairo up to 1039 makes mention of only\neight houses and two stores. Two buildings and part of a third had\nbeen owed by the community from a time beyond the memory of the\nwitnesses (A 3, ca, 1010). The first generation of public servants\nknown to them by name, active around 960, acquired three additional\nbuildings and two shops in the immediate vicinity of the synagogue,\npartly with the income from the older houses and partly with funds\nspecifically collected for the purpose. In the next two generations an\napartment was built on top of those two shops and five out of twenty-\nfour shares in another house were bought; but most of the revenue\nwas spent on the synagogue building itself. Three years after the\ncompletion of its renovation the synagogue and the Liouses belonging\nto it were damaged or demolished in the wake of the religious perse-\ncution under the caliph al-Hakim (ca. 1012). After the churches and\nsynagogues were returned to their owners, many years passed until\neverything was restored. As before, signs were placed on the buildings\nstating to which synagogue they belonged and which caliphal author-\nization had been given for their ownership. Many constructions were\ncarried out during the years 426-430 A.H. (Nov. 16, 1034-Oct. 2,\n1038), for each of which exact accounts were publicly displayed. Such\naccounts, destined to be posted in the synagogue, have been found\nfor these and the succeeding years through 1044 (A 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 113-\n115, 117, 120-122). But the names of only two or three additional\nbuildings appear in them.\n\nA century later, during the second half of the twelfth century, the\nsituation was entirely different.

More than ninety such houses are mentioned in the\naccounts preserved from the years 1164 through 1215 (A 24-25), and\nnumerous new items appear in later documents.\n\nThis large increase in the number of charitable foundations might\nhave had its cause in specific circumstances, like the migration of\nwealthier families from Fustat to the more fashionable city and seat\nof the government, Fatimid Cairo, an exodus that precluded the\nprofitable sale of old houses and made it more commendable to their\nproprietors to give them away as a pious deed. It seems, however, that\nin the Islamic population, too, there occurred from the twelfth cen-\ntury on a vast increase in the number and scope of charitable founda-\ntions. Thus, the marked changes discernible in our records might\nhave owed to a general trend of the period rather than to causes\nspecific to the Jewish community.\n\nNaturally, the spiritual and communal leaders took the lead in\nthis movement. A house often mentioned in the eighties of the twelfth\ncentury was that of “the Nagid,” no doubt identical with that of “the\nRayyis Abli Mansiir,” the Arabic name of the Nagid Samuel b.\nHananya (1140-1159), prominent in the records of 1164 (A 24). His\nchancellor, the judge Nathan, also left a house to the community (A\n28, 31, 35). We happen to have a document about its history. His wife\nhad bequeathed to him half the house in which they lived and given\nthe other half to the godesh (A 18). It is not surprising that the judge\nfollowed the example of his wife when his own hour of death drew\nnear. A number of houses bear the names ‘Alam al-Dawla, Amin al-\nDawla, “Banner of the Dynasty,” “Trustee of the Dynasty,” and so\non, that is, of persons connected in one way or another with the gov-\nernment. A parnis, physicians, and merchants are among the donors,\nbut also a good number of artisans. Some of the most frequently\nmentioned houses are named after a glassmaker and a dyer, respec-\ntively. Many charitable foundations were established by women; we\nhave to remember that even in families with modest means it was\ncustomary for a bride to be given a house or part of a house as her\nmarriage portion.2 '\n\nThere were also certain types of property of which it is not stated\nhow they were acquired by the community. Such, for example, were\nthe “Oil House,” the “Vinegar House,” or the “Spinnery,” and the\nhospices called fundug, an Arabic word meaning caravanserai, but\nderived from Greek pandocheion, a building attached to a church or\n\nGoitein, S.

It was not always possible to lease all the apartments available.\nThe remark in A 6 (1042-1043), “empty this month,” shows that\nvacancies already occurred at a time when the community owned\ncomparatively few houses. In a later period we find vacancies in six\nout of fifteen houses, in three of them more than one, and in a fourth\ninstance the whole building remained empty (A 43). Some accounts\ncontain separate columns for unoccupied apartments.5 Half-empty\ndwellings entailed not only loss of revenue, but also the threat of\nencroachment by the government, as well as special expenses.? Under\nthese circumstances there is no wonder that rooms or apartments in\nthe synagogue compound were rented also to non-Jews. An early ex-\nample is found in A 10. Later on, the examples become frequent,\nincluding even a qadi, or Muslim judge. As it happened, he ab-\nsconded without paying the rent (A 43).\n\nMany accounts imply or state expressly that tenants were in arrears\nwith their rent. The list A 117 is devoted entirely to delinquent ten-\nants. In 1040-1041 the arrears amounted to one-third the total reve-\nnue from the communal houses (A 5). Tardiness in payments resulted\nsometimes in a reduction of the rent (A 142). There were other diffi-\nculties. A late statute for tenants, of which only the last four para-\ngraphs have been preserved, makes the following points: (a) No\nexcuse for nonpayment on time of the monthly rent is accepted.

In the\nevent of his failure to comply with the statute the tenant is threatened\nnot with eviction but with excommunication, “which would bring\ndamage to his person and to his property” (A 96).\n\nJewish as well as Muslim law provides that rents and wages are\npaid at the end of the periods for which they are due. In later times,\nhowever, when the community chest was in dire straits, the contracts\nit entered into show payments in advance for a full year and even for\ntwo years. In those contracts the rent was presumably lower than\nnormal, and in one instance this is expressly stated.8\n\nAs to the administration of the qodesh, we should not expect uni-\nformity throughout the centuries. Usually several persons dealt sim-\nultaneously with the varied property of the community. The official\nspecifically charged with this task and most frequently mentioned in\nconnection with it was the parnds.

In A 118 a cantor and a parnas cooperated, in A 148, a cantor,\na beadle, and a Christian joined in collecting the revenue.

Yet, the reforms introduced by that administrator must have\nbeen far-reaching, for over a hundred years later, in 1252, his letter\nof appointment was submitted to the Nagid David, Maimonides’\ngrandson, by some of the elders as forming the basis for all claims by\nor against the public chest (A 157).\n\nThe accounts of the collectors of revenue, partly drafts and partly\nclean copies, normally refer to one or to two months. There are also\nsome for longer periods, such as four months (A 28, 33, 35) or five (A\n6, 38). A summary of expenditure and revenue of six months coincid-.\ning with the second half of a Muslim year (A 24) seems to indicate\nthat yearly accounts for buildings were made, at least in certain\nperiods, according to the Muslim calendar and not the Jewish. Ut-\nmost caution is recommended for the use of these documents, since\nas a result of the predilection of the medieval scribe for variety, as\nwell as for other reasons (such as the change of tenants), the same\nbuilding not infrequently is referred to by two or three different\ndesignations. Moreover, in most cases only the actual receipts are\nlisted, and it is not indicated whether they represent the rent due or\nonly a fraction of it or, on the contrary, also contain the payments of\narrears.\n\nIn A 25-36 where we have twelve reports by the same collector\ncovering the comparatively short period of three years and seven\nmonths, we are on rather safe ground. Most of these records are in the\nhandwriting of a well-known judge, which means that they represent\nofficial documents approved by, or at least submitted to, the relevant\nauthority. Their scrutiny forms a good starting point for the study of\nthe administration of the buildings belonging to the Jewish commu-\nnity chest of Old Cairo.\n\nSince the idea of a central treasury was unknown, each collector\nserved also as a paymaster. His balance sheet showed the revenue on\nthe right side, and the expenditure on the left. The reason for this\norder of columns is, of course, that Arabic and Hebrew scripts run\nfrom right to left. Sometimes the revenue is written above the expen-\nditure. According to the purpose of the account, the side devoted to\nrevenue shows the payments of each tenant, or the total payment of\neach house, or the collector’s total monthly revenue in general. In\nsome accounts the arrears or additional payments of tenants are in-\ndicated.

In the half-yearly account A 24, the cost\nof repairs amounted to almost one-third the total revenue.\n\nIn addition to these expenses, countless items, changing every\nmonth, reveal the varied needs and social services of the community.\nIn the first place, there was the expenditure for (olive, sesame, or\nlinseed) oil for the lighting of places of worship, and for sundry\nother requirements. Second, payments for community officials and\nteachers (the latter received only small sums for the orphans and the\nchildren of the poor whom they happened to teach during the month\nconcerned). Third, an odd variety of grants to needy of all kinds.\nFinally, where there was a cash balance, purses of dirhems or dinars,\nor bankers’ notes, were handed over—not to a treasurer, for one did\nnot exist—but to specified persons such as a parnds, a cantor, or a\nbeadle; there were usually several individuals acting as treasurers\nduring onc month.\n\nWe have very definite information on the cost of the administra-\ntion of the qddesh. Many accounts, from 1164 through 1247, con-\nclude with the item “collection,” namely, the remuneration of the\ncollector, who, as we know, had also to do a good deal of other work\n(A 24, 25, 32, 35, 38, 95). The collector’s “fee” is invariably 10 percent\nof the revenue, which seems to be decent in view of the many-sided\ntroubles the administrator had to face. Occasionally, in particular\nin times of trouble with government officials, when much extra work\nwas required and when, without the collector’s fault, the revenue\nwas reduced, a special settlement with regard to the collector’s com-\npensation was made. We read about one rcached “according to a de-\ncision of the elders.” 11 A remuneration of only 5 percent (as in A\n149¢) is isolated as far as the administration of houses is concerned,\nbut is paraileled by fees paid for the collection of contributions\npledged at appeals.!?\n\nIt is still premature—at any rate, I do not regard myself sufficiently\ncompetent—to assess the total revenue from the immovable property\nof the Jewish community chest as reflected in the Geniza records.\nThe average total payments from the two groups of houses in A 25-36\n(dated 1181-1184) amount to about 450 dirhems per month, which\nwould give a yearly revenue of about 5,400 dirhems. With this may\nbe compared the semiannual account of 1164 (A 24) amounting to\n3,683 dirhems.

The same idea pervaded the\nIslamic waqf and it might even be that the formulation of Islamic\nendowment deeds influenced Jewish juridical practice. Before the\nlaw, the poor were ultimately the legal proprietors of the religious\nendowments, although, in fact only few would be their beneficiaries,\nexcept where they were made primary beneficiaries in express terms.\n\nHow long did the houses of the community chest survive its ad-\nministration? While trying to answer this question, we are again con-\nfronted by the possibility that different buildings at different times\nmight have had the same name, while one property might have\nchanged its designation. Thus, one is tempted to identify the “House\nof the Dyer,” prominent in the lists from around 1040, with the build-\ning bearing the same name in A 24 (1164) and in many of the ac-\ncounts relating to 1181-1183. In 1042-1013 it brought a total of 18\ndirhems per month (A 6) and in the 80’s of the twelfth century an\naverage of 16-14 dirhems. Dyeing, however, was a common Jewish\nprofession. Therefore, despite the similarity of name and circum-\nstances the identity is by no means sure. The compound dedicated to\nthe poor of Jerusalem is referred to in our records over the span of\ntwo hundred years. It may well be, however, that several donations\nof houses were made for the same purpose during that long period.\nIn any case, documents A 135 and 136 prove that stipends were reg-\nularly distributed from the revenue of these houses even during the\nyears in which, because of the Crusaders, practically no Jews lived in\nJerusalem (1099-1187). On the other hand, we learn from the docu-\nments of the 1040’s that houses changed their names during a com-\nparatively short period (for example, from “Little Cat” to “Camel,”\nboth names of persons). In legal documents we often meet with the\nformula “the house known at present under the designation X\" (A\n14). Therefore, the fact that, with the exception of the “House of the\nDyer” and the compound of the Jerusalemites, we do not find in the\n1180’s any of the houses of the 1040’s does not prove that all these\nbad ceased to exist.\n\nWe can be relatively certain only in buildings of exceptionally rare\nnames or in very special circumstances. The female name Muhra\n(“Filly”) has been found thus far only twice in the Geniza, or perhaps\ncnly once: “The House of Muhra” appears in A 24 (1164), A 94\n(1234), A 166; and in 1148 2 Muhra, who may be identical with the\n\nGoitein, S.

In the\nGeniza the name has been traced only once, in “The House of ‘Abla,”\ndetails about which are given in A 28 (1182) and A 94 (1284). The\nShe-Camel (also a female nickname) donated her house in 1127 (A\n128), which recurs in the lists A 24 (1164), A 39, A 45 (around 1215).\n“Lady Gazelle’s” house, often referred to in the documents of 1181-\n1183, was still in such good repair in Dzcember, 1243, that it could\nbe renovated at comparatively very low cost (A 155). The Ben Phine-\nhas house occurs in at least sixteen documents between around 1125\n(B 32) and 1215 (A 147). The house owned in common by the commu-\nnity chest and the Sharif (a Muslim notable) is mentioned from 1181\n(A 25) through 127 (A 95), and “The Tower,” the relic of a Roman\nlortification used as living quarters and storage house, is attested to\nfor the same period. We see, therefore, that it was not at all excep-\ntional for houses to remain in use by the gadesh for sixty to ninety\nyears. The period might actually have been far longer. Mention of a\nruin has been found only once in the accounts I collected (A 30 and\n35, both of which refer to 1183).

The same\nhouses bring less revenue, many rooms are unoccupied, and tenants\nabscond without paying. These changes are discussed in the context\nof the general development of the social services in the epilogue to\nthis section.\n\nOne fact stands out clearly: during the second half of the twelfth\nand the first half of the thirteenth century, for which period we have\ncomparatively rich documentation, the immovable properties, willed\nor denated to the community, yielded a large percentage of its regu-\nlar revenue.

The Beneficiaries of the Community Chest\n\na. THE OFTFICIALS\n\nThe minute division of labor characteristic of the Mediterranean\nsociety of the High Middle Ages required that persons devoting all or\nmost of their time to the service of the community should be remu-\nnerated by an income provided by that community. On the other\nhand, the principle of free enterprise ingrained in this society, and\nperhaps also its organizational weakness, prevented an arrangement\nsimilar to that prevailing today, where one fixed salary covers all the\nrecurrent emoluments received by a wage earner. The official of the\nGeniza period derived about a dozen different benefits from the com-\nmunity he served, Despite a certain regularity discernible in the\nsalary scales and other types of income in the Geniza records, each\nemployee seems to have worked under a special contract that also left\nconsiderable leeway for adapting the remuneration to performance.\n\nOne benefit, it seems, was granted to all officials, high and low: the\ncommunity paid their poll tax to the Muslim government. Whether\nit was the beadle of a synagogue in 1075, or the Jewish chief judge of\nthe capital in 1213, or a schoolteacher in a small town, payment of\nthe poll tax was made or promised for all of them, and there are\nmany other instances of this usage in our records.? As a matter of fact,\nthis arrangement remained unchanged up to late Ottoman times.2\nIn this respect the position of the ritual slaughterer was particularly\nnoteworthy. He had to deliver to the community a part of his weekly\nincome. But the community paid his poll tax.?\n\nThe payment of their poll tax by the community meant a great\ndeal to people who were short of cash. It scems, however, that this\nbenefit to community officials had more than financial significance.\nIt went back to the talmudic precept that scholars—and, as a rule,\nonly scholarly persons were appointed as community officials—should\nnot share the burdens imposed on the public. In its turn, this injunc-\ntion was bascd on a moral idea: “Learning makes one free: whoso-\never accepts the yoke of the Torah is exempted from the yoke of the\nrulers.” 4\n\nWith respect to salaries, various arrangements are evident in the\ndocuments.

A muqaddam in Hebron, Palestine, com-\nplains that he had received neither a pesiqa, a special payment vowed\nto him by the community, nor a mujama‘a, a weekly salary.s We\nread about both very often in our sources. With equal frequency we\nfind a monthly salary, in some cases paid to the same officials who\nappear in other records as receiving weekly wages. The reason for\nthis duplication was technical. The rents for the houses belonging to\nthe community were paid monthly; therelore, when the collector of\nthe rents acted as paymaster, salaries were calculated on a monthly\nbasis. On the other hand, when the wages were paid from the weekly\ncontributions of the community members, the payrolls were made\nout weekly. Since most of the relevant lists are undated, it is difficult\nto say whether an official received both weekly and monthly payments\nat one and the same time, although duplication might well have oc-\ncurred. A payment to a judge of 4 dirhems per month throughout a\nyear (B 97) is feasible only if he had copious other sources of income.\n\nOn this subject a letter by the Gaon Sir Shalém ha-Levi b. Moses\n(about 1176-1195) addressed to a provincial community is most in-\nstructive. In defining the rights of two clerics who had trespassed on\neach other’s prebends, he writes that both would continue to receive\nsibbitr, a regular payment from the community, as well as a pesiqa;\nin addition, one was permitted to act as a teacher and as a religious\nslaughterer (there were other teachers, and also cantors in the little\ntown), while only his rival was entitled to receive fees for writing\ndeeds of marriage and divorce and other legal documents and for\nperforming circumcisions. The tenor of the letter indicates that the\npayments of the community represented a subsidiary rather than the\nmain means of sustenance for the two complainants.®\n\nA pesiqa, or public appeal for officials, was usually arranged twice\na year—on the High Holidays in the fall, and in the spring (on Pass-\nover [B 99))—as well as on special occasions. Thus, when an inspector\nsent by the chief judge in the capital found that the French rabbi in\nthe Egyptian town of Bilbays was in dire circumstances, he addressed\nthe community on the rabbi’s behalf, which then vowed him 40\ndirhems.” Naturally, a pesiqgd was an excellent opportunity for the\nmembers of the congregation to manifest their estimate of the ser-\nvices of an official.\n\nThere were other such opportunities. The muqaddam of Hebron\nmentioned above complained that he received from the members of\nhis congregation neither a gift (in money) nor a present (in kind,\nsuch as a piece of clothing).® Personalized support was religiously\n\nGoitein, S.

The silver dirhems were delicately wrapped in a piece of\npaper before being handed over to the person honored.?\n\nMost community officials, from the cantors down, appear also as\nrecipients of loaves of bread, which were distributed twice a week,\nand also of wheat. They normally receive larger quantities than the\nneedy persons listed with them. This usage is evident in all relevant\nlists beginning with the very first one (B 1), from the year 1026 or so,\nto one written about two hundred years later (B 47). The officials are\neither designated as such or known to us by their names from other\nsources.\n\nThe student of Muslim administrative practice is familiar with\nthe fact that employees were paid partly in cash and partly in kind.\nThis arrangement applied to a private teacher as well as to a soldier or\nan army officer. The dinar jayshi the unit of soldier’s pay, consisted\nof a quarter of one dinar in cash and certain quantities of wheat and\noats.10 It may be, however, that including cantors, beadles, inspectors\nof slaughterhouses and of milk production, night watchmen, and\nothers, sometimes also parnasim, in the lists of the receivers of bread\nand flour was an old Jewish custom, the idea being that these cate-\ngories of people were regarded as belonging to the poor. For, unlike\nthe Muslim practice, where we find the heads and teachers of colleges,\nas well as librarians, in receipt of large numbers of loaves, and of\nmeat and other victuals, from the charitable foundations, the Jewish\nspiritual leaders are not assigned such emoluments, either in the lists\nof receivers (Appendix B) or in those of expenditure from public\nfunds (Appendix A). This difference between Muslim and Jewish\npractice needs further study.\n\nNo unified practice prevailed, it seems, in the distribution of\nclothing to officials. In some lists (B 25, 29, 33) cantors, beadles, and\nother lower officials and the parnas in charge of the distribution,\nreceived either a piece of clothing or a small monetary compensation.\nIn one list written around 1200 (B 38), a judge, a cantor, a beadle,\nand the distributing parnas are assigned the very handsome sum of\n45 bakhaya dirhems each, and as the parnis notes in a postscript that\nhe had already received 22-14, dirhems for a yiisufi cloth, we may as-\nsume that the sum of 45 dirhems was sufficient for two articles of\nwearing apparel.

From some\nreferences the impression is given that free lodging was granted these\nofficials, and one list states so explicitly.l? Some late accounts, how-\never, show them paying rents to the community chest like other ten-\nants.:3 Perhaps the general decline of the community of Old Cairo in\nthe thirteenth century contributed to this development. When we\nread that the community paid for repairs in “the room of the dayyan\nin the synagogue,” the office of the judge rather than his living quar-\nters was intended.!*\n\nAn important benefit to officials was the payment by the commu-\nnity of school fees for their children. In most cases it is not indicated\nwhether the boys referred to were orphans or not. In one account (B\n44), however, we find on one page the beadle Mahasin receiving\nwages and loaves of bread, and on the reverse side his son is mentioned\namong the boys for whom school fees were paid to a teacher from the\ncommunity chest. We cannot know, of course, how general this prac-\ntice was; it forms an interesting paraliel to practices accepted in our\nown day.\n\nAlthough care for all widows and orphans was one of the main\nconcerns of public charity, many of our lists show that special atten-\ntion was paid to those of community officials. Particularly instructive\nin this respect is B 49 which contains payments just to officials and to\nthe families of defunct employees. Various other documents point in\nthe same direction, such as the one regarding the children of the\nchief rabbi of Alexandria, quoted above (subsection 2, n. 1), or the\none in which the widow of a cantor is granted payment of fees for\nher boy to enable him to learn his father's profession.1s\n\nDid there exist anything resembling a pension for retired officials?\nHere again the copious accounts for the years between 1180 and 1220\nprove to be instructive, In the dated lists for the years 1182-1184 (A\n33, 35 [four entries], and a somewhat later account, A 43), the judge\nJephthah (an exceedingly rare name) receives 20 dirhems per\nmonth.’® In B 40, 41, 79-81, which are later by twenty years, his\nsalary is 6-14 dirhems per week, about 28 a month; but after another\nperiod of twenty years, in A 76-79 (dated 1218) and B 46, 48 (the\nlatter is dated 1219) he gets only 2-14 dirhems a week. The same de-\nvelopment may be observed with regard to his colleague Manasse\n(b. Joseph). He and the judge Samuel b. Saadya receive 20 dirhems\neach month in 1181 (A 25, two entries).

In general, we have to bear in mind that\nthe terms “salary” and ‘‘wages” used here are to be taken with a\ngrain of salt. In theory and practice, these regular payments were\nonly “compensations for loss of time,” '8 whereas work connected\nwith each office and “honoraria” of various kinds constituted the\nmain source of income. The dayyanim, cantors, and beadles had\nregular functions at weddings and funerals, family events on which\nthey probably made more cash than they received from the commu-\nnity chest. Judges normally were also notaries and scribes, and for\neach document they wrote appropriate fees were paid by the parties\nconcerned. When the confidants of the aged Gaon Solomon b. Judah\nadvised him to delegate some of his responsibilities to the president\nof his court, they suggested he let the president have half the revenue\nfrom the slaughterhouses and half that from the fees for issuing legal\ndocuments. Clearly, these were the main regular sources of income\nof the Jewish authorities in Palestine at that time (around 1040).19\nIn all the lists surveyed in our appendixes A and B only one judge\nreceives a decent minimum of a fixed salary: the French rabbi Anatoli\nof Marseille, who served in Old Cairo before becoming Jewish chief\njustice of Alexandria. According to A 43 his salary was 52 dirhems a\nmonth, as against 20 paid to the judge Jephthah and 183, that is, one-\nfourth of the Anatoli’s salary, paid to a teacher. The reason for this\nexceptional treatment is easily understood. Documents were written\nmostly in the Arabic language of which the scholar from France did\nnot have sufficient command. He therefore had to be compensated\notherwise. Moreover, he possibly devoted more time to teaching\nadults than did his colleagues. In B 101 Anatoli receives a payment\nof 8 dirhems from a weekly collection, which would make only 32\ndirhems a month. But this weekly emolument was probably addi-\ntional to his monthly salary.\n\nAs is well known, Maimonides in his Code of Law insists on the\nold religious concept that public service, such as sitting in judgment\nor teaching adults, should be rendered gratuitously.

The peo-\nples of the Western world, particularly Americans, eat comparatively\nlittle bread. In the Middle East, up till recent times, bread was the\nmain human fare. All other foods were combined (in both Arabic\nand Hebrew) in terms for which there is no equivalent in English\nand which mean “that which is taken together with bread.” In both\nlanguages even verbs were formed to express this idea. In Arabic\nadam, in Hebrew lippet, means “taking something as food additional\nto bread.” When a man had bread he had the main component of his\nmeal.

We see here that twice a week, on\nTuesday and Friday the Jewish community of Old Cairo used to\ndistribute between 500 and 600 loaves of bread to about 140 persons\nor households, an average of about 4 loaves for each recipient. Care-\nfully executed lists were kept for each distribution and at the end\nof the month the total expenditure was certified by two social service\nofficers and the scribe who wrote the document (B 24). At that time a\nhundred pounds of bread cost half a dinar, or gold piece (B 19 [TS\nK 15, f. 5], B 24). The standard weight of one loaf of bread was 1\npound, which at that time in Egypt was equivalent to 437.5 grams,\nthat is to say, not much less than the pound in use today in the United\nStates and in England. When the number of recipients was higher\nthan expected (or than provided for by the money available), the\nloaves were made substandard, as in B 24, where 500 pounds were\ndistributed in 559 loaves.\n\nUtmost care was taken 1o ensure that each household received ex-\nactly what it was entitled to, not less, but also not more, as proved by\nthe changes in the rations discernible from week to week and even\nfrom a Tuesday to a Friday. During the first week of November,\n1107, in nineteen out of ninety cases compared, the number of loaves\ndistributed to a household was increased and in four reduced, making\na total of twenty-three adjustments (see table 3 at the end of Appen-\ndix B). In the subsequent week there were three further reductions\nand one more increase. This meticulous care was perhaps prompted\nby religious scruples with regard to the “property of the poor” con-\nfided to its administrators. Anyhow, such minute surveillance must\nhave entailed an enormous amount of work for the parnasim, or so-\ncial service officers.\n\nIn each list, even of consecutive distributions, the names and other\ndesignations of the recipients appear in an entirely different order.\nThe Ram, that is, the poor from Europe, who in three instances are\nlisted together as a separate group, appear in other rolls completely\ndispersed among the rest of the recipients. The arrangement of names\nindicates that the loaves were not distributed to the houses of the\npoor according to a geographical order, but that everyone picked up\nhis share at a storeroom in the synagogue, and whoever came first\nwas listed first.

This assumption seems to be refuted by\nthe carefully written list B 1, where we find, around 1026, 136 bene-\nficiaries receiving a total of about 570 loaves, that is to say, the same\nnumbers that we meet about eighty years later. It stands to reason,\nhowever, that this apparent similarity was merely fortuitous. A large\npart of the Jewish population (and with it the poor) probably moved\nfrom Old to New Cairo between 1026 and 1107, and only the influx\nof refugees from Europe and other countries created the similarity in\nnumber of beneficiaries from the weekly distribution of bread. Atten-\ntion should also be paid to the fact that lists B 1 and B 2a 4 B 52\n(which are two fragments of one sheet) represent only parts of more\nextensive documents, The decline of the community in Old Cairo\nduring the thirteenth century seems to be evident from the quantities\nof bread distributed. It was 150 pounds in B 47 and 100 in B 50 (1241)\nand B 80 (see also B 79 and 81); and, naturally, the poorer sections of\nthe population were slower in moving out of the Old City than those\nenjoying better material conditions.\n\nHow many loaves did each person receive? From B 1, where 121\nhouseholds receive even numbers of loaves and only 10 uneven, it is\nevident that the normal ration was two loaves. One loaf was given to\n*“a stranger” and one to “‘a Muslim,” that is, people who normally did\nnot partake in the distributions. Around 1107 many households re-\nceived uneven numbers of loaves, although those with even numbers\nformed a large majority, and in several instances it is evident that a\nperson got only one loaf each time, as when we find an item “Abra-\nham, his sister and her mother—3\" or “orphans—2\" (B 24, col. 1Ib).\nOn the other hand, persons recognizable as community officials and\ncertain others always received even numbers, which seems to indicate\nthat the persons of these households received two loaves every Tues-\nday and Friday. Obviously, this was the norm, from which only in\ntimes of particular strain was an exception made.\n\nDistributions of wheat—Four loaves of bread weighing a total of\nabout 1,750 grams, or about 4 pounds, is of course not sufficient food\nfor one week.

Both the frequency\nand the scope of these distributions cannot yet be established fully.\nFor the time being, we have explicit relerences only to the doling out\nof wheat before the Passover feast in springtime (C 82a; people baked\ntheir maizot, or unleavened bread, at home) and before the Little\nFast (C 33, July, 1178). But there was certainly an even larger distribu-\ntion bzfore the Great Fast, or Day of Atonement, most of the time\nfalling in September, and there might have been others before the\nremaining holidays and the minor fasts, for “the religious merit of a\nfast is acquired by giving alms,” and holidays could be happy, as the\nBible often reiterates, only when the poor were made happy, too.??\n\nThe unit of wheat handed out to one person was a quarter of a\nwayba (approximately 1 gallon weighing a little over 6 pounds) in\nB 26 and 35, and the double of this quantity in B 66 and 85. The de-\ntailed list B 66, like those of the distribution of loaves, indicates that\ncertain families, especially of communal officials, received more than\ntheir number of members would have warranted.\n\nSome proselytes, presumably Europecans of noble descent, were\napportioned exceptionally high quantities of wheat. My surmise that\nthese persons received special consideration because their eating hab-\nits were so diffcrent from those of the indigenous population® has\nreceived a certain degree of confirmation by a recent, unfortunately\nfragmentary, find. A proselyte expresses in beautiful Hebrew his\nthanks to a distinguished woman, who looked after him, {or the fine\nbread she had sent and gives her instructions how to bake certain\ncakes (“put hot ginger in them”). In the introduction to his letter he\nsays: “When I was holding an office in the vain religion that I fol-\nlowed before, I was served twelve dishes or more, I had every day\n[meat, wine, and so on, and] bread of exquisite taste. I tried {to obtain\nsuch bread] from the day I came to the land of Ishmael [Muslim\ncountries], but was never entirely successful, until I found favor in\nyour eyes. .. .\"24\n\nTaken together, the quantities of bread and wheat did not provide\nmore than mere subsistence at starvation level. No wonder then, that\nthe social service officers tried to supplement the meager rations pro-\nvided by the public funds. In a letter of appointment made in June,\n1099, the beadle of the synagogue of the Iraqis in Old Cairo was\nchareed to help the parnis Eli, one of the signatories of B 24, “with\nthe collection of bread on Friday and other nights.”25 This document\nshows that the parnis made a round on the eve of Sabbath and other\nnights, and when he found persons who had nothing to eat, he col-\n\nGoitein, S.

The year 1026 (see B 1, and\n2a -~ B 52, which are fragments of one sheet) fell in a period of pro-\nlonged hunger and disorders notorious in Egyptian history.?s The\nmany documents made out in or around November, 1107, I linked\nwith the Crusades because of the many refugees from Europe listed in\nthem. It should be noted, though, that no Germanic names appear\namong them. The Riim have either Hebrew names—women included\n(Egyptian Jewesses were never named after biblical heroines)—or\nbear Arabic names, certainly given to them by their environment for\nthe sake of convenience. Occasionally there occur names of Greek or\nRomance origin, preserved in our lists no doubt because the Egyptian\nJews were familiar with them (for example, galina and qali quri,\nGreek kale kore, “pretty girl,”\" and sanyiir, Romanesque senior, all\nin B 26). We are perhaps right in surmising that such detailed lists\nwith changes every three or four days, like those discussed above, were\ndrawn up only in times of scarcity. In normal years perhaps less strict\nprocedures were adopted. Still, this assumption needs to be cor-\nroborated by express evidence.\n\nClothing.—The information about the distribution of clothing is\nvaried, but incomplete. Document B 25 contains two lists of recipients,\none numbering forty-four persons and the other thirty-seven, but it\nbears the mark “Leaf 3,” which suggests that the fragment prescrved\nis the concluding or middle part of accounts for two distributions\namounting to at least three times as many beneficiaries as those whose\nnames are preserved. All the other lists are either partial in character\nor also incomplete.\n\nDistinguished persons received a muqaddar, literally, “valued,”\nwhich, in a previous publication I took to mean that a special esti-\nmate was made for the needs of the beneficiary referred to.2? Since\nthen, I have found in the Geniza a craftsman described as a mugad-\ndari, or maker of muqaddars; thus, the term must denote 2 piece of\nclothing, although it seems not to be mentioned as such anywhere.28\nOne of the meaning of muqaddar in Middle Arabic is “large,” an ap-\npropriate designation for a garment. The assignment of a muqaddar\nis found in B 36 with regard to a respectable visitor from Benha,\nEgypt, and in B 25 (approximately 1105) with reference to the parnas\nfrom Crete and “R.

The allocation\nof a thawb, a gown that covered the whole body and whose standard\nprice was 1 dinar, was entirely exceptional.3®\n\nIt is no surprise that the types of clothing distributed were usually\nof a modest style. The lists mention either felt (B 29 and 33), or, in\nmost cases, a piece of clothing called jiikhaniyya. This term, although\noccurring in the Geniza records more than two hundred times, has not\nyet been traced anywhere else; it is plausible that it was similar to, or\nidentical with the fourteenth-century jikha, a kind of cloak or rain-\ncoat, which al-Magqrizi (d. 1442) reports as worn by Europeans and\nother foreigners, as well as by poor people in Cairo; only later, when\nprices had soared, had respectable persons also begun to use it.3t E.\nAshtor has rightly drawn attention to the fact that high-priced\njitkhaniyyas made of silk, fine linen, or other costly fabrics appear in\nthe lists of trousseaux.32 Thus, the word, although derived from jitkh,\n(woolen) cloth, must designate the cut of the garment concerned, not\nits material. It probably was a robe with a hood, similar to the present-\nday Maghrebi burnous.\n\nIn B 33, fourteen persons receive a fiila, a sari-like cloth, the price\nof which varied widely in accordance with the material used. Respect-\nable beneficiaries received pieces of cloth which they would have\ntailored for themselves according to their own taste (shugqa [B 25\nand 33]). Sometimes a piece of clothing was given to more than one\nperson, “one jiikhaniyya to the orphans of Hiba, the son of the woman\nfrom Europe” (B 36), and in B 25, where bayt, “house,” should per-\nhaps not be taken as “wife, widow,” for in the same list many women\nand widows are explicitly identified as such. Money as an alternative\nfor clothing was sometimes given to more than one person too (“five\ndirhems to the shomér [chap. vi, 10 n. 37] and his son”).\n\nThese monetary compensations had long puzzled me. For when\nwe find, in A 34 (see also B 29 and 36), persons receiving “for cloth-\ning” 5, 4, and even 3, or 2 silver coins, we wonder what kind of\nclothing worth mentioning could be acquired with such small sums.\nThe solution of this puzzle is to be sought in the technique of com-\nmunal finances repeatedly referred to in these pages.

Thus\nwe find Sirb (an exceedingly rare name), the freedwoman, receiving\na jikhaniyya in fall, 1183 (B 36) and only a few months later getting\n5 dirhems “on account of clothing” (A 34). The parnas in charge of\nthe collection cashes 12 dirliems for clothing in one month, and one\nar two months later another 10 (A 34 and 35). It is also noteworthy\nthat in A 34 the freedwoman receives the same sum as the wife of a\nparnas.\n\nMost of the beneficiaries of this charity were women (B 25, 36, 64),\nin accordance with the talmudic injunction and the natural notion\nthat female decency required proper clothing. In some lists (B 33 and\n72) male persons form the majority. Clearly, there were two types of\ndistributions of clothing, one destined mainly for the poor, and an-\nother for the many persons serving the community in one capacity or\nanother.\n\nLodging.—As a rule, free lodging in the houses owned by the com-\nmunity was not among the benefits granted to needy people, at least\nnot in later times. There is in A 149a an exception confirming the\nrule. The decision by the Nagid David I that a teacher was in prin-\nciple entitled to free lodging (A 167) was futile since in the same\nletter he conceded that the person concerned paid rent to the com-\nmunity chest. Many poor families did live in houses belonging to\npious foundations, as we know by the simple fact that many of the\ntenants of these houses appear in the lists of receivers of doles from\nthe community. A closer study of the many references to prices of\nrents found in the Geniza records proves that many of these indigents\nwere paying reduced rents.\n\nPoll tax.—After food, clothing, and housing the most urgent need\nof a member of the minority groups under Islam was money for his\njaliya, or poll tax. Failure to comply with this obligation entailed\nimprisonment, which, because of the bad state of the prisons in those\ntimes, could mean death. It is no exaggeration to say that the largest\nsingle group of requests for help preserved in the Geniza is that for\nassistance to pay the jaliya. This charity, which was regarded as tanta-\nmount to the greatest of all meritorious works, “the ransoming of\nthe captives,” was not left entirely to private initiative, and in certain\nperiods it must have been the main object of communal efforts.

Therefore, the community expected them to\npay whatever they could and made up the rest. The long and highly\ninteresting lists of working people, employees, and persons for whom\nsecurity was given, paying sums ranging from 14 to %4 dinar (B 4.9,\n55, 59), are to be taken as serving such a purpose. Lists of exclusively\nmale persons of low standing (B 11, 53-54, 75) and of prisoners who\ncould be ransomed with comparatively small sums (B 58, see B 96)\nmust also refer to the payment of the poll tax for poor people by the\ncommunity.35\n\nMedical care.—No reference to a Jewish hospital has been found\nthus far in the Geniza. This is somewhat surprising, for many Jewish\ndoctors are mentioned both by the Geniza and in Arabic sources as\nworking in what could be called government hospitals, namely those\nerected by Muslim rulers, whereas Jewish patients are never men-\ntioned in Geniza documents as making use of them.38 On the other\nhand, our records from both the eleventh and the twelfth centuries\nreveal the existence of pious donations for medicines for the needy or\nfor poor sick people in general 37 Physicians treated indigent patients\ngratuitously—if the physicians could be reached by them. Both\nMaimonides and his great-great-grandson David II gave medical ad-\nvice and help to poor persons with whom they had dealings in their\ncapacity as heads of the Jews. Disabled persons of all descriptions are\nmentioned in heavy numbers in the lists of beneficiaries of the com-\nmunity chest. The blind, albeit not appearing in particularly large\nnumbers, seem to have formed a special group, for in an instruction\nto an official with regard to one it is stated that the latter “is of the\nblind and gets his share with them” (B 57a).\n\nEducation.—Education, a big item in the family budget then as it\nis today, was furnished by the Jewish community for the poor and the\norphans (mentioned in this sequence in an instruction by the Nagid\nAbraham Maimonides). Many references to this fact are found in our\nrecords, in particular, details about payments to teachers noted in\nmonthly or weekly accounts.

With this\nshould be compared B 29 (around 1100), where twenty-two persons\nreceive 5 dirhems, and four, 10 dirhems. Similarly, a sick man re-\nceived a monthly payment of 5 dirhems around 1020 (B 57b) and a\nblind woman the same in 1159 (B 68). In three other lists, A 34 and\n35, and B 36 (1180-1183), the groups receiving 5 dirhems are the\nlargest.

Lack of funds was an incentive\nrather than an impediment to travel, for the local communities would\nlodge, feed, and, if necessary, clothe the needy foreigner and finally\nexpedite him to the next place able to take care of him. The Geniza\nabounds in references to this work of charity. In the lists of needy\nreceiving bread, people from outside Old Gairo always form the\nlargest single group. We do not hear much about lodging, because\nthe community possessed houses that were rarely rented out in their\nentirety, as well as several fundugs, or caravanserais.®® Items of ex-\npenditure such as “to a funduq for the lodging of people of Minyat\nGhamr—414 dirhems” (A 43, p. b, 1. 28), are therefore exceptional.5t\n\nOnce having arrived in a place like Old Cairo, the foreigner would\nremain for some time. In A 66-68, a traveler from Toledo, Spain, is\nin receipt of 5 to 6 dirhems a week (to which have to be added cer-\ntainly lodging. as well as rations of bread and probably also of wheat)\nfor at least five consecutive weeks. In several letters far longer periods\nare indicated. If the traveler took ill, a rather common occurrence,\nthe community incurred serious expenses, especially if the patient\nhappened to be a scholarly person. He had to be lodged in a private\nhome, and his food, medicaments, and other needs supplied. The\ncantors, themselves, as the Geniza shows, often widely traveled per-\nsons, usually played host. An extremely interesting, but much dam-\naged, account for one such learned and bedridden foreigner is super-\nscribed “Month of Shevat,” showing that the service was provided for\na period longer than a month.

In the case of a distinguished guest, accompanied by a reti-\nnue, this was a large item of expenditure.5® Sometimes the traveler\nwas in a hurry to catch a caravan, wherefore the community would\nbe asked by the Nagid recommending him to expedite the collection\nin his favor.5* Occasionally, especially when a person of modest status\nwas concerned, the authority taking care of his transportation would\nsee to it that he reached his final destination. For example, after\nhaving arranged for the travel of a poor woman and her infant daugh-\nter from Old Cairo to Alexandria, the Nagid Abraham Maimonides\nasked the community in Alexandria to send her on to Palestine,\nwhere she had a grown-up daughter and some property.5®\n\nWhen a foreigner stayed on for a longer period or for good, work\nhad to be found for him. The fact that so many teachers and cantors\nfrom foreign countries make their appearance in the Geniza docu-\nments might be partly attributable to the difficulty of finding other\noccupations for educated persons without means. In one case, and\nmost appropriately, a newcomer was given the administration of a\ncommunal caravanserai, The relevant document states that he was\nassigned that post in preference to his compatriots arriving with him.\n(But he was a complete failure.)%¢\n\nNaturally, the communities tried to regulate the influx of for-\neigners. A traveler on his way to Jerusalem “from the land of the\nFranks” and making a halt in Old Cairo, was requested by the yeshiva\nfirst to meet with the “distinguished member” Eli b. Amram, upon\nthe receipt of whose report it would be decided whether the pilgrim\nwas welcome in the Holy City. (He obviously intended to settle\nthere.)5? The same dignitary was approached for a cantor from Spain\nwith little children, who was “exiled” from his country (for unstated\nreasons) and had found temporary refuge in a smaller place, but in-\ntended to travel to Fustat.58 A letter dated 1208 reports about a\nMaghrebi who had sojourned in Sicily and had already been main-\ntained by the Alexandrian community for one and a half years, but\nfor whom no new pesiqi could be made since he had relatives in the\ncity, obviously loath to assist him. A circular, signed by the Alex-\nandrian dayyan and six notables requested “the communities” to\nreceive him well, and now the writer of our letter, one of the signa-\ntories of the circular, asks the addressee, the cantor Abu ’I-Majd, who\nalso served as one of the treasurers of the Fustat community, to take\n«care of the foreigner at his arrival in the capital.’®\n\nGoitein, S.

A\nperson captured by pirates first had to be ransomed, which cost 3314\ndinars. Then he had to be given clothing, since his clothes were in-\nvariably taken by the pirates, and he also had to be maintained during\nhis stay in the country and on his way back to his native town. A poll\ntax and a port duty (amounting in one instance to 21 dinars) had to\nbe paid to the Muslim government for him, and, of course, the fare\nof his return journey had to be found: one single captive cost the\ncommunity more than the provision of bread for 150 persons during\ntwo months. How such an emergency was met is vividly illustrated in\na letter from Alexandria. Five captives, still of tender age, had to be\nliberated from the hold of cruel captors. Everyone in the local com-\nmunity, men and women, boys and girls (as the letter emphasizes),\nceased all their regular occupations and devoted themselves entirely\nto the collection of the ransom. Gold, silver, copper, flax, raw and\nspun (for many were flax spinners), household goods, and whatever\nhad any value were brought together, until the young prisoners were\nfreed. “The gentiles were astonished in the face of such sacrifices for\nentirely strange persons and said: ‘Blessed is the people that is of\nsuch a condition. Yea, blessed is the people, whose God is the Lord’ ”\n(Psalm 144:15). The ecumenical aspect of this type of charity has been\nemphasized in subsection [, above.%®\n\nOn top of all these recurrent and often so exacting demands on\nprivate and communal generosity there occasionally occurred a disas-\nter, the consequences of which could be overcome or mitigated only\nby extraordinary efforts. In the Geniza period we first have the de-\nstruction of the Christian 2nd Jewish houses of worship in and around\nthe year 1012, which took decades to rebuild; then came the devasta-\ntion of Palestine by bedouins and Seljuks and, later on, the capture\nof Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099. The Geniza proves that the\nJewish population of the Holy City was not entirely annihilated, as\nbelieved before, but that a refugee problem was created, to be solved\nin ways astonishingly similar to familiar procedures.®* When Jerusa-\nlem was recaptured by Saladin in 1187, strenuous efforts were made\nto restore the Jewish houses of worship and learning. Finally, in 1265,\nwhen Sultan Baybars threatened to burn the Christians and Jews of\nCairo, but converted the punishment into an exorbitant fine, the\nJewish communities of the Egyptian RIf exerted themselves in help-\ning their brethren in the capital to bear a burden they were unable\nto shoulder alone.

Epilogue: An Appraisal of the Social Services\n\nAl-Muqaddasi, the renowned Muslim geographer, writing around\n985, praises the people of Old Cairo for their spirit of charity and\nliberality. His praise, I presume, was meant for the Muslims of that\ncity. But minority groups tend to compete with their environment in\nsuch matters, as may be observed in our own times nearer home.l\n\nWith this testimony, given at the beginning of the classical Geniza\nperiod, may be compared another one, given at its end. In a letter\naddressed to Fustat the Nagid Joshua (1310-1355) says: “The repute\nof the noble community for their works of charity and good deeds is\ngreat near and afar.” These words do not represent merely an attempt\nat captivating the benevolence of the addressees, for on other occasions\nJoshua did not spare words of criticism and even reproach.2 May 1\nremark in passing that al-Muqaddasi and the Nagid use the same word\nfor charity: sadaga-sedaga.\n\nIt should be noted also that Egypt, during the Fatimid and Ayyubid\nperiods, served as a refuge for people in distress all over the world, as\nabundantly demonstrated in Appendix B. All this taken together\npermits us to conclude that the social services, as illustrated by the\ndocuments discussed, represent at least a good average of what was\ncommon usage in that respect in the High Middle Ages.\n\nThe vagaries of preservation must be blamed for a certain distor-\ntion of the picture to be abstracted from appendixes A-C. A dispropor-\ntionally high percentage of our information dates from the thirteenth\ncentury, a period of complete decay for the Fustat Jewish com-\nmunity.? The decline set in during the twelfth century, presumably\ncaused by the exodus to New Cairo and by other, secondary, circum-\nstances, and was subsequently accelerated by a catastrophe of unusual\nproportions. Therefore, while examining the efficacy of the social\nservices of the Fustat community one must always keep in mind that\n\nGoitein, S. D.

For instance, it might have been\nwritten in time of emergency and under specific conditions, a possi-\nbility weighed above (p. 130). On the other hand, fragmentary sources\noften are apt to provide us with a wealth of information. Thus, even\nthough none of the lists from the first third of the eleventh century\nare complete, they nevertheless tell us a story of no small dimensions\nabout works of charity.

In\na letter written at the time of the sultan al-Malik al-‘Adil (d. 1218),\nthe Nagid Abraham Maimonides is accused of having urged “the\nwhole community, almost 200 persons” to sign a petition to the sul-\ntan in his favor.? While a number written in such a context might\nlend itself to various interpretations, it must be regarded as reflecting\na certain reality, for its recurs again in C 55, issued about twenty\nyears later (around 1235). In an emergency appeal to the community\na sum of 300-500 dirhems is requested, to which this note is attached:\n“But how can this be done, seeing that the number of male adults in\nFustat today does not even reach 200\" (each adult was expected to\npay only 1 dirhem). The number of contributors was indeed “less\nthan 200\" (about 165 men, representing around 80 households). In\nthe somewhat earlier list C 50 the names of 214 donators are still\nreadable, and not many more were included, but here (C 50) several\npersons give together with unnamed others, and, unlike C 55, the\nyounger members of a household do not appear. Therefore, in the\ninterval between C 50 and C 55 an additional marked deterioration\nmust have taken place. On the other hand the numerous communal\naccounts from that period (1220-1240) show a rather steady average\nof 35-45 relief recipients.19\n\n‘What was the cause of this steep decline in the size of the com-\nmunity between C 30 and C 50 and 55? The pillage and conflagration\nof Fustat in December, 1168, which was often described as fatal to\nthat city, seems not to have affected to an appreciable degree: the\nquarters inhabited mainly by Jews. The fifty documents or so from\nthe period 1168 to 1200 presented in appendixes A-C testify to a\nrather vigorous communal life. In B 74, which we assume dates from\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century, around 135 households were\nstill on the relief rolls of the Fustat community.\n\nThe turning point, it seems, was the devastating famine and plague\nof 1201-1202, so movingly described by contemporary Muslim writ-\ners 1 and referred to also in the Geniza documents. Perhaps half, if\nnot more, of the Jewish population was wiped out, and since Fustat\nhad already lost its role of leading city to New Cairo, it was unable to\nrecover from that blow. Like the town itself, the Jewish community\nlingered on through the centuries. At the beginning of the fourteenth\ncentury there were still about 115 persons vowing donations for a\nforeigner on a single day (C 68), and 108 members made their yearly\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Hananya (1140-1159) and Abraham\nMaimonides (1205-1237), for both of which we possess comparatively\nrich documentation, there was one relicf recipient to cvery four\ncontributors to the charities of the Jewish community of Fustat—\na very heavy load, especially if we remember that a paterfamilias\nusually presided over a large household.

There is\nample evidence in the Geniza that Maimonides’ admonition (which\nis based on a talmudic precept) was followed by many of his contem-\nporaries.13 It applied, though, mainly to relatives, friends, colleagues,\nor “sons of good families,” who had not yet “uncovered their faces”\nby accepting alms or other relief in public. Those who had, belonged\nto the mass of ‘aniyyim (Heb.), “the poor,” who were almost a people\nby themselves, whom one was obliged to support, but who could not\nexpect to be extricated from their poverty. God is the maker of rich\nand poor (Proverbs 22:2). “You must heip the poor in proportion to\nhis needs, but you are not obliged to make him rich.” 1* Poverty is\nordained by God; you may mitigate its evil consequences, but you\ncannot succeed in rooting it out altogether.

And I suspect that those long, calligraphic lists of contributors,\nwhich were suspended in the synagogue for public examination and\nalso as incentive to further liberality, had an additional purpose: they\nwere destined for God, who, while inspecting his synagogue, should\nsee, black on white, what pious and charitable people were coming\nto pray in his house.\n\nLast, but not least: private munificence competed with communal\ncharity. With the exception of collections, made on extraordinary\noccasions, only relatively small sums were donated in response to\npublic appeals or as regular contributions to a synagogue. Liberality\nwas a virtue, best to be displayed in splendid isolation. While the\nbasic needs of the mass of the poor were satisfied by the social services\ndescribed in this section, special cases of want or misfortune—and\nhow numerous they werel—as a rule sought relief in private help.\nThe Geniza teems with letters illustrating this situation.

        "text": "144 Worship v,D, L, a\n\nstate law. The tens of thousands of Americans who have worked in\nSaudi Arabia since the inception of the oil industry in that country\nhave never been allowed to build a church for themselves.!\n\nAs a matter of fact, numerous churches and synagogues existed in\nFustat and Baghdad at a time when the power of Islam was at its\nheight, and even (New) Cairo, which was founded as late as 969, soon\nhad its churches and synagogues.? Therefore, it has been said that the\nlaw banning non-Islamic houses of worship was honored more in the\nbreach than in its execution,® but this statement is misleading. The\nmore distinguished churches and monasteries in Fustat and Baghdad\nwere pre-Islamic, while the new non-Muslim houses of devotion had\nto be modest and inconspicuous in order not to arouse the fanaticism\nof zealots. A Geniza letter reports, indeed, that the renovated part of\na kanisa (referring, it seems, to a church, and not a synagogue) had to\nbe pulled down because it was higher than a nearby mosque.* The\nsynagogue architecture as reflected in the Geniza records has to be\njudged in the light of this situation.\n\nThe most striking difference between the structure of a church or\nsynagogue on the one hand and a mosque on the other was a gallery\nfor women in the former. Islam was uneasy about the presence of\nwomen in the mosque and for the most part banished them from its\nhouses of worship altogether. In the Temple of Jerusalem, it seems,\nwomen were separated from men only on special occasions of popular\nentertainment rather than during acts of devotion. But in the ancient\nsynagogues of Calilee were found structures that have been inter-\npreted by experts as women’s galleries, and the American excavators\nof the magnificent synagogue of Sardis in Asiz Minor provide the\nsame explanation for their own finds. (The excavations are still in\nprogress.) 8 This interpretation is corroborated by the testimony of\nthe Cairo Geniza records. In the synagogues of both the Palestinians\nand Iragians in Old Cairo, as well as in the holy shrine of Dammiih\nnear Gizeh on the western bank of the Nile, there was a women’s\ngallery, called bayt al-nisa’, “the place for women.” It was reached by\na staircase leading up from a special entrance, called bab al-sirr, “the\nsecret door,” or bab al-nis@’, “women’s door,” which faced a side street\nleading to the thoroughfare, to which the main gate of the synagogue\nopened.\n\nThis separation, however, did not prevent women and men from\nmeeting before, and, we may imagine, particularly after prayer. In a\nletter to a sick woman, a man (most probably a relative) refers to a\nconversation held “when I met you last in the synagogue,”® which\ncould mean only: in the lane, or rather, court, fronting the building.\n\nGoitein, S.

Occasional references to the subject are found in many\nGeniza records. The actual building of the synagogue of the Pales-\ntinians (in which the Geniza was preserved) was described in detail\nby that excellent traveler Jacob Saphir, who visited it in 1859 during\nits first “restoration,” second by Alfred J. Butler in his book, Ancient\nCoptic Churches of Egypt ([Oxford, 1884], pp. 169-170), and finally\nby Jack Mosseri, a prominent member of the Cairene Jewish commu-\nnity who also sketched how the synagogue looked before 1890, when\nit was pulled down and replaced by another building.?\n\nAccording to Butler, the main hall of the synagogue was about 65\nfeet long and 35 feet wide. It consisted of a nave and two aisles, the\naisles, according to Saphir, divided from the nave by six columns on\neach side (just as in the synagogue of Sardis mentioned above, which\nwas, however, approximately twice as large). This description tallies\nwith the accounts of building materials acquired for the reconstruc-\ntion of 1039-1040, and with other references in the Geniza records.\nThe columns supported the women’s gallery, which was made of\ntimber. A large white column supported the middle part of the gal-\nlery between the southwestern ends of the two aisles, its large base\nstill visible in Mosseri’s sketch as “memorial stone.” There is also a\nreference to columns within the women'’s gallery.\n\nThe repair of a glass window cost 1 dirthem in 1181. No other\ndetails about the number and look of the windows have been found\nthus far. The term used, td@qa, seems to indicate that at least their\nupper part was rounded.®\n\nThe synagogue of the Palestinians, as well as that of Minyat Zifta\nin the Nile Delta, was covered with a gamaliin, or gable roof. The\nconstruction of a pitched roof over a comparatively broad room was\nless expensive than a durable flat ceiling; perhaps, also, it was found\nthat it made for better acoustics. The nave of the Abii Sargah church,\nsituated in the immediate vicinity of the synagogue of the Pales-\ntinians, was also covered with a pointed roof.\n\nThe holy ark, which contains the Torah scrolls, was a piece of\nmasonry in front of the basilica, elevated and flanked by columns,\nlike the sanctuary in the Coptic church.

Thus it stands to reason that the term, together\nwith the architectural features, was borrowed from Coptic haykal,\nsanctuary, although the latter term was ultimately derived from the\nHebrew Bible. In the synagogue of Hebron, which was rebuilt at the\nend of the eleventh century, the ark was situated between the two\nentrance gates. This arrangement goes back to the tripartite doorway\n(one main and two side entrances) found in the wall facing Jerusalem\nin the ancient synagogues of Galilee, such as those of Capernaum,\nChorasin, and Beth Shearim. At that time, the ark was still a wooden\nchest and not a stone structure, and a tripartite portal was, of course,\na common feature of Hellenistic architecture. It is not excluded that\nin the synagogue of the Palestinians in Old Cairo the wall facing\nJerusalem originally had the same arrangement as that attested in a\nGeniza letter for the contemporary synagogue of Hebron, since the\nmain street passed immediately before the northeastern wall. When,\nafter the bitter experience of 1012, the synagogue was rebuilt, we may\nassume that the two entrances flanking the holy ark and opening to\nthe main street were closed, and only one entrance, that on the south-\nwest side opposite the holy ark, was left.\n\nIn a letter dated 1033 a man contributes 10 dinars for the erection\nof an ark in the synagogue of the Palestinians in Alexandria. An in-\nscription from the same town, dated 1879, states that the donor had\ngiven the money for the columns and the lintel at the entrance of\nthe ark sanctuary. A pair of curtains, described in one document as\ngreen divided the ark from the rest of the building, and a silver lamp\nwas suspended “in” the ark, that is, between the chest containing the\nTorah scrolls and the curtains. Both features were common in the\nsanctuaries of the Coptic churches.\n\nThere is still another constructional detail that the synagogue\nseems to have borrowed from the church: the raised platform in the\nmiddle of the building, on which the Scripture lections and certain\nparts of the liturgy were read. Solemn processions, preceded by a par-\nticularly holy Torah scroll and moving from the ark to the platform\nand back, were ancient custom in the synagogue of the Palestinians.?\nIn talmudic times reference is made frequently to a reader’s platform,\ncalled béma (a Greek word), but this was a piece of wooden furniture\nthat could be moved around. In the Geniza period, we have instead a\nfixed structure made of masonry, called anbél, none other than the\nLatin-Greek-Coptic term ambon(e) still designating the same object\nin the Coptic church.

The Geniza also\ncontains a reference to the taqat al-anbél, the niche in the platform,\nwhich was large enough to harbor a Torah scroll. There was perhaps\nno particular reason for mentioning the columns, although in the\nnearby Mu‘allaqa church (pre-Islamic and still extant) the eleven\ncolumns of the ambon had symbolic meaning, representing the disci-\nples of Jesus (twelve less Judas Iscariot).’! Liturgical texts from the\nGeniza, edited recently, show that the anb6l was used for the chanting\nof special sections of the service and the reading of the lections, but\nnot for the recitation of the regular prayers. Keeping in mind, too,\nthat those liturgical texts contain such Greek words as kyrios, “Lord,”\nand eleison, *have mercy”—familiar to the churchgoer up to the pres-\nent day—one is inclined to assume that the introduction of the ambon\ninto the synagogue meant more than merely the adoption of a struc-\ntural detail.\"*\n\nIn general, the relationship of synagogue and church, as far as the\narchitecture of the house of worship is concerned, was reciprocal:\noriginal Jewish, or rather Hellenistic-Jewish, features were taken over\nby the Christians, and, later on, came back to the Jews in a more\ndeveloped form. It is worthy of note that “hékhal” has remained the\nterm for the holy ark among the Oriental Jewish communities, while\nthe foreign word ‘“anbsl,” although used throughout the Geniza\nperiod in both documentary and literary sources, passed entirely into\noblivion.\n\nOwing to the caprices of cultural shifts and language history the\nMuslim term for pulpit, al-minbar, became the generally used desig-\nnation for the elevated platform in the synagogue in all Christian\ncountries (pronounced almemar or similarly, while the Hebrew term\nmigdal remained confined to learned books). In the Geniza the word\n“al-minbar” practically never occurs. In the one case I have noted, it\nis used in the plural and in a way that shows that it did not belong\nto the daily speech of the Egyptian Jews in that time.13\n\nVarious sections of the synagogue of the Palestinians in Old Cairo,\nparticularly the entrance to the ark and to the aisles, were decorated\nwith exquisite woodwork.

Kahle, in his book The Cairo Geniza reports as a fact (pp.\n3-4) that the building housing the synagogue of the Palestinians was\nnone else but the building of St. Michael’s church which the Jacob-\nite patriarch had sold to the Jews in 882 when he was forced to pay a\ntribute of twenty thousand dinars to the ruler of Egypt Ahmad b.\nTultin. This view was shared by all scholars connected in any way\nwith Geniza studies, including myself, and I still took it for granted\nwhen writing my article “The Synagogue Building and Its Furnish-\nings,” Eretz-Israel 7 (1964). Subsequent research, made during the\nprinting of that article, convinced me, however, that this assumption\nwas unfounded, and in a postscript to the English summary of that\narticle I expressed the view that the church building was acquired\nby the Jewish newcomers from Iraq, who wished to have a synagogue\nof their own, whereas the synagogue of the Palestinians was the origi-\nnal and pre-Islamic Jewish place of worship.\n\nAn attentive reading of the Muslim antiquarians describing the\nchurches and synagogues of Fustat confirms this opinion. Maqrizi\nsays (II, 494): “Michael, the patriarch of the Jacobites, sold the\nchurch in the vicinity of the Mu‘allaqa [church] to the Jews,” and\nIbn Dugmiq describes (IV, 108) the synagogue of the Iraqians with\nexactly the same topographic definition as being “in the vicinity of\nthe Mu‘allaqa,” while assigning another site to the synagogue of the\nPalestinians. According to Maqrizi (11, 471), the door of the synagogue\nof the Palestinians bore an inscription carved in wood saying that it\nwas built in the year 330 of the Seleucid era (a.n. 18-19) which, ac-\ncording to Magqrizi’s informants meant: prior to the destruction of\nthe Temple of Jerusalem by Titus and 621 years before the rise of\nIslam. Various explanations for this date have been tried. Anyhow,\nlocal tradition clearly stated that the Palestinian synagogue was pre-\nIslamic and had been erected in gray antiquity whereas the Iragian\none had formerly been a church.\n\nButler confirms this view in his book on ancient Goptic churches\n\nGoitein, S.

Naturally, the\nsynagogue of the Palestinians did not serve as a model for church\narchitecture. But, built during the Christian era of Egypt, it followed\nthe pattern of the houses of worship then in vogue—as it did with\nregard to the details of ambon and ark discussed above. It preserved,\nhowever, the original plan in a purer form, because no substantial\nstructural changes were necessary since the additional synagogues of\nthe Iraqians and of the Karaites took care of the increase in popula-\ntion, the major part of which anyhow later moved to Cairo, the new\ncapital nearby.\n\nButler regarded the wood carvings of dovelike birds, which were\nstill in existence at the time of his visit, as an indication of the origi-\nnally Christian character of the building. But much has been learned\nabout wood carvings in the Fatimid period since Butler’s time. Dec-\norations with dovelike and other birds were common in secular as\nwell as in religious buildings, and in general there was no marked\ndifference in decorative wood carving among the various religions or\nbetween religious and secular purposes. In short, the synagogue of\nthe Palestinians in Fustat must be regarded as a pre-Islamic building,\nmuch influenced by the Christian environment in its general layout\nand architectural details, but destined from the outset to serve as a\nJewish house of worship.13\n\nb. THE FURNISHINGS OF THE SYNAGOGUE\n\nUnlike the mosque, where prayer is short and consists mostly of\nprostrations, genuflections, and other bodily movements, the service\nof the synagogue is protracted even on workdays and requires that\nthe congregation be seated most of the time. According to the seating\nhabits of that period, pews or chairs were not used for the purpose.\nInstead, the synagogue was covered with mats and carpets, while the\nindividual members would bring in cushions to sit and to recline on.\n\nIn addition to occasional references, our knowledge of the syna-\ngogue furnishings during the Geniza period is derived mainly from\ninventories drawn up either when a new beadle was appointed or\nwhen the pieces remaining after a sack of the city or a similar disaster\nwere counted. Such lists have been preserved from the years 1075,\n1080, 1095-1096, 1099, 1159, 1181, and 1186.

Also, a synagogue usually had more than one\nbeadle, each seemingly responsible for only some of the furnishings.\n\nNext to seating facilities, that is, mats and carpets, the illumina-\ntion of the synagogue looms large in our documents. Monthly ac-\ncounts of expenditure on olive and linseed oil are extremely common\nand could be used with profit by anyone studying the history of\nlighting. Detailed lists of the lighting appliances used are found in\nthe records from the years 1075 and 1080, that is, shortly after the\ngreat sack of the Egyptian capital by the Turkish mercenaries, when\neven the palaces of the caliph were plundered and the fabulous\n“treasures of the Fatimids” were dispersed. A remark in a contem-\nporary letter, “I was shocked when I learned what happened to the\nsynagogue of the Palestinians,” indicates that it did not escape the\ngeneral devastation. Not a single silver lamp is mentioned in those\nlists, not even the one hanging in the holy ark according to an earlier\ndocument. On the other hand, the number and types of lighting im-\nplements referred to are rather impressive. In 1075, the synagogue of\nthe Palestinians was illuminated by fifty-one large and small chan-\ndeliers, called bitgandalat i.e., abii gandaldt), a term not found thus\nfar elsewhere, as well as by thirty bronze lamps. In 1080, the syna-\ngogue of the Babylonians possessed twenty-five lamps with grillwork\n—a type common in those days, according to the admirable study on\nthe subject by D. S. Rice. ¢ In addition, there were lamps in bronze\nand iron, three bronze “scorpions,” or hooks, with “shells” (presum-\nably implements similar to the latter-day Sabbath lamp), brass bowls,\nthirty “open” chandeliers and seventeen with grillwork, a chandelier\nwith three “columns,” that is, metal rods instead of chains, a chan-\ndelier with a long chain and a “scorpion,” and, finally a sanbtisaqa,\nor triangle, as well as a hoop, both serving as bearers of candles.”\n\nA hundred years later, in the list of 1181, no biiqandalat, or chan-\ndeliers, are mentioned anymore. “Saucers,” atbdqg, that is, flat lamps,\nwere preferred at that time, presumably because they were easier to\nclean of oil rests than deep lamps. The Babylonian beadle received\ninto his custody thirty-seven such “saucers,” as well as “scorpions.”\nTwo silver lamps with chains of silver were among the treasures of\nthe Babylonian synagogue preserved in the compound of the Pales-\ntinians in 1159,\n\nThe synagogues were particularly rich in precious textiles, which\nserved mostly for the decoration of its walls and columns.!8 Murals,\n\nGoitein, S.

On the other hand, hangings\nwere a decoration common even in private homes. The material\nespecially cherished was siglaton, a famous medieval fabric of heavy\ndamask, which, in the synagogue inventories, is invariably of two\ncolors, such as light green with blue-black, or white with black or\nred. Sometimes it was decorated with stripes of gold and silver. Bro-\ncade is also well represented. Of particular luxury were the covers\nfor the Torah, the scroll containing the five books of Moses, and the\nHaftara, the lections from the Prophets. Naturally, a cover was spread\nover the tévd, or desk on which the scrolls were laid, when they were\nchanted. The inventories include also other utensils, such as reading\nstools, kursi, and a prayer mantle, #zdr, to be worn by the kohens\nwhile pronouncing the priestly blessing.\n\nThe most honored possessions of any synagogue were its Torah\nscrolls and books. In 1075, after the great sack of the Egyptian capital,\nthere were eighteen Torah scrolls in the synagogue of the Palestin-\nians, of which, however, some belonged to the Babylonians and to the\nholy shrines of Dammiih and Tatay. No ornaments are mentioned at\nall, only three copper cases for the scrolls, while the rest were of wood.\nIn 1159, an inventory notes cases of silver and of wood coated with\nsilver, as well as many other silver ornaments, namely, “crowns” and\n“pomegranates,” the latter being grillwork decorations covering the\nheads of the two rods on which a scroll is fastened. Most of these\nsilver ornaments were either “burnt with gold” (gilded), or “glued\nwith blackness” (embellished with niello work).1® Processions in\nwhich the Torah scrolls, clad in precious textiles and crowned with\ntheir silver or gold ornaments, were carried from the holy ark to the\nanbbdl, or central platform, and back formed one of the highlights of\nthe synagogue service (see sec. D, 2, n. 9, below).\n\nAs for books, the synagogues were exceedingly eager to acquire old\ncodices, written by famous scribes, or, at least, copies of such codices,\ndesignated as their “brothers.” Utmost care was taken to read the\nHoly Scriptures in the correct pronunciation and with the traditional\nsingsong or cantillation that fixed the tone appropriate for each word\n(cf. the neumes in the church music of the Middle Ages).?

The\nmany new codices dedicated to the synagogue of the Palestinians, as\nevident from the later lists, seem to point to a catastrophe destroying\nmuch of the old fund and requiring quick replacement. On the other\nhand, in the course of that century the synagogue was enriched by\nthe most precious treasures: the manuscripts looted by the Crusaders\nat the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 and sold by them afterward to\nthe Jews of Egypt. Some of these treasures are still in existence, well\npreserved in public libraries in Europe, the United States, and Israel.\nSince the synagogues had no pews or other furniture where one\ncould keep one’s own books used during the services and since Bible\ncodices were heavy, the weekly Torah lections were copied separately\nin small booklets that could be carried easily by the worshipers. This\ncustom gave the more opulent members of a congregation an oppor-\ntunity to vie with each other in the acquisition of precious copies of\nholy texts. An outstanding example is the weekly lection of Numeri,\nchapters 18-15, written in 1106-1107, most probably in Fustat, by\nIsaac b. Abraham ha-Levi. It is remarkable both for its precious read-\nings and its artistic execution. The talmudic injunction “beautify\nyourself before God with good works” was understood also in the\nsense that the things used in God’s service should excel in beauty.?!\n\n€. THE SYNAGOGUE COMPOUND\n\n“There is no instance of 2 sacred edifice standing clear and de-\ntached like an English church in its churchyard. A Coptic church\noutside never shows any outline: around it is huddled a mass of\nhaphazard buildings which show that the architect’s idea was con-\ncealment of the exterior rather than adornment.” This “entangle-\nment of the sacred fabric in other buildings, wall against wall,”\ndescribed by Butler as a distinctly Coptic peculiarity, was also char-\nacteristic of the synagogue during the period illustrated by the Geniza\nrecords.?? The very term “the synagogue” was not confined to the\nplace in which the prayers were held, but comprised the whole sur-\nrounding compound, all of it being its property. We read about a\nhouse adjoining, mulazig (lit., “cleaving to”) the synagogue, others\nadjacent to its vestibule, dihliz, or to its sukka (hut for the Feast of\nTabernacles), or to “the women'’s entrance.” Mentioned is the living\nquarters, sukn, of a man, or the apartment, fabaga, of another “in the\nsynagogue,” meaning, of course, one of the buildings in its immediate\nvicinity.

Maimonides, who was asked whether\nthis was proper, decided that the room immediately above the holy\nark should not be used as a bedroom or as a workshop.?® The syna-\ngogue compound had two special designations: jiwar al-kanis, liter-\nally, “neighborhood of the synagogue,” and rub‘ al-kanis, which,\nalthough pronounced thus, seems not to have had the meaning “quar-\nter,” as in classical Arabic, but that of rab’, “‘area, residence.”\n\nThe clustering of houses around a synagogue or Coptic church\nserved various purposes. 1t was a protective measure, aimed at con-\ncealing a building apt in times of tension to become a target of\nattacks by fanatics of the ruling religion. This defensive, negative aim\nwas secondary, though, and of a later date. Originally, proximity to\nGod's sanctuary was sought to derive blessing from it. “I want to live\nin the neighborhood of the synagogue” writes one man. A woman\nwho was to be evicted from one of the houses adjoining the synagogue\nsays in her complaint to a Nagid that her sole satisfaction in life was\nlistening to the antiphonies carried over to her from the service. The\nofficials of the synagogue lived “in” it, meaning in the surrounding\nbuildings, just as the Coptic monks had their living quarters next to\nthe church. Morcover, the synagogue compound served many needs\nthat in ancient times and in small places were met by the synagogue\nbuilding itself.\n\nThe rabbinical court held its sessions in the synagogue. Since an\nentry in an account mentions repairs “in the room of the judge in\nthe synagogue,” we may conclude that he had an office there or in\none of the buildings adjoining it. Classes for schoolchildren, so far\nas they were not held in houses rented by teachers or in private\nhouses, took place in synagogues. In those times schoolchildren were\ncalled “synagogue boys.” Adults, too, studied in the synagogue, espe-\ncially at night, on the Sabbath, and on holidays. Whether all these\nactivities went on in the hall destined for communal prayer or in\nadjacent rooms or buildings is not evident from our sources in each\nindividual case.!\n\nThe synagogue also served as a hospice for needy travelers and\naliens. “I found two foreigners in the synagogue” writes a visitor of\nBilbays in Lower Egypt. “The proselyte and the man from Aleppo,\nwho live in the synagogue of the Babylonians,” and “the woman\nwhose dwelling place is in the synagogue of the Palestinians” are\nmentioned in lists of indigent persons.

One Karaite scholar went so far as to decry the worshipful\nreverence shown to the holy ark and the Torah scrolls as outright\nidolatry.\n\nFor the popular religion, as evidenced in the Geniza papers, the\nsynagogue was a house of meeting both with God and with one’s fel-\nlowmen. When the holy ark was opened and the Torah scrolls were\nexposed to the eyes of the worshiper, he felt himself transported to\nthe presence of God. In a time of great danger, a man tells us in 2\nGenira letter, he went to the synagogue, opened the ark, and rolled\nhimself on the floor beneath it, showing in this way his utmost con-\ntrition and humiliation before God and his need for heavenly inter-\nvention. He was saved and “both Jews and Muslims were happy\nabout this and congratulated me. It was a glorious day because God\nhad shown mercy upon us all. He had heard my prayer and had\nnoticed my fasting and how [ rolled myself beneath the holy ark.” !\n\nThe oath on the Bible, in our courts a mere formality, was in those\ndays regarded as an almost physical citation of God as witness and\nwas, therefore, administered in the synagogue in front of the open\nark and Torah scrolls. These ceremonial trappings were believed to\nbe so essential that we find a query addressed to Maimonides whether\nan oath on a codex of the Bible (and not before a scroll) was legally\nbinding.2 In short, the synagogue was revered as a “sanctuary” of\nGod and called thus. To be sure, nowhere in the Geniza records is a\nsynagogue designated as “temple,” a modern innovation that would\nhave been regarded by the Jews of that period as blasphemy.?\n\nAt the same time the synagogue served so many cultural and com-\nmunal purposes that its character as a house of worship became\nblurred. Unlike the mosque, where, in prayer, all present turned\ntoward Mecca, that is, to God, the members of the congregation in\nthe synagogue sat along the walls or before them facing one another,\nthus always being conscious of their fellowmen. Abraham Maimo-\nnides, the pietist reformer (1186-1237), tried to change the arrange-\nments of sitting in the synagogue to resemble those prevailing in the\nmosque and to do away with the comfortable cushions and reclining\npillows inconsistent with the duties of “a slave in the presence of his\nmaster.” 4 He was not successful.

In Islam, too, there were many complaints that\nthe mosque served too many secular purposes, so much so that the\nprophet Muhammad was credited with having said: “At the end of\nthe days, people will enter the mosques and sit in them in circles,\nspeaking about worldly things and loving this world. Do not join\ntheir circles, lor God has no use for them.” 5 Still, for reasons ex-\nplained below, the difference between Jewish and Muslim worship\nwas marked and caused much heart-searching for pious Jews.\n\nOn workdays, Jewish services were held three times daily. The\nMuslims pray five times. Their prayer, however, is incomparably\nshorter than the Jewish, and although Islam, too, prefers attendance\nat public service to private prayer, the synagogue was far more insis-\ntent in this respect. In a letter from Messina, Sicily, which had at that\ntime only a small Jewish community, a traveler passing through that\ntown writes to his father that it was impossible to live there since only\none service was held in the local synagogue during a working day.®\n\nOn Mondays and Thursdays, when a ‘Torah scroll was taken out\nand a section of the weekly lection read in public, attendance seems\nto have been general. There are many references in the Geniza papers\nto happenings during or after the services on Monday and Thurs-\nday. A scholar from Byzantium or western Europe, on return to his\ncountry, promises his Egyptian benefactor that he would arrange for\nprayers to be held for the Jatter’s welfare in the synagogues on Mon-\ndays and Thursdays in all the congregations of the land of Edom\n(i.e., “the Roman empire”).” A similar promise is mentioned as car-\nried out in a letter from Ramle, Palestine, to Old Cairo. The writer\nhad returned from a journey to Acre and Tyre and asserts that he\nsaid prayers for his benefactor on these days (while the ark stood\nopen) and praised his munificence toward him and others.? When a\nman had a portentous dream (Moses and A[aron] sitting in judgment\n—the document is fragmentary), he repeated the dream on a Monday\nand a Thursday in the synagogue of the Palestinians, most probably\nin order to evoke penitence.? In order to force a guest from Jerusalem\nto retract an accusation made against him, a worshiper in the syna-\ngogue of the Palestinians in Old Cairo swore during a Thursday\nmorning service “by the Torah scroll, by all his possessions, and by\nthe head of the sultan” that he would not allow the guest to leave\nthe city before he had given him satisfaction.

On Sabbath and\nholy days four services were held; the readings from the Scriptures\ntook up a long time, the more so as they were translated verse by\nverse into Aramaic, a language that had been the international means\nof communication throughout southwestern Asia before the Islamic\nconquest. By the time of the Geniza period, Aramaic had become ob-\nsolete and even scholars were less familiar with it than with Hebrew.\nStill, the old custom of reading the translation into that idiom was\nretained, and even boys were trained to recite the “Targim.”13 Most\nlikely they did it with the same breathtaking speed as the boys in\nsome old-fashioned Yemenite synagogues in Jerusalem still do.\n\nAfter the morning service and before the reading of the Scriptures\n(not after it, as was customary in later times), was delivered a sermon,\nmore exactly a derdsh, a combination of sermon, lecture, and disputa-\ntion.} Moreover, in the time left free by the services, another derash\nwould be read, either by a guest lecturer for the general public, to be\nattended by people from various synagogues, or by a scholar for a\nselect group, to which special invitations, calligraphically written,\nwere sent to the notables of the community.

The word is derived from Greek poet(es) and is pre-Islamic.\nIn Arabic these poetical pieces are called hizina, because it was this\npart of the service in which the hazzan, or cantor, the professional\nsinger, had to prove his mettle. The biblical exhortation “Sing unto\nthe Lord a new song” (Psalm 98:1), echoed in the talmudic injunc-\ntion “Everyone is obliged to say something new in his prayer every\nday,” was still taken seriously in the Geniza period, which had been\npreceded by five hundred years of exuberant production of liturgical\npoetry. Tens of thousands (perhaps over a hundred thousand) of\nleaves covered with religious poems have been found in the Geniza,\ntestifying to the stupendous output of the more famous liturgical\npoets of old as well as to the large number of authors, often entirely\nunknown otherwise, who were active in this field.1?\n\nThis wide diffusion and use of the piyy@t in the synagogue service\nposes a problem. The Hebrew language of these poems is extremely\nelaborate and involved so that the poems cannot be understood\nproperly without a good knowledge of rabbinical lore and law and a\ncomplete mastery of the text of the Bible. Even a modern scholar,\nequipped with dictionaries and reference books of ail kinds, is some-\ntimes at a loss to understand their correct meaning. Thus, one won-\nders for whom these creations were destined, particularly since they\nusually consisted of a circle of poems whose full recitation required\nhours. It must have been the melodies with which the piyyit was\nsung which formed its main attraction for the congregation at large\nand made the long hours in synagogue enjoyable and edifying. Both\nfamiliar tunes and new melodies were heard with pleasure. The\nformer is indicated by the fact that we often find passages from older\npieces inserted into the manuscripts of later creations—no doubt be-\ncause they had been familiar and cherished songs. The latter is proved\nby the many references to guest cantors from foreign countries and\ntheir appearances found in the Geniza papers. The notation of He-\nbrew synagogue poetry in Lombardic neumes by the Norman prose-\nlyte Obadiah is a case in point.18\n\nThe renegade Samuel the Maghrebi, who embraced Islam in 1163,\nfound it necessary to explain to his Muslim readers this musical aspect\nof the synagogue service which was so utterly strange to them (but\nhad a fairly exact counterpart in the liturgy of the Eastern churches):\n\nGoitein, S.

When the Persians rebuked them for acting against\nthe prohibition of public prayer the Jews retorted: we do not pray,\nwe only make music.1®\n\nThis pseudohistorical explanation of the origin of the piyyat was\nnot an invention of the learned renegade. It was a commonplace in\nthe arguments of the many generations of Jewish scholars in the cen-\nturies preceding him who wished to eliminate this popular element\nfrom the service and tried to discredit its very raison d’étre. They\nwere not successful. Their failure is proved not only by the enormous\namount of liturgical poems actually found, but also by direct refer-\nences to their recital in the Geniza letters.2\n\nNaturally, we hear also about the actions of the opponents. In an\nexceedingly eloquent, but somewhat ridiculous, letter overflowing\nwith Bible quotations, a certain group—no doubt in a provincial town\n—~—complains about their communal leaders who had abolished the\ntime-honored chanting of the various insertions on Sabbaths, holi-\ndays, and weekdays.

But the local potentates had remained adamant in\ntheir decision to do away with these accretions to the official liturgy.\nNow the group admonishes the addressce, a renowned physician and\nconfidant of the sultan, to be as courageous as Queen Esther (quoting\nthe Book of Esther 4:16) and to approach the ruler with a request to\nenable them to have a service according to the customs of their fore-\nfathers.2!\n\nIn the light of this letter we understand Moses Maimonides’ leni-\nency with regard to the insertion of poetical passages into the estab-\nlished text of the liturgy. Asked about them by a cantor, newly\nappointed to a place where these additions were chanted, the sage,\nin his usual wisdom, replied that they were indeed highly improper,\nbut their recitation was preferable to the communal strife that would\ninevitably erupt as soon as the newcomer would try to abolish them.\nThis decision, as well as the letter summarized, show how enamored\nthose worshipers must have been of those poetical pieces—or at least\nof their traditional tunes.

Otherwise, we\nwould not find the cantors competing with one another so eagerly to\nfind (or produce) ever new texts, as shown in chapter vi, section 10,\nbelow. Even at the end of the classical Geniza period there must have\nbeen in any large community a considerable number of persons who\nwere able to understand and to appreciate those difficult poems, and\nthe synagogue, we remember, was not only a house of worship, but\nalso of study; or rather, as often said, study was worship. In addition,\nit seems to me that the piyyiits fulfilled in those days a role compar-\nable with crossword puzzles in our own society. Since almost every\nline contained a hidden allusion to a Bible verse or a passage of\ntalmudic literature, every new poem must have prompted a vigorous\ncontest to determine the poet’s sources and intents. Thus, while the\ntraditional, or newly imported, meledies were a devotional pastime\nfor the many, the effort required for the full understanding of the\ntexts was a mental exercise for the more sophisticated.\n\nThe leadership in prayer of a congregation was not confined to\none or two persons officiating permanently. Instead, both the recita-\ntion of the different sections of the liturgy and the readings from\nthe Scriptures were assigned to members or guests present.

In a query, possibly sent from an expand-\ning community, Moses Maimonides was asked whether such heredi-\ntary honors were lawful since “the Torah is no heirloom” (Sayings\nof the Fathers 2:12), that is, everyone should be honored according\nto the knowledge and merits he himself acquired. Maimonides’ answer\nis characteristic. If the persons designated to replace the hereditary\nreaders were more learned or Godfearing, their claims should be\nheeded. Otherwise, the principle of heredity had precedence, since\nit was conducive to the preservation of peace.2\n\nAs an exceptional honor, a distinguished guest was entrusted with\nassigning the sections of the Scripture lections to the persons to be\ncalled up to recite them.2¢ Complaints about high-handed procedures\nin these matters on the part of the synagogue presidents were com-\nmon.

The titles and merits of one’s\nforefathers were mentioned in the prayer, up to seven or more genera-\ntions back, particularly when they had achieved the virtues of piety,\ngenerosity, or learning. The very large number of memorial lists pre-\nserved in the Geniza testifies to the wide diffusion of this socio-\nreligious custom.3?\n\nThe prayer over the dead was called either by the ancient Aramaic\nterm dukhran, derived from its traditional opening, “To the blessed\nmemory of those who rest in peace,” or by the more popular Arabic\nterm farhim (taken from the beginning of another—Hebrew—form\nof the prayer: “May God have mercy upon the soul of . . . 7). It was\nusually followed by a prayer over the person whose ancestors were\neulogized (and, we may assume, had made a contribution).

Maimonides objects to this custom in the strongest terms:\nthe synagogue was a house of worship of God, not of mourning for\nmen. Only in the most exceptional case of the death of a very great\ndivine was such a procedure permissible (meaning that the assembly\nwas in honor of the divine, not of the dead man). His answer implies\nalso that the custom was not in vogue in Fustat, nor have I found it\nattested in any Geniza document. In Fustat, they recited dirges in\nthe synagogue during the seven days of mourning. Maimonides toler-\nated this custom only on the strength of the legal fiction that at the\ntime of the erection of that building it had been stipulated that a\nsection of it might serve as a place of mourning, a legal fiction for\nwhich there was a precedent in the Talmud.

Nor were they in a2 mosque or, as I learn from Professor\nAziz Atiya, in a medieval Coptic church.33\n\nThe Jewish, like the Muslim and Christian, religious service had\nalso a political aspect, inasmuch as it contained a prayer for the ruler\nand for the Jewish ecumenical and territorial authorities. Whenever\nthere was a rivalry between leaders, the community had to take sides.\nPrayers for the ruler were said only on special occasions, it seems,\nespecially at the most solemn service of the Jewish liturgical year: the\none held on the evening preceding the Day of Atonement. This cus-\ntom still prevails today in some Oriental communities. Such a prayer,\nsaid for the Fatimid caliph al-Amir (d. 1181) is translated in Mediter-\nranean People 3+\n\nIn addition to the public prayer for the communal authorities it\nwas customary for readers and preachers to preface their performance\nwith a symbolic request of permission by the Gaon or Nagid in office\n(see p. 20, above). Even the reading of the Aramaic translation of the\nPentateuch and the Prophets was introduced in this way. The Geniza\nhas preserved a preamble referring to so late a Nagid as David, the\ngrandson of Maimonides (1237-1300). Since Aramaic was no longer\ngenerally understood, the preamble was written in Hebrew and in\nquite elegant Hebrew at that. The reader takes permission first from\nGod, second from the Torah, third from all the saints and scholars,\nand finally, as the chief of the latter, from the Nagid, whose titles are,\nof course, enumerated. At the end the wish is expressed that the\nNagid be restored to health. Most probably this addition was the\nreason the preamble was written down and not merely recited from\nmemory.33\n\nWhenever a difference of opinion about liturgy, leadership in\nprayer, or any other question led to communal strife, the dissenting\ngroup would refrain from “going down to,” that is, attending, the\nsynagogue, not so much for the sake of demonstrating, as out of re-\nligious scruples. For it was regarded as unlawful to say a prayer when\nled by an unworthy person. An Oxford manuscript contains a very\ndetailed query in this respect showing that the writer was as dis-\nquieted by the thought of attending synagogue as by that of staying\naway from it, since communal prayer was regarded to be so much\nmore meritorious than one said at home. An extensive and beautifully\nwritten letter of a Gaon of Jerusalem, addressed to Fustat, castigates\nnonattendance of public prayer as a grave transgression, whatever\nthe reasons.3¢ When a worshiper who was assigned a part of the read-\ning of the lection was suspected of improper conduct by other mem-\nbers of the congregation, he was prevented by them from ascending\n\nGoitein, S.

A detailed witness to such an occurrence is\npreserved with regard to a small town of the Egyptian delta.3?\n\nExactly the same situation prevailed in Islam. Once, when the\ngreat al-Hajjaj, later viceroy of Iraq, was sent by the caliph together\nwith another ambassador to a rebel prince, he refused to take part in\nthe public prayer. According to him it was an act of impiety to pray\nbehind one breaking up the unity of Islam. His colleague did partici-\npate, explaining that he preferred congregational to private prayer\nunder al] circumstances.®® When the people of Qayrawin, Tunisia,\nrefused any longer to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Fatimid\ncaliph and of the religious sect headed by him, they stayed away from\nthe service, but would come furtively to the mosque saying: “God,\nyou are our witness,” meaning that they were prepared to join public\nprayer, but were unable to do so for religious and political reasons.3?\n\nSince everything done by or for the “Holy Congregation” was hal-\nlowed with a religious connotation, the synagogue was also the proper\nplace for attending to communal affairs. The letters of the ecumenical\nor territorial authorities or of other communities, near and far, were\nread out, discussed, and acted upon; resolutions proposed by the\nelders or by an individual leader were acclaimed or rejected; bans\nwere pronounced and public chastisements, such as stripes, were ad-\nministered; collections were solicited, vows for donations made, and\nreports about public finances or other matters rendered during or\nimmediately after the service or between the prayers. In our day,\npublic appeals are normally inaugurated by mammoth dinners. In\nthose times, when dire calamities called for concerted efforts, an op-\nposite method was adopted. A public fast was announced, the shops\nwere closed, and everyone was bound to be present at the synagogue\nservice, where he would also vow his share.4®\n\nIn short, all matters of public concern, described above in section\nB, 1, were normally transacted in the synagogue, in conformity with\nage-old, even pre-Christian usage (synagogue, and its Hebrew equiva-\nlent, béth kenéseth, after all, do not mean anything but “house of\nassembly”), and the Muslim house of worship, the mosque, was its\ncounterpart.*! Special invitations to meet in the synagogue for delib-\ncrations on public affairs have been found in the Geniza.

In the early seventeenth century (1603) there were\nin Istanbul, Turkey, approximately five thousand taxpayers (male\nadults), affiliated with about forty different synagogues. Besides the\nKaraites, there were only two groups who conducted communal af-\nfairs, especially representation before government: the Romaniotes,\nthe ancient Ram, the original Jewish inhabitants of the Ottoman\nempire (who were called thus, because at that time, over 150 years\nafter the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks, they still spoke\nGreek, and not Turkish), and the Sepharadim, refugees from Spain\nor their descendants, who spoke a Spanish vernacular, but many of\nwhom had lived for many years, or even several generations, in other\ncountries. Unlike the Palestinians and Babylonians of the Geniza\nperiod, the Romaniotes and Sepharadim had no central synagogues,\nbut were dispersed in many houses of worship, two synagogues some-\ntimes named after the same place of origin.

I\nwas also much pleased with the quality of the reading done (of course,\nall by laymen). Had I left in the middle of the service for another\nplace of prayer (as I had intended to do), I could have had only praise\nfor those simple people. Suddenly, however, everything changed. One\nman at the end of the room remarked in a loud voice that the reader\nof the scroll had made a mistake. Immediately a man from the other\nend retorted in an even louder voice that this was not true. In a mat-\nter of seconds pandemonium reigned. Everyone shouted together,\nstools and chairs flew through the air, often splintering to pieces upon\nhitting the ground. Fortunately, the leader of one faction made a\nsign to his men to leave the room. Immediately, the other faction\nfollowed (outside the womenfolk, obviously prepared for such emer-\ngencies on a Purim night, had already summoned the police).

They were by no means\nawarded indiscriminately. It is noteworthy that, as far as we know,\nduring the classical Geniza period, the title hdvér, or member of the\nyeshiva, was bestowed only on persons renowned for some measure\nof learning.\n\nIn view of this state of affairs it is easy to understand why in those\ndays there was no rigid distinction between scholars and persons in\neconomic vocations, A learned merchant could easily become a fuli-\ntime judge or teacher, while religious functionaries would sometimes\ndo business or even engage in some manual occupation. Nevertheless,\nalthough the demarcation lines were fAuid, there existed a class of\nprofessionals serving as judges, notaries, teachers, cantors, or active\nin various other capacities. These “servants of the community,” as\nthey were called, received salaries and other emoluments from public\nand private funds, but their position was often precarious owing to\nthe institutional weaknesses or the vicissitudes of fortune of the\norganizations they served.\n\nSecular education was the preserve of the higher classes. It was of\ntwo entirely different types: the scientific-philosophical and the\nliterary-administrative. The first prepared for the medical profession,\nthe second for government service. Only the former consisted of a\nwell-organized and long-established course of studies (which origin-\nated in pre-Islamic times) and was acquired not only through private\ntuition and reading, but partly also in public institutions attached to\nthe hospitals. The training of the government official, the katib (lit.,\nscribe), comprised Arabic calligraphy, language and some literature,\nand probably also the study of some of the encyclopedias and hand-\nbooks of administration, written for the use of the scribes. It was an\nart or technique rather than a science, and, although it sometimes led\nto high social positions, it lacked the prestige that the study of philos-\nophy, medicine, and related subjects conveyed. The Arabic term\nhakim (learned) was the word commonly used for “physician,” but, at\nthe same time, it designated a man of philosophical erudition in gen-\neral.\n\nIt was characteristic of the period under discussion that religious\nand legal erudition was often combined with philosophic and scien-\ntific training. The most famous examples are the great Spanish philos-\nopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes, 1126-1198), who served as chief gadi, or\nMuslim judge, in Cérdoba, Spain, and his contemporary Moses\nMaimonides (1135-1204), born in the same city, but spending most of\nhis life in Egypt, whose compendium on Jewish religious law was a\n\nGoitein, S.

The Geniza proves that this com-\nbination of religious and secular scholarship was by no means excep-\ntional.\n\nOn the other hand, only rarely do we find in our documents a\nkatib, or government official, renowned also as a religious scholar.\nThe illustrious example of Samuel ha-Nagid of Granada (993-1056),\nwho was a vizier and general, a prolific poet and litterateur, and at\nthe same time a most competent author on Jewish religious law, has\nno counterpart in the East.\n\nIn general we have to keep in mind that the cultural climate varied\nvery much from one country to another. Of all the countries repre-\nsented in the Geniza papers, Egypt, their place of origin, was the least\nfavorable for the pursuit of scholarly studies. Had a Geniza been\nfound in Cérdoba or Qayrawan, the standards of education discern-\nible in it certainly would have been much different from what they\nappear in the Cairo Geniza. Immigrant scholars to Egypt by far sur-\npassed the indigenous crop in both quality and number. It is precisely\nfor this reason, however, that the general level of culture in the\nMediterranean basin is perhaps more evident from the Cairo Geniza\nthan it would have been from a hoard of manuscripts found in a\nmore creative, but less cosmopolitan, center than the capital of Egypt.\n\nOwing to its religious character, education in medieval times was\nmore closely connected than other domains of social life with the\nspecific tenets, ritual, and literature of each community. In this chap-\nter, an attempt has been made to eliminate, as far as possible, the\nspecifically Jewish aspects of education. It lies in the very nature of\nthe subject that such an attempt can be only partly successful.

You men-\ntioned in your letter that your boys studied the Sacred Law and\nArabic and Hebrew calligraphy. We thanked God for this.” 2 In a\nbusiness letter, a merchant abroad asks his correspondent in Old\nCairo to see to it that his boy does not interrupt his studies; if the\nneed arises, his friend was to advance the school fees.? There are sev-\neral instances of fathers on travel giving instructions to their wives or\nother relatives with regard to the proper education of their children,\nor complaining bitterly about a wife “letting the boy miss the school\nand play in the streets.” The writer sends his brother 15 dirhems for\nthe teacher and a fine piece of clothing for the boy so that he should\nfeel well in school from which he should not absent himself for a\nmoment.*\n\nSchool fees were a regular item in family budgets, even modest\nones. A contract of partnership contains the proviso that wheat and\nwine—the basic victuals—were to be acquired by the investor with the\nmoney accruing from the common business, while rent and school\nfees were to be paid by him separately.5 A woman wishing to prove in\ncourt that her husband had no claims on her, because he did not be-\nhave as the father of a family, argued that he never paid the school\nfees for their boys (she had done so with her own earnings).

The reason\nfor this is to be sought in faulty educational theories. First, despite\nmany warm words about children in talmudic literature, childhood\nin general was regarded as a state of imperfection; to occupy oneself\nwith such lowly creatures as minors was almost degradation. Second\n—and this notion infested higher studies as well—it was believed that\nknowing a text by heart must precede its understanding; as child-\nhood was at all events only a preparatory stage, the pupil wasted\nmost of his time memorizing.

Nevertheless, the old and redundant system was\ncontinued in many Oriental countries, as we know, right down to the\ntwentieth century.\n\nThe main aim of the school was the preparation of its pupils for\ntaking an active part in the synagogue service. In this respect, it ful-\nfilled a function similar to that of the Song School of contemporary\nnorthern Europe, in which church chant was the most prominent\npart of the curriculum. To be sure, the requirements of the synagogue\nservice in those days were very high. The Five Books of Moses (the\nPentateuch) were read in their entirety from a sacred scroll, which\nwas written in the ancient fashion without vowels and signs for can-\ntillation.? A man called up to read a section had to know it more or\nless by heart. Similarly, each member wishing to participate had to\nbe fluent in the readings from the Prophets as well as in Aramaic\ntranslations, the Targiim, of the Prophets, the Pentateuch, and some\nother books of the Bible. A boy chanting the Targiim “on the Torah,”\nthat is, translating into Aramaic the Hebrew lection read by an adult\nverse by verse, was the pride of his parents. A long business letter\nsent from Cairo to a merchant on a trip to India contains also this\nremark: “Your boy Faraj now reads the Targiim accompanying the\nlections—as I guaranteed you he would.” 10\n\nThis passage from a twelfth-century letter reminds me of a com-\nplaint by an illiterate Yemenite woman, bitterly criticizing (in her\nArabic vernacular, of course) the modern education to which her\nchildren were exposed in Israel. “What do you teach in your schools,”\nshe said to me, “stories, children’s songs, and the like. With us in\nYemen, a boy of ten stands up in synagogue and reads the Targim.”\nClearly, her idea of education was that only very difficult subjects\nwere worthy of being taught in a school. (We perhaps err a little in\nthe opposite direction.)\n\nSome clarification of this problem of the reading of the Targiim\nseems to be appropriate since it is apt to throw light on the whole\nprocess of schoolteaching in the Middle Ages. In ancient times, when\nAramaic was the spoken vernacular, it was a wonderful event for a\nboy “to stand up in synagogue” and to provide an explanatory trans-\nlation of the biblical text just read by an adult member of the con-\ngregation.

The\ncustom must have been a most efficient means of initiating a young-\nster into the society of the grownup. When, however, Aramaic became\nextinct, the procedure became meaningless, and the text had to be\nmemorized by rote (in addition, of course, to Hebrew, which also had\nto be acquired in school), undoubtedly a heavy burden which only\nbrighter boys were able to bear. In the Eastern churches, where\nSyriac and Coptic, the liturgical languages, also became obsolete\nduring the High Middle Ages, comparable educational difficulties\nmust have existed. Similarly, classical Arabic, the language of the\nKoran, the holy book of Islam, was not the language spoken by a\nMuslim boy whose vernacular was Middle Arabic. Classical Arabic\nand its intricate grammar had to be learned in school “just like math-\nematics,” as Ibn Khaldin, the Tunisian philosopher of history, re-\nmarks pointedly (writing in 1377). The position of Latin in western\nEurope was similar, although the Catholic service does not require\nparticipation of the laity to the same degrce as do the Muslim and\nthe Jewish, where, as remarked before, study also was worship.\n\nThe poetical insertions into the official text of the synagogue\nliturgy, whose correct chanting must have been difficult even for\nadults (see chap. v, sec. D, 2, above), were studied in school.1? The\nregular prayers, however, although very much extended and involved,\nare nowhere mentioned as a school subject. The boys obviously were\nexpected to grasp texts by listening and responding while regularly\nattending synagogue with their fathers. In Oriental rites, it should\nbe noted, virtually the whole liturgy is chanted aloud (and not read\nmostly in silence, as was customary in Europe).\n\nChristian elementary education in the East was very much like the\nJewish. A catholicus, or head of the Nestorian church, reported that\nthe boys learned the Pentateuch, the Prophets, the Psalms, and the\nliturgy in school, but, when they reached the New Testament, they\nleft school. Understandably, the catholicus changed the order of the\ntexts to be learned to better suit the specific needs of Christian edu-\ncation. But it was the texts used in the church service which were the\nexclusive object of study.!? As is well known, the Muslim elementary\nschool, the kuttab, is similarly devoted to the memorizing of the\nKoran. It is worthy of note that the Geniza papers use the word\nkuttab also with reference to Jewish schools.\n\nThere was one bright side to this rather unsatisfactory picture of\nmedieval elementary education.

Certain parts of the liturgy were reserved to\nbe sung by a boy.15 Sometimes a boy would be honored with the chant-\ning of the whole Scripture portion of a holiday, such as the reading\nof the Book of Esther—no small feat. For such an honor, a large dona-\ntion had to be made to the congregation. The Geniza has preserved a\nlovely story from a little town in Lower Egypt, where a mother, with\nthe help of her daughter, bought this honor for her boy for the price\nof 40 dirhems, whereas the father obviously had second thoughts\nabout such use of so much money.18\n\nThe syllabus of the elementary school was not confined to religious\nsubjects everywhere.

Non-Jewish children\nmay also study in the synagogue for the sake of good relationship with\nthe neighbors, although this is not desirable.” Since gentile children\ncould hardly have been expected to memorize Hebrew religious texts,\nsecular subjects must have taken up considerable time in the schools,\nin respect to which the legal opinion quoted was given. Incidentally,\nthe caliph al-Mutawakkil prohibited in 850 the admission of non-\nMuslim children to Muslim schools or their teaching by Muslim pri-\nvate tutors. Similar prohibitions appear in Arabic literature both\nbefore and after that time, so that in actual life confessional segrega-\ntion certainly was not strictly adhered to.18\n\nReferences to the study of Arabic calligraphy by children are fre-\nquent, but those on the teaching of arithmetic are scarce. In one, a\nfragment in the hand of Halfén b. Manasse ha-Levi (1100-1139), a\nwidow makes an agreement with an “elder,” perhaps an old merchant\nand not a professional teacher, to instruct her boy in Arabic calligra-\nphy and arithmetic. In calligraphy, the aim to be reached was that\nthe boy be able to take down a dictation without mistakes in spelling,\nin arithmetic that he master more complicated accounts with the aid\nof the abacus (the primitive calculating instrument still used by our\nchildren) and the “tens,” referring presumably to more complicated\naccounts.

The teacher would draw huge and elaborate calligraphic out-\nlines of the letters and the children would fill them in with red,\nbrown, green, and other colors; or the children would draw in var-\nious colors the outlines of letters written artistically by the teacher.\nThe same method was followed with the writing of the combination\nof letters or of verses or passages from the Scriptures and moral say-\nings. The covers of the exercise books would have decorative draw-\nings, such as eight intertwined snakes having heads of fishes or birds.\nOrnaments in different colors, for example, the six-cornered star of\nDavid (which at that time was not a specifically Jewish emblem) or a\ncandelabrum with seven arms (which was) would embellish the in-\nside.

Every schoolboy had to do\nexercises which consisted of writing the letters of the alphabet for\nwhich purpose he used a wooden board. These exercises were not an\nend in themselves, but solely a means to learn reading. Once the\npupils had mastered the reading, the art of writing was not further\npursued in the regular elementary school. Therefore, we find in the\nGeniza hundreds of signatures on documents not in the cursive script\nused in day-to-day writing, but in the monumental ductus common\nin books, and mostly in very shaky and awkward shapes. These were\nthe signatures of artisans and shopkeepers of low standing, who had\nnot gone beyond the elementary stage of schooling.2? It is also not\nsurprising that a query was submitted to Maimonides about persons\nsigning documents that they were unable to read. Documents were\nnormally written in the cursive script which these persons had not\nlearned. Only at a higher stage of schooling was the art of writing\ntaught systematically.23\n\nFour types of students were trained in calligraphy: future govern-\nment officials, physicians, religious scholars, and merchants. Thus,\nthe art of writing—not of reading, which was far more widespread—\nwas the distinctive mark of a person belonging to the professional or\nhigher classes.\n\nOnce I asked a Yemenite informant, a craftsman, but very learned\nin traditional Jewish studies, to write down for me a word of his\nArabic vernacular which I was unable to grasp phonetically. To my\namazement I discovered that this man who had put me to shame more\nthan once with his knowledge of Jewish ritual law and cabala, did\nnot know how to write, but drew the letters slowly and insecurely\nlike a child. When he became aware of the expression of astonish-\nment in my face he said contemptuously: “I am not a business clerk.”\n\nNot every Jewish merchant of the Geniza period, even one engaged\nin overseas trade, was versed in Arabic calligraphy. The writer of a\nletter in good Arabic style and orderly Hebrew characters asks his\ncorrespondent not to use Arabic script (as in previous letters) since\nhe did not know it and had to trouble friends to read to him the\nletters received and then would sometimes forget what he had\nheard.2* An important Muslim trader and shipowner did not know\nhow to read or to write at all.?> We should not jump to the conclu-\nsion, though, that in letters written by a person different from\nthe sender the latter was illiterate.

The\nnumerous fragments of copies of correspondence indicate that the\nboys were trained in copying model letters. The artistic products of\nArabic litterateurs, although not entirely absent from the Geniza,\ncannot ordinarily have served as models, since we do not find their\nexample followed in the countless letters actually preserved. Rather,\nthe teachers must have adopted a method still practiced at the be-\nginning of this century in Baghdad (and which, with certain im-\nprovements, is even used here today in schools of commerce): a\nteacher would ask merchants of good standing or private persons to\nfurnish him with discarded letters which then were used by his pupils\nas material for their exercises in reading and writing. And who\nknows: perhaps a large percentage of the business and private letters\nwe hold in our hands today found their way into the Geniza of the\nPalestinian synagogue because they had been used as models by\nschoolboys who had studied them in a room quite nearby.2¢\n\nThe legal deeds on the backs of which we find all manner of writ-\nings in childish hands, such as verses of poetry or proverbial sayings,\nmost probably served a similar purpose. Most Geniza letters are writ-\nten in a good and firm style and include many traditional phrases,\nalso pointing to the fact that the art of letter writing was acquired\nthrough systematic study.\n\nEach country had its own brand of calligraphy and epistolary\nstyle. Letters from Spain are written almost entirely in classical and\nvery ornate Arabic,2? but in extremely cursive Hebrew characters\nthat make difficult reading. In Tunisia, Egypt, and Syria a straight-\nforward standard Arabic was used for the most part, and the writing\nwas far more similar to the type used in books, although marked\ndifferences in detail are to be noted among these three regions. In\nYemen again, the Arabic was more flowery, although not classical,\nwhile the Hebrew script it was written in was, as a rule, almost orna-\nmental. Similar differences can be observed among the various periods\ndocumented in the Geniza papers.\n\nThe letters written in Arabic script generally show a fairly good\nstyle, while the Hebrew preambles and the many epistles composed\nin Hebrew usually betray full mastery of the literary language. In\norder to attain such standards, the writers had to study the grammar\n\nGoitein, S. D.

He wishes now to be sent to school [kuttib]. In case you are\nnot back in time, please send some appropriate clothing for his body\nand cover for his head.” (A turban was an indispensable part of a\nwell-dressed person’s apparel. Only the lowest of the low would have\ncontented himself with a skullcap.) 3%\n\nAs everywhere in the world, boys were sometimes naughty. A\nteacher writes to a father that his little one had shown great eagerness\nin study from the day he had entered school, but that another boy\n(the scoundrel’s name is registered, of course) broke the son’s wooden\nwriting board with the connivance of the whole class (who obviously\ndisliked the newcomer’s zeal).3¢ Other disciplinary problems are re-\nferred to below. In a letter written in Arabic characters (so that the\nboy carrying the message would not be able to read it), a teacher in-\nforms a parent that his son Misa (Moses), after having missed school\nfor a number of days, entered class while he, the teacher, was occupied\nwith another boy. Having been assigned silent reading Musa finished\nquickly, and, when asked to repeat, swore he would never read a text\nmore than once—and had run off. But, the teacher’s complaint ends,\nonly by repeating the biblical text four or five times could one know\nit by heart (which, we remember, was the aim of instruction).” The\npurport of this and other letters not summarized here was of course\nthat the home should take care of the punishment that the school\nwas unwilling or unable to inflict. On the other hand, a father send-\ning his two boys to school asks the teacher not to spank the elder one\nfor being late; he had studied Arabic at home and it had taken more\ntime than anticipated; the father asks the teacher not to spank the\nlittle one because he was not expected to go to school alone and had\nto wait for his elder brother.38\n\nWith the exception of the religious holidays vacations seem not to\nhave been customary. But it is evident from a number of passages that\nparents took their children with them when they traveled to attend\nfamily events or simply to visit relatives.

In reply to a letter of\nthe judge of Minyat Zifti, who had asked him to take the place of a\nforeigner intending to return to his country, a teacher from the little\ntown of Damira writes that he would come only upon receipt of a\nwritten invitation of the community confirming that the incumbent\nwas definitely leaving and that they unanimously wished him “to take\ncare of their children.” 8\n\nThis competition also had salutary effects, as it was apt to improve\nthe quality of teaching. Most likely, in larger cities, a certain scho-\nlastic gradation existed among the various schools. When we find in\na list of communal expenses that an orphan was transferred after a\nfew months from one kuttab to another, it is perhaps correct to as-\nsume that his progress in the first prompted the move—at least, that\nwas the procedure in the larger towns of Yemen, where conditions\nsimilar to those of the Geniza period prevailed until the mass exodus\nof the Jews in 1949-1950.% Even a wretched little community, like\nQalyab (see n. 4), appreciated the quality of its teacher. When the\nauthorities in the capital intended to replace him by another religious\nfunctionary, the ten representatives of the small community signing\nthe document categorically refused to accept any teacher other than\nthe old one, “because of the debt of gratitude which our children\nowe him for their education.”10\n\nThe average tuition fee, as several official documents tell us, was\nhalf a dirhem per pupil per week, when the community bore the\ncost. Three brothers attending one school were granted a reduction.!!\nWhen provincial towns, like al-Mahalla in Lower Egypt, promised\nto pay its teacher 20 dirhems a week, it was probably done under the\nsupposition that around forty boys would attend his school.’2 In the\nhouse of a well-to-do merchant, when the private teacher threatened\nto quit, his salary was raised from 10 to 15 dirhems per week, or 1-14\ndinars per month. (In those years, as often, the ratio of gold and\nsilver coins was one to forty.) Thus, he received for private tuition as\nmuch as he would have for the teaching of thirty children in a\nkuttib.!® In addition to the fees, “extras” were vowed by the commu-\nnities, and presents were given to the teachers on holidays, for ex-\nample, on Hanukkah, the Feast of the Lights, which coincides\n\nGoitein, S.

Thus, a scholar, a Palestinian refugee who\nserved as teacher in a little town in Egypt, refused to take on addi-\ntional duties in order to avoid conflicts with the local community\nleader, who was also a Palestinian. In explaining his situation, he\nsays: “I confine myself to the teaching of the boys in order to remain\nindependent of anyone.” 2! A court scribe and teacher from a promi-\nnent family in Alexandria which had provided the local community\nwith physicians and judges for about two hundred years writes to a\nfriend: “It is only by the teaching of boys that we have bread to\neat.” 22 With regard to several teachers we possess legal documents or\nother records showing that they had been able to give considerable\nloans, or that they left sizable sums to relatives, or that they had\npossessed a slave girl or part of a house.?* The Geniza has even pre-\nserved the story of a physician in a small place who undertook the\nteaching of schoolchildren in addition to his medical work, as hap-\npened when a local teacher, a Palestinian, had to betake himself to\nCairo to pay his poll tax, for aliens had to pay theirs to a central office\nand not in the town where they were resident. The physician became\nso enthusiastic, not about his pedagogical success, but about the addi-\ntional income accruing to him from teaching, that he did not let the\nchildren go back to their former teacher when the Palestinian re-\nturned from the capital. The document containing the rather ridicu-\nlous story is a complaint about the doctor’s encroachment.?4\n\nAs only persons with a good handwriting could become teachers,\nnormally, it is natural that some of them served also as scribes, either\nto private persons, or to courts, or as copyists of books.2s Some teach-\ners, as the Geniza shows, were accomplished calligraphers.2® The\nprofession of copyist was connected with that of bookseller, and we\nfind a number of teachers working in that field.2” Another profession\neasily combined with teaching was that of the cantor, or singer who\nled the community in prayer.28 It is perhaps worthwhile noting that\nin medieval times the English term “cantor” denoted the elementary\nteacher in the Song School, which was connected with the church.2?\n\nAlthough schoolteachers were not necessarly scholarly persons,\nthere appear quite a number of them in the Geniza who were called\ntalmid, that is, scholar, and even havér, which corresponds to a doc-\ntor of law.

In general, the teacher in the Geniza period seems to have\nenjoyed higher esteem than in late Roman times, when he was ridi-\nculed by the popular pantomime as a stupid ignoramus. This notion\nwas carried over into early Islam, where the imbecile schoolmaster\nremained the standing object of ridicule and scorn. So much so, in-\ndeed, that some learned Muslim lawyers ruled that a schoolmaster’s\ntestimony in court should be regarded as being worth only half that\nof a man (namely, like that of a woman, who, according to Muslim\n—and other medieval—notions was officially regarded as a creature of\nlimited intelligence). The great viceroy of Iraq, al-Hajjij (d. June,\n714), was discredited and satirized for having served in his youth as\na teacher. The tenth-century Muslim geographer Ibn Hawgqal de-\nscribes the people of Palermo, Sicily, as feebleminded because they\nheld their schoolmasters in high regard.3® Contempt for the teachers\nof children remained alive in Egypt until the very end of the Middle\nAges, to judge from the stories of The Arabian Nights especially de-\nvoted to this subject.3!\n\nThe Geniza documents demonstrate that the situation within the\nJewish community differed considerably. Fathers addressing teachers\ndo so respectfully, and not as employers talking to their employees;\nthe communal officials, from the Nagid downward, do the same; and\nthe leiters emanating from the teachers themselves, as a rule, betray\nnot only a good knowledge of Arabic and Hebrew, but also a certain\ndegree of general culture. In 1237, when the government asked a dele-\ngation of ten representatives of the Jewish community in Egypt to\ntestify to the proper election of David, the grandson of Maimonides,\nas Nagid, a schoolteacher, known to us from other sources, was\namong them.3?\n\nThe safest indication of the comparatively high social position of\nthe teacher in the Geniza society is the fact that in many instances\npersons signing a document add after the names of their fathers the\nword ha-melamméd (the teacher, Heb.).33 No one would have done\nso had this occupation not been regarded as a title of honor. Nor\nwould anyone have addressed Ephraim, “the distinguished member\nof the academy” and leader of the Jews of Fustat during the first half\nof the eleventh century, as “son of the melammeéd Shemarya,” had\nthis not been a status symbol to a certain degree.3* It is not impossible\nthat precisely because the general standard of culture was not very\nhigh among the Egyptian Jews during the Geniza period, the school-\nteacher, by his very profession a man of some erudition, occupied a\nhigher social position there than in other, more scholarly, Jewish\ncommunities.\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "vi, 5 Vocational Training 191\n\n5. VOCATIONAL TRAINING\n\nIt was generally accepted that elementary education was to be\ncomplemented by some training in a trade or profession.! As a son\nusually followed his father’s vocation, the training could often be\ngiven by the father himself. Otherwise, a parent had to bear the ex-\npenses of this additional stage of his son's education. Vocational\nschools, as far as we know, did not exist in those days. Instead, there\nwere renowned craftsmen who undertook the training of the boys\nand were paid for it. As in other agreements concerning work, such\narrangements with master artisans were made orally; at least a written\none has not been found so far in the Geniza, although there are refer-\nences to them. In a marriage contract with a divorcee, written 1110\nin Minyat Zifta, the bridegroom promises to feed and clothe the son\nof his future wife and to let him learn a craft. (He also undertook\nnot to inflict on him corporal punishment or even to hurt him with\nwords.) 2 A settlement between a husband and his wife, made in Old\nCairo in 1244, obligates the father to provide his two sons with cloth-\ning, while the mother has to pay for the board of the smaller boy for\nten years and for the board and poll tax of the elder for two years, as\nwell as for his training in the art of silversmithing.3\n\nMerchants, especially overseas traders, are forced by the very na-\nture of their business to use written records. Consequently, we also\nlearn more about initiation into commerce than with regard to\nmanual work. There were different ways to train a novice in business.\nThe most common practice was perhaps to send him to a renowned\nfirm as “servant,” that is, employee. Twice we hear of sons of first-\nranking families in Tunisia apprenticing in prominent business\nhouses of OId Cairo.f In two other instances such relationships were\nsuggested or established between the members of the same family\nresiding in the Maghreb and Egypt, respectively. In the midst of a\nlong business letter from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, addressed, in spring,\n1064, to the writer’s sister’s son, the following passage occurs: “I have\na boy who is beginning to mature. If you think it is all right, consult\nthe old man [the addressee’s father and the writer's brother-in-law]\nwhether I might send him to you next year so that he may stand be-\nfore you [i.e, be your “servant” and apprentice].

The\nrelationship itself was called “education.” 7\n\nThe relationship could develop into a strong allegiance, lasting\na lifetime. In a letter from Sicily, sent in, or around, 1064, the writer\nreports that he was afraid of traveling with his merchandise to Egypt,\nas the enemy (the Normans) had captured and burned many ships\nenroute to the Levant; another merchant, however, who owed him\nthanks for his “education,” undertook to transport the goods of his\nformer master to Egypt, while he sent his own consignments, which\nhe had already loaded on a ship going to Tunisia, with a third party.8\n\nFrequently a father would train his son in independence by hav-\ning business friends send modest quantities of goods to the young\nman who would deal in them “for the sake of learning.” ® Finally, as\noverseas business was done mostly by way of partnerships, fathers in\ndifferent countries would agree to let their boys do business of mod-\nerate size jointly, until they would become experienced merchants.1®\n\n6. ADULT EDUCATION\n\nAdult education is a modern term and carries with it the connota-\ntion of something exceptional: normally, we adults are satisfied with\nsending our children to school, while we regard ourselves free from\nthe obligation of pursuing formal studies, except for professional\npurposes. The attitude of the society described in this book was ap-\nproximately the opposite of our own. The elementary school was\nconsidered merely as a preparatory stage, and certainly was so in prac-\ntice. Study, that is, the regular, habitual reading and expounding of\nthe Bible and other sacred texts, was a duty incumbent on everyone\nand therefore could never be regarded as completed. The house of\nworship was also a house of learning, and the weekly and seasonal\ndays of rest and prayer were devoted in the main to study. Particular\ncare was taken to keep the synagogue illuminated during the night\nso that everyone who cared could study as long as he liked.

Once, there was com-\nmunal strife in the provincial town of al-Mahalla, and the dayyan\nJoseph, the spiritual leader of the community, had to leave the place.\nSeveral documents deal with this event. In one, a complaint is made\nthat the study of the sacred books, as it had been pursued in that\ntown in regular courses, as well as on Saturdays and holidays, was\ninterrupted. In another it is said that, because of the absence of the\nspiritual leader, most people were sitting in the streets or in the\nshade of the sycamores on Saturdays and holidays instead of listening\nto the words of the sacred law in the synagogues.? Conversely, a\nscholar newly arrived in the same town (about a hundred years later)\npraised the people’s regular attendance of the synagogue service,\n“their love of the Torah and its teachers.” 3 A letter from Alexandria,\nwhich expresses deep gratitude of the community for the appoint-\nment of an inspired teacher and “judge,” mentions that, prior to his\narrival, some people had intended to move to Old Cairo because of\nthe lack of spiritual guidance.# A young merchant in Old Cairo, de-\nscribing his prolonged illness to his father, who was away on a busi-\nness trip to India, adds that he still studies every evening with a\nscholar.?\n\nThis passage in a letter from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, in which the\nelder brother of Aba Zikri Judah Ibn Sighmar congratulates him on\nthe occasion of the birth of his firstborn, is particularly telling. After\nmany good wishes and numerous details about commercial and com-\nmunal affairs, he continues: “You wrote that you had gone over the\nBible a second time and knew it, and, furthermore, that you studied\nthe Mishnah and the Talmud. You made me extremely happy with\nthis. It really is the crowning of your success and happiness . . . but\nthe study of Arabic calligraphy should not be neglected.” ¢ When a\nyoung physician announced his intention to marry soon a relative\nof his correspondent, the latter answered that marrying a girl of a\ngood family was certainly reasonable, but the study of the sacred law\nwas even more meritorious. The young doctor was bidden to partici-\npate, together with his brother, who also was a physician, in the\ncourses given by the local “judge.” 7\n\nThe frequency of the weekday courses is not indicated in our\nsources. One document on the subject (around 1240) mentions that,\nin the absence of his father, who had to hide for political reasons,\nthe son of a judge in Old Cairo gave public classes, in addition to\nSaturday, on Sunday and Wednesday nights.

As to two elder boys, with whose previous edu-\ncation the writer was clearly unsatisfied, he asks his wife to have them\nattend the synagogue service every morning and evening, “so that\nstudy may become habitual with them [lit,, so that the Torah should\nbe fixed in their hearts),” suggesting that at the time and place con-\ncerned, it was customary—as known from many other communities in\nlater times—to conclude or precede the daily service by a short course\nof study, or at least, the reading by the community of several passages\nfrom a sacred, legal, or edificatory text.?\n\nAn avidly sought-after opportunity for adult study was to attend\nlectures, sermons, or disputations by visiting scholars (see sec. 9, be-\nlow). .\n\nIn view of the technicalities involved, no details can be given here\nof the exact content of adult courses or lectures.

Many changes, often recognizable in their\neffect rather than in their process, occurred during the centuries.\nUnder these circumstances any attempt to present a coherent and\nconcise, albeit elementary, outline of higher Jewish education in the\nGeniza period, as done in this and the following sections, necessarily\nexposes itself to criticism. I prefer such a risk to leaving this most\nimportant aspect of Jewish communal life without treatment.!\n\nThe term “academy,” generally used for the Jewish houses of learn-\ning in Iraq and Palestine, is inadequate. The yeshiva was originally\nnot an educational institution, at least not for young students? It\nmay well be that yeshiva is but a Hebrew version of Greek Sanhedrin\n(synhedrion), frequently mentioned in the New Testament, where it\nis translated as “council.” Literally, it denotes a place where people\nsit together, namely, scholars who expound the Bible and the sacred\nlaw (actually or allegedly contained in it), issue authoritative rulings\nconcerning the interpretation and application of the law, and decide\nlegal and religious questions submitted to them. The yeshiva thus\nunited the functions of an academy, a parliament, and a supreme\ncourt. To be sure, the members of the yeshiva never regarded them-\nselves as lawmakers, for “the Law is God’s” (Deuteronomy 1:17), but\nby deciding questions of public import by majority vote, they actually\nserved as a legislative body. In the Geniza period, the yeshiva still pre-\nserved much of its original character and, in official documents, was\ncalled “The Great Sanhedrin.” As stated, in most periods three\nyeshivas existed side by side, one in Palestine and two in Iraq. The\nyeshiva of Palestine was also called haviira, The Corporation, or\nhaviirat ha-sedeq, The Righteous Corporation (a term reminiscent\nof the Dead Sea Scrolls), scholars qualified to interpret and to admin-\nister the sacred law and themselves living according to its strictest\nstandards.3\n\nThe yeshiva originated in Hellenistic times, so that at the begin-\nning of the Geniza period, it had behind it a history of more than a\nthousand years. The learned opinions on civil and ritual law, as well\nas the expositions of the Bible developed in these houses of learning,\nwere collected around the conclusion of the second century of the\nChristian era and promulgated in an official corpus, called the\n\nGoitein, S.

The subjects contained in the Mishnah and other works\nfrom the Mishnaic period were elaborated and discussed in the schools\nof Palestine and Babylonia (today Iraq) for another two to three\ncenturies. Finally, the material accumulated was assembled in two\ncomprehensive collections, the Palestinian Talmud and the Baby-\nlonian Talmud.* The Talmud, a term sometimes used to include the\nMishnah as well, became the authoritative source of Jewish religion\nand law and formed the main object of study in the Jewish schools. A\nsimilar development took place independently in Islam, There too,\nat a certain juncture, the then existing literature on sacred law was\ncanonized, “the door of free reasoning became closed,” and all a\nscholar was allowed to do was to interpret the old sources, so as to\nadapt them to the needs of later developments.\n\nThe overwhelming authority of the Talmud may be partly ex-\nplained by the decline of the yeshivas at the time of its conclusion\n(approximately 400 in Palestine and 500 in Iraq). Palestine, then\nunder Byzantine rule, was afflicted with terrible oppression and perse-\ncution. Iraq, which during the same period formed part of the Persian\nempire, also suffered from great instability. The subsequent Muslim\nconquest, although granting relief in certain respects, was a devastat-\ning shock at first for the sedentary population, a shock that took cen-\nturies to heal. Thus there was a prolonged eclipse of the schools.\nWhen they recovered at the beginning of the eighth century, there\nexisted no literary work able to compete with the massive volume of\nthe Talmud, which represented the accumulated wisdom of the\nyeshivas during their most fertile periods. Moreover, the pervading\nspirit of Near Eastern and European civilization at that time was in\nfavor of authoritative compendiums that were regarded as containing\nin final form the entire content of a certain field of knowledge. This\ntendency prevailed in secular sciences, such as medicine, not less than\nin religious studies.\n\nThere are fairly detailed descriptions of the yeshivas of Iraq, dating\nfrom the tenth and the twelfth centuries, and responsa emanating\nfrom them have been preserved by the thousands. The membership\nof the yeshiva was limited to seventy, as was the Sanhedrin a thousand\nyears before; there was, however, no limitation to the number of\nscholars attached to it. The students were called “sons of a master,”\nor “sons of the house of their master,” for, unlike the scholars, they\nneeded the guidance and supervision of a teacher. The majority of\nthe members and scholars did not live on the campus, but served as\ncommunity officials, or were even engaged in a trade or profession.\nTwice a year, however, at the end of the summer and the end of the\n\nGoitein, S.

The Gaon, or head of the academy, would announce\nwhich section of the Talmud should be studied by the participants\nduring the intervening months, while at the kalla, as the month of\nstudy was called, the sections were expounded under his personal\nleadership. While teaching, the Gaon was assisted by “interpreters”\n(meturgeman or turgeman, an ancient Near Eastern word, which has\nfound its way into English in the form of dragoman). Originally,\nturgemans were mere broadcasters who carried the words of the mas-\nter to a large audience; in the Geniza period they relayed to the Gaon\nthe questions raised by the audience, insofar as they themselves were\nunable to supply the answers and conveyed the explanations to the\nquestioners. A German Jewish traveler recounts with amazement that\nthe Gaon Samuel b. Eli (in office 1164-1193) expounded at one time\nseveral sections of the Talmud to an audience of two thousand par-\nticipants, each section being transmitted by a different turgeman.\nMuslim higher studies had similar arrangements, and A. S. Tritton,\nin his book on Muslim education in the Middle Ages, expresses the\nbelief that the Jewish institution served as a model to the Muslim.?\n\nAt the spring kalla, the many questions addressed to the yeshiva\nfrom all over the world were discussed by the assembled scholars.\nThus the answers could be sent with the mail or the merchants who\nset out from Baghdad immediately after Passover (Easter). As repeat-\nedly emphasized, in Jewish juridical practice, these responsa fulfilled\nthe same task as do decisions of superior courts in present-day legal\nlife.8\n\nIn accordance with the triple role of the yeshiva as high court,\neducational establishment, and legislative body, it was led by a com-\nmittee of three, consisting of the Gaon, the av, or “father,” that is,\npresident of the court, who served as the deputy head of the yeshiva,\nand the scribe. The last was in charge of the responsible task of\nformulating the answers to the queries addressed to the yeshiva, and\nsome Gaons groomed their sons by appointing them to this office. As\na rule, in addition to the Gaon, only the president of the court ap-\npears regularly in the letters in which greetings are extended from\nthe staff of the yeshiva. He was the second in command (as he was in\nthe centuries preceding the Christian era) and normally replaced the\nGaon after his death.\n\nBesides the Gaon and the two assistant dignitaries, the yeshiva was\nled by scholars styled rosh ha-seder, or head of the row, each of whom\nwas in charge of one of the “rows” (originally seven), in which the\nmembers of the academy had their fixed seats in order of precedence.\n\nGoitein, S.

When, during the period described in this book, Jewish\nhouses of learning sprang up all over the Mediterranean basin, their\nheads often bore this title of rdsh ha-seder. Various other dignitaries\nof the Babylonian yeshivas appear in the letters of their heads, espe-\ncially the allif, or “distinguished member,” a title also borne by\nsome prominent alumni in Fustat, Qayrawan, and other cities of the\nWest.?\n\nOnly persons occupying a seat “in the rows” were supposed to take\nthe floor during learned disputations. Other scholars and the students\nparticipated as auditors. They studied in institutions attached to the\nyeshiva, called midrash. (This abbreviated term is more common in\nthe Geniza period than the older béth ha-midrash, lit., a place where\nthe Scriptures were expounded, but used in the general sense of a\nschool of higher studies.) It stands to reason that there exists some\nconnection between the word for the Muslim houses of learning,\nmadrasa, and this term. In the letters of the Gaons the heads of these\nmidrashim appear regularly after the heads of the rows. They are\nfollowed by the scholars reading courses for the broader public, and\nthe latter by the “group leaders.” We do not yet know what the latter\ndesignation means, but since it also appears in a house of learning\neven in the small town of Oria in southern Italy, these “groups” must\nhave been a common feature.8\n\nThe lowest grade of teachers in the yeshiva was the tannd'im (lit.,\n“repetitors,” those who make repeat), persons who knew the text of\nsections of the Mishnah or the Talmud with their correct cantilla-\ntions by heart and who trained students to memorize them by rote.\nCantillation, reciting a text in a singing manner with clear indication\nof short and long intervals, was of highest practical importance. For,\nunlike the biblical text, the Mishnah and Talmud texts at that time\ncarried neither punctuation marks nor vowel signs. Therefore, both\nthe pronunciation of the individual words and the correct division\nof a sentence into its various components depended entirely on the\noral tradition, the preservation of which was much helped by the\nsingsong accompanying the recitation. As a rule the repetitors were\nnot learned men; often, blind boys with a good memory were edu-\ncated to do the job. Even a great scholar, though, had occasion to seek\nthe help of these walking texts for ascertaining the correct reading of\na difficult passage.\n\nThe Yemenites, who have retained the ancient institution of the\n\nGoitein, S.

It was governed by a board of seven, headed,\nlike the Iraqian yeshivas, by the Gaon and the president of the court.\nThe other members were called Third, Fourth, Fifth, and so on, who,\nat the death or resignation of their superiors, moved up in strict order\nof precedence. Therefore, we find in the Geniza papers a person once\nstyled Sixth and later Fourth, or another being first Fourth and then\nThird; or a scholar, first appearing as Fourth, finally advancing to\nthe post of Gaon, or head of the school. Sometimes, a dignitary died\nbefore he had opportunity to be promoted; his title, let us say the\nSixth, would then be used by his descendants as a family name. Im-\nportant documents were signed by the Gaon, the president of the\ncourt, and the Third,!® while, at public appearances, the Third sat\nat the Gaon’s left, and the president at his right.1t\n\nWe see that the Palestinian yeshiva, like the Iragian, was adminis-\ntered by an executive committee of three, which tallies with the fact\nthat a Jewish court was normally composed of three persons.

The Gaon, Solomon b.\nJudah, was very old at that time, and, as we know from his own let-\nters, physically and spiritually weakened. The Gaon normally had\noverriding authority also in juridical matters. When he was younger,\nSolomon b. Judah himself exercised it freely. In a letter to his son\nAbraham (who temporarily sojourned in Egypt) he writes that he\nspent most of his time in Ramle sitting as judge, doing so “at the\nrequest of the community” and “at the demand of the parties.” The\noffice of the president of the court was a delegated authority, not an\nindependent position.

The rea-\nson for this fundamental difference lies in economic and social condi-\ntions. During the eighth through the tenth centuries, the period in\nwhich the Jewish ecumenical seats of learning prospered most, Iraq\nand Iran were among the richest countries of the world. They con-\ntained a very large Jewish population, which was able to maintain\nhundreds and even thousands of scholars as community officials or\nas part-time students. In Palestine, the scholars, as a rule, devoted all\ntheir time to study and prayer, living either on donations sent from\nall over the world to the yeshiva or to them personally, or on savings\nmade before their retirement. Thus, in Palestine, there was no need\nfor seasonal gatherings. The many “fellows of the academy,” who\nlived in Egypt, Syria, and other countries of the Mediterranean, had\nopportunity to meet during the holy pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which\ntook place during the autumn festivals and which culminated in the\ngreat assembly held on the Mount of Olives during the Feast of Taber-\nnacles.

Therefore, local schools of higher learning began to appear\nwherever a large Jewish community was formed. These schools mostly\ngathered around an outstanding teacher. The Geniza occasionally\ninforms us about the circumstances surrounding their foundation or\nabout schools whose existence had not been known at all, among\nthem the midrash of Old Cairo.\n\nBecause of the propinquity of the Palestinian academy, which for\nits maintenance relied heavily on the Jewish communities of Egypt,\nthere was no strong incentive to have a separate house of higher learn-\ning in Fustat. But in the last third of the tenth century, when an\neclipse in the fortunes of the Palestinian yeshiva coincided with the\nprominence in Egypt of a great scholar of Iragian training, Shemarya\nb. Elhanan (whose father had already been active there), a midrish,\nor college, was formed in Fustat by him. This development may have\nbeen connected with the advent of the Fatimids and the fact that at\nthat time Egypt had become the center of a great empire, as well as\nthe fountainhead of intensive, thoroughly organized religious propa-\nganda on behalf of the Isma’ilis, the ruling sect. We should keep in\nmind that, at the same time and place, a former Jew from Iraq, Ya'qib\n(Jacob) Ibn Killis, convert to Islam and Fatimid vizier, personaily\npresided over the establishment of the nucleus of what was later to\nbecome the famed Muslim University of al-Azhar. Shemarya’s son\nand successor, Elhanan, reports that before al-Hiakim’s persecutions,\nhis college had been in receipt of a government grant and he himself\nraised funds in Damascus and Acre, presumably, as surmised above,\n(p. 29), in the congregations adhering to the Babylonian rite. Elhanan\nwas an ambitious man, and, as a critical writer recounts, had his lec-\ntures broadcast by a scholar specifically appointed for the task, a\ncustom, we remember, prevailing in the yeshivas. Bans were pro-\nnounced against him by several authorities, presumably because of\nhis usurpation of such prerogatives of the higher institutions, and\nwhen he appeared at one of the yearly assemblies on the Mount of\nOlives, he was expelled. He recanted immediately and recognized the\nauthority of the Jerusalem yeshiva.!7 In any event, his school was not\na yeshiva, and he himself refers to it in his letters solely with the\nterms midrash or béth midrash, a college for students.18\n\n“Students,” to be sure, does not necessarily mean undergraduates.\n\nGoitein, S.

The letter critical of Elhanan b. Shemarya\ncited above emphasizes that it was not so much the impartment of\ntheoretical knowledge as the living tradition of the yeshiva which\nwas essential for the formation of a future scholar. By this he meant\nthe discussions and ways of reasoning by which its members arrived\nat their learned opinions and its judges at their legal decisions.?!\n\nMaterial considerations were also involved. In one of his early let-\nters Sherira Gaon (in office 967-1006), the father of Hay, decried the\ndangerous competition of the local colleges at a time when the\nBaghdad yeshivas were faced with financial disaster. “How can you\nbelieve,” he writes, “that you will remain intact and that your schools\nwill not suffer while the yeshiva goes to piecess We are your heads,\nas it is written: ‘Your heads—your tribes’ [Deuteronomy 29:9] [a pun:\nthere are no tribes where there are no heads]. How can a body remain\nintact when the head is sick! The body goes after the head.” And the\nGaon goes so far as to apply to the yeshiva the words of the Prophet\nHaggai (1:9) said with reference to the Temple of Jerusalem which\nthe Jews, faced with economic difficulties after their return from\nBabylonia, were loath to complete: “My house lies in ruins while you\nbusy yourselves each with his own house.\"22\n\nIt would be erroneous, however, to assume, as has so often been\ndone, that the rise of the local midrishim automatically meant the\nruin of the ecumenical yeshivas. The opposite is true. In no time did\nJewish learning flourish more in Qayrawin and other cities of Tunisia\nthen during the first half of the eleventh century when the great\nNissim b. Jacob (d. 1062) developed in Qayrawan the midrash of his\nfather?® and his older contemporary and compatriot Hananel b.\nHushiel wrote there the first comprehensive commentary on the\nTalmud (which still aderns any printed standard edition of that\nclassic).?* Yet from no period do we know of so many responsa going\nfrom Baghdad to Tunisia and of such rich donations sent from there\nto the yeshivas of Iraq and Palestine as from the first decades of that\ncentury.

As early as 985, that is, at\nthe very time when Sherira Gaon wrote the letters summarized above,\nBaghdad was described by so keen an observer as the Muslim traveler\nal-Mugqaddasi as a city living on its past. There were ups and downs,\nbut Iraq and western Iran, which in early Islamic times had harbored\nthe majority of the Jewish people, continuously decayed from the\ntenth century until the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth finally\nput an end to their preponderance in the Islamic and Jewish worlds.\nPalestine, similarly tormented by incessant warfare, raids, and mis-\ngovernment from the later part of the tenth century, also became\nutterly unfit to serve as a spiritual center, until the yeshiva had to go\ninto exile and dispersed. It was not lack of support by the Jewish\ncommunities of the diaspora which brought about the eclipse of the\nyeshivas, but their gradual disappearance that necessitated the devel-\nopment of local seats of learning.\n\nThe local schools, it seems, held their courses mostly in the syna-\ngogues, although not necessarily in the main hall, as proved by the\nstory of the large mat ordered for the midrash of Elhanan b. Shemarya\n(see n. 18). Similarly, in Islam, down to and including the tenth cen-\ntury, teachers were regularly reported to have had their “circles” in\nthe mosques. In a letter of appointment of a synagogue beadle in Old\nCairo, the most important duty imposed on him was regular and ade-\nquate lighting of the synagogue, in order to enable the scholars to\nstudy during the night. This, too, has its parallels in Islam. In a query\naddressed to Maimonides from a city situated north of Jerusalem (such\nas Damascus or Aleppo), reference is made to a college building sep-\narate from the synagogue.

A scholar was a man\nwho had studied the whole Bible, in particular the books of the\nProphets and the hagiographic books along with the aids necessary\nfor a proper understanding of their language and purport. In addi-\ntion, he had to know the religious and civil law. The scholar was able\nto deliver a sermon, to write a highly literary epistle, and to serve as\nan assistant judge. A doctor of the law, usually a man bearing the\ntitle “member of the academy,” had studied the sources of the law\nand the learned literature expounding them and was therefore en-\ntitled to write a legal opinion on a question addressed to him. Only\npersons possessing this qualification were appointed to the posts of\njudges and spiritual leaders in larger communities.\n\nWe are in a position to know these courses of study in detail owing\nnot only to the voluminous mass of books and fragments of books\nfrom this period actually found in the Geniza, but also to the many\nbook lists preserved, which give an idea of the libraries of individual\npersons and the studies they presumably pursued. From all this mate-\nrial emerge the following facts:\n\nThe study of the Hebrew Bible, together with its commentaries, its\ntranslations in Aramaic and Arabic (which also served as commen-\ntaries), its homiletic expositions, and the special treatises devoted to\nit, formed the most important constituent of the general curriculum\nof any educated man. With it was closely connected the study of the\nHebrew language, its grammar and lexicography, and its practical\napplication in writing letters and poems. Many fragments of transla-\ntions into Arabic of the Bible, commentaries, and treatises give the\nimpression of being notes of students and teachers rather than fin-\nished literary products.\n\nIn this respect, there was a marked difference between the coun-\ntries represented in the Cairo Geniza and those of central Europe,\nespecially at the turn of the century from the twelfth to the thirteenth.\nJust as the Christian scholars in Europe began to neglect the study\nof the Bible because of their preoccupation with scholasticism, so,\namong European Jews, did the Bible, and, with it, the Hebrew\nlanguage, cease to be a subject of higher education when it became\nconfined to the Talmud and cognate disciplines.

Maimonides’ famous\ncode was not a “first,” as is often erroneously assumed, but the crown-\ning termination of a long line of development, which had begun four\nhundred years before him, in the eighth century, that is, at the same\ntime that the Muslim scholars tried to codify their own sacred law\n(or perhaps even a little earlier). During the tenth and eleventh cen-\nturies it became the fashion for Gaons, or heads of the Jewish acad-\nemics, to write monographs on special aspects of Jewish law. For the\nmost part these monographs were written in Arabic and used Muslim\nlegal terms. The outspoken didactic character of the monographs\ngives the impression that they were originally composed as lectures to\nundergraduate students, each course term being devoted to one or\nseveral special topics. Only a small fraction of these lecture courses\nwas devoted to religious ritual, such as liturgy and ritual slaughter-\ning, whereas the vast majority dealt with civil law, subjects such as\nlegal formularies, sale, gift, preemption, inheritance, money orders,\ncourt procedure, the dutices of the judges, and similar topics.\n\nThis emphasis on civil law had its good reasons. In the period\nunder discussion, Jewish legal practice still insisted on the ancient\nprinciple of collegial courts. Even the smallest matters, as we see in\nthe Geniza documents, were attended to by three judges. This could\nbe achieved only if there existed a considerable supply of laymen\nreasonably familiar with civil law. It was to these future puisne judges\nthat the lecture courses for everyday law were directed.\n\nIn this respect, too, there was a fundamental difference between\nthe countries of the Geniza area and those of central Europe. In the\nlatter, the Jewish communities, at least from the twelfth century, had\nonly limited legal autonomy. Therefore, the course of higher studies\ncontained not much of applied civil law. The French Jewish scholars,\nmany of whom emigrated to the Levant shortly after 1200, were often\nmore learned talmudists than their Eastern colleagues, but, because\nof their lack of practical training, made poor judges.?\n\nIn Eastern countries, too, opinion was divided as to whether the\nstudy of handbooks of the sacred law was sufficient preparation for\nits correct application, The controversies about Maimonides’ famous\nCode of Law is the best indication of this state of affairs.

When a new muqaddam was appointed to\nthe provincial town of al-Mahalla, he examined the ritual slaughterer\nand when he found him merely to have studied a handbook on the\nsubject, disqualified him and relieved him of his post, but promised\nto teach him the relevant sections of the Talmud.? Similarly, a\nlearned Yemenite living in Egypt vehemently attacked Abraham,\nMaimonides’ son and successor, for his failure to quote the talmudic\nsources in his public lectures.t The general trend in the East, how-\never, was to base the first stage of higher studies on codified law. Only\nthe select few, those who prepared themselves for the posts of judge\nand spiritual leader, made extensive studies of the Talmud and the\nliterature that accrued around it. In Yemen this system of study pre-\nvailed until the termination of the Jewish settlement in that country.\n\nA similar controversy raged concerning the upper stage of higher\nstudies. Since the conclusion and canonization of the Talmud, both\nthe practice and theory of Jewish sacred law had undergone changes.\nThese changes were largely embodied in the responsa, or learned\nopinions, issued by the yeshivas of Babylonia and, to a smaller de-\ngree, of Palestine. Collections of these opinions appear regularly in\nthe Geniza booklists and, as their titles show, were arranged accord-\ning to different principles. Either they would bear a general designa-\ntion, such as “Correspondence with the Academies,” or indicate the\ntowns to which the learned opinions were sent, such as “Answers\ngiven to,” or “Questions asked by the Scholars of Sijilmasa [Mor-\nocco),” or “Qayrawan [Tunisia};” or expressly stated would be the\nnames of the scholars submitting queries or those of the heads of the\nacademies replying to them, or both. Later, arrangements according\nto subject matter became the standard practice. Sometimes, an an-\nswer would run the length ol a whole book.?\n\nWherever feasible, learned opinions were based on detailed dis-\ncussions of the relevant passages in the Talmudic literature, which\nwere usually quoted in full. There thus arose the question whether\na scholar dealing with a problem of the sacred law was bound to\nconsult the ancient sources, or whether it was permitted, or even\npreferable, to base one’s decision on a responsum of the heads of the\nacademies, which in any case would quote the pertinent source ma-\nterial. Ibn Migash, the leading Spanish Jewish scholar of the twelfth\ncentury (d. 1141), decided in favor of the second alternative, espe-\ncially for persons whose command of the unwieldy mass of talmudic\nliterature was doubtful. By chance, the correspondence about the\ncontroversy which seems to have led to Ibn Migash’s famous ruling\nhas been found in the Geniza. During frequent visits to Spain, the\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Nethanel ha-Levi conversed with the\nsavants of that country about topics ol law, theology, and poetry.\nOnce, one of them, whom he had referred to a responsum of the\nGaons, retorted in an unusually impolite letter that legal matters\ncould be decided only by recourse to the primary sources found in\nthe Talmud. He would prove it by submitting the matter to the Rav,\nmeaning 1bn Migash.” The writer does not give the impression of\nbeing a particularly competent scholar, which would explain Ibn\nMigash’s ruling that it was safer to rely on the considered opinion of\na late authority than to follow one’s own lights in the interpretation\nof ancient sources often difficult to understand. Anyhow, Ibn Mi-\ngash’s decision must have reflected the general trend of opinion in\nhis time. Otherwise, the book lists in the Geniza would not contain\ncollections of responsa as frequently as copies of the Talmud itself.\nClearly, the responsa formed a major subject of the upper stage of\nhigher studies.\n\nIn educational methods, learning by rote the exact wording and\ncantillation of an ancient text was regarded as a prerequisite for its\nproper interpretation in higher studies, as it was in the elementary\nschool. To us who make practically no use of learning by heart in\nhigher education this attitude seems strange, but it was based on old\ntradition and regarded as the only sound method.® How deep-rooted\nsuch pedagogical convictions are was brought home to me while\nvisiting a school of Moroccan Jews in Jerusalem which had a good\nreputation. To my amazement the boys recited by heart long pas-\nsages from the Talmud—complicated legal discussions in a mixture\nof Aramaic and Hebrew—without knowing a single word of the con-\ntent (enhancing the excellence of the performance in the eyes of\ntheir teacher). When he perceived that the visitor seemed to be less\nenthusiastic, he was astonished and asked: “Does your honor not\nknow that trying to reason and to interpret a text before knowing it\nby heart is damaging to the brain?”\n\nAnyone who visited the Muslim University of al-Azhar in Cairo\na few decades ago remembers a courtyard full of students running\nabout memorizing texts. How far they understood the contents, I\ndo not know. One whom I asked was perplexed at the very question.\nBut one should not generalize.\n\nAccording to a letter of Sherira Gaon, the interpretation of texts\nwas done by the students preparing questions at home which they\nwere to ask the teacher in class. When the students failed to compose\nappropriate questions, the teacher would suggest some himself.? The\ngreat institution of the responsa was mainly a continuation of study\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The corres-\npondence with the yeshiva of individual scholars or those of a city\nrepresents a continuous dialogue that includes references to previous\nletters, sometimes also to those of other scholars forwarded by the\nwriters,10\n\nDictation by the teacher or his “interpreter” was the normal pro-\ncedure in the Muslim madrasa, but, as far as we know, not in the\nJewish schools of higher learning. There the students kept a personal\ndiary, called by the ancient Hebrew term megillat setarim, or “secret\nscroll,” in which they recorded whatever seemed worth noting. When\nthey themselves became masters some would continue to note their\nsolutions of problems or answers to questions addressed to them or\nany other scholarly matter worthy of record. It is reported of several\noutstanding men, including Maimonides and his son Abraham, that\nthey kept scientific diaries of this type. The most famous case is the\nMegillat Setarim, the Secret Scroll, of Nissim b. Jacob of Qayrawan,\nwhich was published during his lifetime and which became a classic,\nquoted and discussed by scores of medieval authors. Since the master\nhad written down the notes at random (or rather in the sequence he\nhad studied the topics, it was necessary to provide them with a “key”\nindexing them according to subject matter. One such key has indeed\nbeen found in the Geniza.!! The notes were written partly in Hebrew\n(particularly those discussing classical texts) and partly in Arabic\n(mostly answers to actual questions or observations on popular us-\nages and cognate matters). Interestingly, as proved by various Geniza\nfinds, the Secret Scroll was published in two separate parts, one in\nArabic and one in Hebrew. The Hebrew section, I assume, was pre-\npared for readers in Europe who could not read Arabic.12\n\nAlihough the most prominent contributions to Jewish theology\nand philosophy happened to be made by scholars heading yeshivas,\nthese subjects seem not to have formed part of the regular syllabus\nof the establishments for Jewish higher studies.

In principle, however, it was not public service that\ndistinguished them and made them eligible for emoluments from\nthe communal chest and gifts from private persons, but the very fact\nthat they devoted time to study which others would use for worldly\ngain, It was for this reason that the community regarded it a sacred\nduty to contribute to their upkeep. The legal definition of a town,\nas opposed to a village, in Jewish law is that it was a place that had\nat least ten batlanim, “persons who do not work,” which means, who\nrenounce or reduce their profitable occupations for the benefit of\nstudy and the service of the community.!

The donation of an orchard for the bené Torah in\nDamascus, described in Med.

In general, the Gaon explained, the title was not given by him\npersonally, but by the governing body of the yeshiva as a whole.\n\nAs we have seen, a large city harbored many fellows of the aca-\ndemy. Therefore, it was found desirable to distinguish the leading\nscholar or scholars by specific titles, usually conferred on them at the\nsolemn assembly on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem on the seventh .\nday of the Feast of Tabernacles.!3 In his later days Nahray b. Nissim,\nthe scholarly merchant-banker, attained the title “senior of the aca-\ndemy,” with which he was often addressed (instead of his name).*\nA member of the academy who also acted as the communal leader\nin a large city was honored with the title “eminent member,” which,\nwithin the yeshiva itself, was given to an outstanding scholar when\nthere was no vacancy for him on the board of seven heading the\ninstitution. Since a very large proportion of the official correspon-\ndence preserved in the Geniza was addressed to “eminent members,”\nit has been assumed that the yeshiva was lavish in conferring the\nhonor. A more attentive examination of the material concerned\nshows that this was not so. As far as Fustat and Cairo are concerned,\nonly five dignitaries, each of whom led the Jewish community for\nprolonged periods, have been found bearing that title during the\nyears 1030-1112.%5 In a highly official public document from Fustat\nreferring to the years 1127-1129, the communal leader is repeatedly\ncalled rabbéni ha-me‘ulle, “our master, the eminent” (with omission\nof his name), indicating that only one scholar in the city bore that\ntitle.1$ Similarly, an “eminent member” stood at the head of the\nJewish community in the greatest port city of Lebanon in those days,\nTyre, another in that of Palestine, Ascalon; a third one in Baniyas,\nthe frontier fortress that protected the sources of the Jordan. This\ncommunity (like that of Old Cairo) consisted of a Palestinian and a\nBabylonian congregation, the latter probably having emigrated to\nBaniyas from Tarsus in Asia Minor, when this town was taken by\nthe Byzantines.” The controversial judge of al-Mahalla, referred to\nabove, also an “eminent member,” was certainly a Palestinian.18 One\nor two other instances of that title occur whose date and place have\nnot yet been identified.!? In the list of dignitaries and notables, Ap-\npendix C, section 26, four persons are called “eminent member,” but\nthese were the two chief judges of Fustat, that of Cairo, and one\nstyled “Ibn al-Sullami, head of the havérim, the hasid (pious),” prob-\nably the leader of a pietist brotherhood.?0 The title remained rare to\nthe end.2!\n\nThe honorary epithet “scholar” (talmid, an abbreviation of talmid\nhakhamim, “disciple of the sages\"), which originally designated\n\nGoitein, S.

Only in the thirteenth century,\nwhen titles had become cheap, does it appear frequently in the\nGeniza records.??\n\nThe Jerusalem academy conferred a few other titles on distin-\nguished members, but to discuss them here would lead us too far\nafield and, as the Geniza shows, only a small minority of the members\nof the academy were so honored. The Babylonian academies had\ntheir own system of titles. We have already learned of the most im-\nportant of them: “the head ol the seder.” * In comparison with those\ngiven by the Jerusalem yeshiva they are scarce, which may have its\nsimple explanation in the fact that the Geniza was a depository of\nwritings attached to the synagogue of the Palestinians.\n\n‘Trying now to describe the various occupations of the scholars,\nwe are puzzled by the fact that one official often carried out tasks\nnormally connected with another office, while, vice versa, persons\nbearing different designations would fulfill the same function. This\nphenomenon is typical for medieval times in general. In the Geniza,\nhowever, where life is disclosed to us in minute details, this diversity\nis particularly manifest. Moreover, the offices and their designations\ndid not remain unchanged during the period represented in the\nGeniza records. During the eleventh century the system was remark-\nably fluid, the twelfth had a more institutional character, while the\nrapid decline of Egyptian Jewry during the thirteenth century again\nnecessitated changes. Therefore, the short survey of the occupations\nof the scholars given below is a mere outline, and cannot do full\njustice to a far more variegated reality.\n\nIn the early years of the Geniza period, the spiritual leader of a\nJewish community often had no particular designation at all. He was\nreferred to as “the member of the academy assigned to such and such\na town.” 2 Later on, his most common title was “dayyan,” or judge,\nas presiding over a court handling cases of civil law was the most\nconspicuous and authoritative aspect of his office. One should bear\nin mind, however, that the Hebrew term also covers decisions in the\nfield of ritual law and even theology.\n\nAs we shall see, the courts, as a rule, sat only twice a week. Only\nmarriage contracts and divorces were normally dealt with outside\nthe regular court sessions. The dayyan could therefore devote most\nof his time to study and teaching, regarded as his main duty. “Study,”\nthat is, learning in company with other scholars, “should not be in-\nterrupted even for one hour,” is a quotation from a letter of the very\nprominent judge Baruch b.

When he himself was kept busy with communal affairs (about\nwhich we learn from a number of his other letters), he had his young\nson substitute for him in the local house of learning.2 Some Geniza\npapers seem to indicate that students and scholars attended court\nsessions as part of their course of study.\n\nSermons and public lectures were by no means the exclusive do-\nmain of the “judge,” but formed a regular part of his routine work.\nThe large number of books on homiletics, found in the library of\nthe “deputy” judge of Sunbat (Lower Egypt) in 1150, proves that\neven in a little town preaching required careful preparation.28 More-\nover, the dayyan was expected to speak at happy family events and at\nfunerals, a task sometimes felt as onerous by him as occasionally by\nhis modern colleagues.2?\n\nThe judge was also in charge of the social services of the commu-\nnity, He had to take care of the orphans and widows, the poor and\nthe sick, foreigners and captives and other persons in trouble. In\nthis respect, a profound change is to be observed during the Geniza\nperiod. Until the middle of the twelfth century, these services were\nentrusted by the community to laymen, with the judge acting as\nsupervisor and coordinator; by the end of the century we find him\nadministering them in person and managing the funds connected\nwith them. This change was certainly attributable to the influence\nof the model of the Muslim qadi, and also to the intrinsically insti-\ntutional character of the later period.28\n\nFinally, the dayyin was a community leader and represented his\nflock before the local and central officials of the government and\nbefore the territorial and ecumenical authorities of the Jews. As\nsuch he had to deal with legal cases that transcended his powers and\nwith administrative matters of all descriptions; and as such he was\naffected by the vicissitudes befalling government officials and the\nJewish authorities, in other words, he was involved in politics—a\nstate of affairs that some enjoyed and others detested.\n\nScholars of repute were approached with requests to give legal\nopinions on questions of civil and ritual law and, to a lesser degree,\nof religious belief and ethics. Maimonides wrote innumerable re-\nsponsa while both in and (perhaps even more) out of office. A Spanish\nrabbi, who served as justice in Old Cairo about a hundred years\nbefore Maimonides, was asked such questions by scholars from a\ncountry as far away as Yemen (which, to be sure, was in close contact\nwith Egypt owing to the India trade).?® Still a hundred years earlier,\na scholar from Spain living in Egypt wrote learned answers to ques-\ntions submitted to him from various quarters.30 The Geniza has\n\nGoitein, S.

Eliakim, who was prominent there a hundred and\ntwenty years later, and to the latter’s contemporary Anatoli of\nMarseilles, who was judge in Alexandria.3! A learned judge in Pa-\nlermo, Sicily, and the head of a school in al-Qayrawin, Tunisia, gave\nexpert opinions in a legal case occurring in Egypt.32 It was not the\nprovenance, habitat, or official position of a scholar, but his reputa-\ntion that conveyed on him religious authority.\n\nIn view of the manifold aspects of the office of dayyan or haver, it\nis to be expected that some should have preferred to specialize in one\nfield or another, as is evident from the details provided in the Geniza\nfor individuals bearing these titles. Mere study (which always in.\ncluded the readiness to lead courses for adults) was regarded as a\nsufficient means for a livelihood, even in provincial towns.?\n\nA post that particularly lent itself to specialization was that of the\npreacher.* While the sermons connected with the regular synagogue\nservice were usually given by the local judge or judges, there were\nmany occasions for visiting scholars or professional itinerant preach-\ners to appear before an enlarged audience composed of the members\nof more than one congregation. Visiting preachers sometimes repre-\nsented a strong moral force, similar to that demonstrated by their\ncontemporary Christian and Muslim counterparts.33 When Abraham\nMaimonides was asked to excommunicate a preacher from Baghdad,\nwho was active in Damascus and had there condemned the writings\nof his great father, he refused to do so, because the man “by his\ndiscourses drew the hearts to the fear and service of God and awoke\nsinners to repentance.” 3¢ Several Geniza papers show us itinerant\npreachers clashing with the local divines. A preacher from Basra,\nIraq, once agitated against the leader of the Jewish community in\nOld Cairo and against the heads of the Jerusalem academy, who had\nappointed and later confirmed him in his office. The militant Basrian\nwas excommunicated by the head of the academy for his actions. The\npastoral letter announcing this decision was addressed to a small\ntown in Lower Egypt, which shows that the preacher had not dis-\ndained to extend his visits even to communities of very limited size.87\nIn a complaint sent by members of the two Jewish congregations of\nAlexandria to the Nagid, the writers sided with the visiting preacher\n(also an Iraqian) against the local judge, who had left demonstra-\ntively in midst of the sermon. because he was critical of the visitor's\ninterpretation of the Holy Scriptures.38\n\nGoitein, S.

For two appearances, made during the au-\ntumn holidays, he received 10 dinars and 1 dinar for expenses—a\nhandsome sum, which a schoolmaster could make in about half a year\nof laborious work. The preacher’s pay tallies with a report from the\nlittle Egyptian town $ahrajt, where a scholar who stayed only one\nregular Sabbath for one sermon, made 7 quarter dinars and 100\ndirhems, a total of about 4-14 dinars.3® When a young scholar from a\nprovincial town was given the honor to read a discourse before the\ntwo congregations of Old Cairo, he obviously received no remunera-\ntion, for in a letter to his wife, which contained a report about the\nlecture, he boasted of his success (regretting that she was not there\nto witness it); had he obtained, in addition to applause, also an hon-\norarium, he would scarcely have failed to mention it as well.4®\n\nA successful public lecture by a guest speaker, then as today, re-\nquired careful preparation. Various Geniza letters illustrate this fact.\nOne, puzzling at first sight, may suffice. Eli b. Amram, the spiritual\nleader of the Palestinian congregation of Fustat during the third\nquarter of the eleventh century, writes to the head of the other con-\ngregation that he intended to invite a distinguished havér visiting\nthe city to “beautify” the synagogue on the following Saturday by “a\nword of the Torah” and he asks the addressee—confirming what was\nalready conveyed to him orally—to chair the affair. In reply to his\nletter he expects a definite answer so that he may go ahead in making\nthe necessary arrangements. The astonishing feature of this highly\nelaborate letter is that it was written at all, for the offices (and homes)\nof the two dignitaries could not have been more than a few hundred\nyards apart. No doubt, the letter was sent, and a written answer was\nexpected, in order to make the joint venture strictly official #*\n\nThe lecturers themselves took no chances and sent out personal\ninvitations to notables and divines (who do not always seem to have\nbeen eager to attend). Three such invitations, very different in style\nand tone, have been found by me thus far. In addition to the two\nmentioned before (see n. 42), which are written in flowery Hebrew,\ninviting the addressee together with his sons, there is one in Arabic\nin which the preacher describes himself as coming from a distant\ncountry and being different from the usual crop of wandering schol-\nars (“to be different” seems not to be an invention of modern ad-\nvertising). The invitation, addressed to the parnis of the Cairene (not\nFustat) community, is formulated in the most urgent terms, sug-\ngesting that the size of the audience depended on whether that influ-\nential man would decide to attend or not.#2\n\nGoitein, S.

In this Joshua echoed the\nviews of his illustrious ancestor, who denounced popular preachers\nwho took the Scriptures and the sayings of the ancient sages literally\nand, by thus misrepresenting them, brought religion into disrepute.*?\nIn several instances, cantors served also as preachers, and since, in the\nlate centuries of decay, a preacher would also take over the tasks of a\ndayyan, an outsider could get the impression that Jewish congrega-\ntions were led by cantors, as does the Muslim antiquarian al-Qal-\nqashandi (d. 1418) who tells us so in his description of the institutions\nof the Egyptian Jewish community.#4\n\n10.

Therefore, the adornments of life itself\nhad to take refuge in the places of worship. It was there that music\nand poetry found unlimited scope for realization. Unlike the brief\nMuslim prayer, the Jewish service, like its Christian counterpart, was\nextended in length even on workdays, let alone on Sabbaths, holidays,\nand special occasions. The official service was freely expanded and\ninterspersed with poetical accretions, often the work of a local hazzan\nor poet. The texts of the liturgy were chanted by different partici-\npants, or responsively by two or more singers, each of whom strived\nto show his musical talents. Jewish (and Muslim) sacred law pro-\nvided that every knowledgeable layman was fit to lead a community\nin prayer, but the Geniza papers show that even small communities\nhad a professional cantor, and often more than one.!

The course was to last three full\nyears and penalties were stipulated for both sides if the course was\nintcrrupted before its completion.3 Normally, cantors were prepared\nfor their future task in childhood.\n\nThe cantor’s equipment was both literary and musical. He had to\nbe competent in the reading of the Bible sections used during the\nservice together with their proper cantillation, in the liturgy of the\nwhole year with its melodies, and in the many religious injunctions\nconnected with both. Of course we should bear in mind that in those\ndays the liturgy was still in a very fluid state. While being transferred\nfrom one place to another, or even with a change of superiors, a\ncantor had to adapt himself to a new prayerbook.5 The text of the\nBible and its cantillation was not yet as rigidly fixed as it is in our\nprinted editions. In as late a period as the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury a cantor in Alexandria asks a colleague in Old Cairo to look\nup the Taj, the “Crown,” as the model codex preserved in that city\nwas called, in order to ascertain the exact reading and cantillation of\na passage. As a matter of fact, the cantillation indicated in that letter\nis different from that found in all our printed bibles.5 In the same\nperiod and in the capital itself, a reading approved by the Nagid\nAbraham Maimonides was contested by a scholar from Yemen.?

Religious poetry itself, we\nremember, became to be known in this period as hiziéna in Arabic or\nhazzaniith in Hebrew,\n\nSince the gift or the erudition needed for the composition of poems\nwas not everyone’s share, a cantor eager to satisfy the avidity of his\ncongregation for ever new experiences had to do so by selecting ap-\npropriate pieces from the diwans, or collections, of famous poets, or\nby recciving appropriate material from friends, or by abstracting\ncreations heard from colleagues. “I have left Damascus,” we read in a\nletter, “and intend to devote myself to the calling of a cantor. For\nthis purpose, 1 have borrowed the diwans of Solomon the Little (the\nfamous 1bn Gabirol) and of Judah ha-Levi—may their memory be\nblessed—and made excerpts from them for my use.” ° An old cantor\norders a liturgical poem for which he indicates the biblical verses\nwith which he wished each stanza to be concluded, but asks that the\nfinished product should reach him well ahead of the holiday, for his\nmemory was no longer as good as it used to be and it would take him\nsome time to memorize the poem. (Several other passages indicate\nthat the poems were recited by heart.) 11 Piyyiits for the New Year\nwere sent to a cantor in Fustat by “his son,” meaning probably a\nyounger colleague.12\n\nA letter written in Alexandria on February 4, 1214, contains inter-\nesting information of how the writer obtained material for the ad-\ndressee, a cantor in Old Cairo, who wrote poetry himself, of which\none long piece is preserved. The following passage from this letter is\nparticularly illustrative: “I am happy that the penitential poem has\nbeen received by you. However, the other one gives me great trouble.\nMay God help me to get hold of it. While my uncle chanted it during\nthe vigils, I observed that it began with the words. . . .13 But he never\nsings it on a weekday, when it might be written down, only on a\nSaturday or the Night of the Sacrifice of Isaac,’* when one is not\nallowed to write. By your good life, I have sent for it as far as\nMarseilles.” We have here a Hebrew liturgical poem, available in\nFrance, so cherished by those who had heard it in Alexandria, that\na cantor in Old Cairo who already knew of it was eager to obtain a\ncopy, but the colleague in Alexandria reserved the exclusive privilege\nto its use for himself.15\n\nAbove and beyond his intellectual and musical talents it was the\ncantor’s religiosity and moral conduct that counted.

This draft of a resolution recommending a cantor for perma-\nnent appointment is particularly telling. After stating that the man\nhad been tried out on Sabbaths, workdays, and holidays (in this se-\nquence) and had been found conforming to all the established re-\nquirements by the humility and beauty of his reading and the\nexactness of his rendering the sacred texts, the draft recommends him\nbecause of his “love of God, his religiosity, piety and virtuousness,\nhis pleasant manners, his eagerness to seek knowledge and excellence,\nand because he was loved by the people for his unblemished conduct,\nas was known to everyone.” 18\n\nThe accounts and other documents assembled in appendixes A and\nB contain many details about the emoluments of cantors, and not\nseldom do they head the lists of recipients. Since a main, if not the\nmajor source of their income was derived from conducting services at\nweddings, funerals, and other family events, however, it is difficult to\ngeneralize about their economic position. From the mass of material\npreserved the differences in status seem to have been many. There\nwere well-to-do hazzanim, and others who were wretchedly poor, and\nagain others whose fortunes seem to have been amazingly unstable.\nThe cantor and scribe Hillel b. Eli (sce sec. 11, n, 17; below) from\nwhose hand we have a number of personal letters, exemplifies the\nups and downs in a cantor’s life. He was in service for a prolonged\nperiod (at least from 1066 to 1108) and some letters show him enjoy-\ning an honored position. But others convey a different impression,\none, in particular, in which he complains of neglect by the commu-\nnity (quoting Isaiah 65:1) and of being afraid of the tax collector,\nproving that he had fallen on bad times.\\7\n\nLike modern virtuosos, cantors traveled from one town or country\nto another to demonstrate their art and to pocket the collections\nmade for them as their reward. A fledgling cantor writes to his mother\nin Fustat that she should not worry about him; he had just led a\ncongregation at Shubra and sung at a wedding in Damsis, and in both\ncases “God had sent” him a quarter dinar.'8 Private persons would\nshow their enthusiasm for a cantor by dropping into his hand a num-\nber of silver pieces, discreetly wrapped in paper.

A query addressed to Maimonides\ncomplains of a group of intoxicated cantors, who, while singing on\nthe platform in honor of a boy reading the lection from the Prophets,\nfilled the synagogue with giggles and raucous shouts. Another query\ndescribes a scandal that occurred for a similar reason.20 In the letter\nto the cantor who was so eager to get hold of the penitential poem\nfrom France, quoted above, we read the following laconic remark:\n“You mentioned in your letter that your illness was due to drinking.\nAn oath not to take any wine is certainly a good idea. In any case, 1\nshould rather recommend that you do not take too much of it.” 2\n\nSince the synagogue singers were so large and motley a crowd, it is\nunderstandable that the more serious members of the profession\nwished to be distinguished from their less well qualified colleagues.\nA fair number of cantors bore the title “expert” or “certified” and a\nfew were even members of the academy or were otherwise described\nas scholars.22 The senjor cantor was officially called “the great,” not\nonly in large cities like Baghdad or Fustat, but also in a provincial\ntown in Egypt.2? We also find the title “cantor with tenure” (App. A,\nsec. 155), as opposed to those of minor stature or peregrinators. The\ncantor of the private synagogue of the Nagid was called hazzin al-\nmajlis, “the cantor of the audience hall,” to be distinguished from\nhazzdn ha-keneseth, “the cantor of the synagogue,” a designation that\nhad a quite different meaning in ancient times.2* Cantors were occa-\nsionally given honorary epithets, similar in form to those borne by\nthe members of the Jerusalem yeshiva. Such titles were conferred by\na Nagid or any other Jewish authority and also by a local community.\n\nThe cantors, as we have seen, were busy travelers, and since they\nwere trained in making public announcements, they were used as\nofficial envoys both by the yeshivas and the Nagid.2* On their travels,\nsome, or perhaps many of them engaged in commerce, for travelers\nin those days normally acted also as carriers of goods.28\n\nFinally, there was a vast field of activities for cantors, which is per-\nhaps even more conspicuous in the Geniza records than it was in\nlife: as a liturgical writer, the cantor was required to be a linguist;\nno wonder then that he was often entrusted with the formulation of\nlegal deeds and court records. Countless such documents, written and\nco-signed by cantors, have come down to us from the eleventh\nthrough the thirteenth centuries.2? This position of court clerk led\nto many other kinds of employment. Cantors served as puisne judges\nand were charged with such minor juridical functions as visits to\nthe houses of women who had trouble in their married life. There,\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Any par-\ntaking of food was regarded as a communion with God, the giver of\nlife, and was therefore preceded by a benediction and followed by\ngrace. The preparation of animal food, which, according to the bib-\nlical account, man was allowed to eat only after Noah had used it as\nan offering, was regulated by minute injunctions, in many ways\nreminiscent of the ritual observed at sacrifices in the Temple of\nJerusalem. The animal had to be killed in a specific, expert way with\na razor-edged knife and a benediction had to be pronounced during\nthe operation, as was the case, incidentally, in Islam. Then the car-\ncass, and in particular the lungs, had to be examined carefully and\na large number of greasy substances, minutely specified, had to be\nremoved from various parts of the body together with “the sinew of\nthe hip” (Genesis 33:33). Finally, the meat had to be guarded from\nbeing contaminated or mixed with other meat, until it reached the\nconsumer.\n\nThus, three persons were engaged in this process: the shohet (in\nthe Geniza mostly referred to with Arabic terms), the slaughterer,\nwho performed the ritual killing and also examined the body of the\ndead animal; the “picker,” who identified and pulled out the impure\nsinews and other taboo parts; and the guard, who watched over the\nreat.3% The slaughterer, whose task was regarded as bearing extreme\nresponsibility and who also supervised his minor colleagues, was\nappointed by the community, but in larger cities he is never listed\nas drawing a remuneration from the public chest, for there he was\npaid by his customers, the butchers or other private persons. On the\nother hand, the “pickers” and guards appear regularly in lists; some-\ntimes four guards are listed at a time, for a guard also had to watch\nover the milking of goats and cows and the preparation of cheese,\nprocesses for which ritual purity was also prescribed.s?\n\nThe office of the religious slaughterer required manual dexterity,\nbut, even more, theoretical knowledge bordering on scholarship.\nEven familiarity with the relevant sections of the Talmud was re-\ngarded as obligatory, at least by some, a subject, we remember, that\ndid not belong to the regular “B.A.” curriculum of Jewish studies in\nthose days.38 Moreover, a shohet had to be a trustworthy person of\ngood conduct and acceptable to the community.

A negligent\n“examiner” in (New) Cairo retained his post solely by a special act\nof indulgence, but had to repent and to accept flogging in public,\n“to give God what is due to him.” 41\n\nIt lies in the nature of such age-old ritual matters that divergent\nusages and “schools” developed with regard to them. In western\nEurope (and of course also in America), most or all Orthodox Jews\ndo not consume meat from the hindquarter of an animal, and, there-\nfore, they have no need for the complicated procedures of “picking”\nalluded to above. The socioeconomic background for this practice is,\nof course, that in those countries there is no difficulty in disposing of\nthe forbidden meat with gentile butchers. In Yemen, where, until\ntheir exodus in 1949-1950, the Jews lived in separate villages and\nquarters where they were surrounded by a sect of Muslims with even\nstricter taboos, who would not even drink a cup of coffee touched by\na non-Muslim, the hindquarters had to be used, and, therefore the\nart of “picking” was as common there as in Egypt at the time of the\nGeniza documents. This is an elementary example of such differ-\nences, but there were others, more sophisticated ones, which might\nappear as minutiae to the outsider, but were of supreme concern to\nthe observant. Matters that were perfectly harmless according to one\nschool or “rite,” minhag, were absolutely taboo in another. In a de-\ntailed and most illuminating (but poorly preserved) letter by a Pales-\ntinian Gaon, he exonerates two slaughterers in Fustat who had been\ndisqualified in the strongest terms by his predecessor: after examining\ntheir case it became evident that they were conscientious and learned\npersons (they were also cantors), but followed a rite different from\nthat of their accuser. In another letter a Gaon emphasizes that he\nmust confirm in office all shohets and supervisors.42\n\nThe philosophically minded apostate Samuel, the Maghrebi, de-\nscribes with ridicule and scorn how a Jewish scholar, upon arriving\namong his coreligionists in a distant locality, would first of all refrain\nfrom partaking of their meat so that he would be regarded by them\nas particularly strict and learned and ended up, after much dissen-\nsion, as their leader whose rite they adopted.

Not everyone had the singular mind\nof a Maimonides who combined most rigorous ritualism with high-\nest intellectualism.*3\n\nThe administrative and financial aspects of the shohet’s calling\nare illustrated by a number of Geniza documents from the eleventh\nthrough the thirteenth centuries. The oldest known to me thus far\nis of a more technical nature specifying the conditions imposed on\nthe shohets licensed by the Palestinian congregation in Fustat (signed\nby six with room left for a seventh).#* In a “statute” made around\n1025, Husayn, alias Japheth, the cantor, son of the cantor David,\nreceives the post of ritual slaughterer and examiner, previously held\nby his late father, in two abattoirs “one near the Bath of the Mice\nand one on the Great Market.” Half the weekly income belonged to\nhim, the other half was to be put aside until a decision was reached\nabout its use by Joshiah, the Gaon of Jerusalem, Ephraim (b. She-\nmarya, called here “expert lay judge,” and not “member of the aca-\ndemy”), the leader of the congregation, and six other notables\nspecified by name. The agreement, as signed by the appointee, was\nread out to the plenum of the community. The fact that after the\ndeath of the father new, and not even definitive, financial conditions\nwere stipulated shows that the shohet’s income, like any other lucra-\ntive occupation in that competitive society, depended on agrcements\nrather than on fixed usages.*3\n\nIn the weekly accounts carried through a whole year, describzd in\nMed. Soc., Vol. I (App. D, sec. 58), a shohet pays 7 dirhems every\nweek to an official or other person designated by the community and\nreturns to it also the sums that it had spent for his poll tax (ca.\n1180).#¢ From a detailed account written about fifty years later we\nlearn that the same system still prevailed, namely, that the shohets\nmade payments to different officials including the Nagid (for distribu-\ntion to the poor), but we learn something about their income, too.\nFor every animal killed they received 2 dirhems—a sum large enough\nto purchase 2 pounds of meat. (This item invariably appears on the\nexpenditure side every week. Only once a shohet spent 2-14 dirhems\nfor meat, I assume because he had a guest. A pound of meat, at that\ntime, cost 1-14 dirhems, but it is clear that the shohets received a\nslight reduction. It is interesting to note that these killers of animals\npermitted themselves to eat meat at most at two meals during a week,\na pound being a reasonable minimum for a family of medium size.\n\nGoitein, S.

The difference in length does not mean that\ngetting a divorce was less expensive than concluding a marriage.)\n\nIn order to give an idea of the fees paid for commercial documents,\nan example from the same time, but from Palermo, Sicily, reveals\nthat for the writing of a deed of partnership in a consignment of pep-\nper worth 608 quarter dinars, 1 quarter dinar, then worth approxi-\nmately 9 silver dirhems, was paid.1?\n\n‘The cases cited represent remunerations for scribal services pure\nand simple. The fees were higher when legal action was involved.\nFor making out a deed for the sale of a house worth 60 dinars a Mus-\nlim notary received 1 dinar in 1088. There is little doubt that this\nincluded prerequisites for the five Muslim professional “witnesses”\n(‘udiil) who signed together with him and possibly also for one or\ntwo lower government officials.2\n\nA similar situation must be assumed when a husband traveling in\nCyprus (the man who was so outraged about his wife's negligence\nwith regard to the schooling of their boy [p. 174, above]) writes to his\n\nGoitein, S.

When the writer uses here a Muslim date (corre-\nsponding to Oct.-Nov., 1136), he means to say that by the time he\nreturned from his business trip the legal procedures should be com-\npleted and the get ready for delivery. Thus we understand why the\nfee offered by him for a bill of divorce was half a dinar, about twenty\ntimes as much as the one mentioned in the letter of the scribe from\nOld Cairo.13\n\nIn the letter just referred to, the scribe sends half the sums received\nto his superior. This seems to indicate that the clerks divided the\nfees among themselves irrespective of who did the actual writing.\nNormally, at least two scribes were attached to a court and also served\nas its assistant members. Even in the small Jewish community of\nDamietta, the Mediterranean port, two persons calling themselves\nscriveners signed a document in A.p. 989.'¢ From the still smaller\ntown of Sunbat in Lower Egypt, two documents from the year 1149,\nboth calligraphic and well formulated, were written and signed alter-\nnatively by two different scribes, one of whom is also called “deputy,”\nthat is, deputy judge.’ In a large community, like the one in Old\nCairo, there must always have been one chief court clerk, as the mate-\nrial covering about 240 years (1026-1266) indicates, for in each gen-\neration the number of documents drawn up by one individual out-\nnumbers by far those of the other scribes connected with the same\ncourt. The most prolific scrivener of Geniza records, from whose hand\nliterally hundreds of fragments or complete pieces have been pre-\nserved, was Halfon ha-Levi b. Manasse Ibn al-Qatd'if (dated docu-\nments, 1100-1138). He also copied, in Hebrew characters, an Arab\ncommonplace book by a tenth-century Muslim author, the original\nof which has not yet been found.!® Second to him with respect to\nmass of material preserved was his father-in-law Hillel b. Eli, some-\ntimes referred to as the cantor from Baghdad (dated documents, 1066-\n1108). The latter had an interesting personality, which cannot be\nsaid of the former. We are able to form a judgment about them, since\nprivate correspondence, both from and about them, has also been\npreserved.1?\n\nThe art of the medieval scribe, as evidenced in the Geniza records,\ndeserves detailed study, but can be sketched here only in bare out-\nline.

Linen as writing material has turned\nup thus far only in documents written in India or on the India route.\nThe practice of the Muslim scribes in Egypt (during the thirteenth\nand fourteenth centuries) of writing marriage contracts on linen\nseems not to have been imitated by their Jewish colleagues.’® Vellum\nand parchment were copiously used (see Med. Soc. I, 112), and also,\nalthough very rarely, reddish-brown leather. In documents on parch-\nment the four edges were not trimmed evenly, but the natural curves\nwere left especially on the right and lower edges. The long and irregu-\nlarly shaped blank spaces of parchment this practice created were\ntrimmed off after the document had served its purpose and were used\nfor drafts or copies, sometimes written in tiny letters.1?\n\nThe main writing material was paper, which is preserved in the\nGeniza in many different types, colors, and shapes. Anyone interested\nin the history of this prime means of communication will be richly\nrewarded by a study of the Geniza finds.2° In general, the paper was\ngood and suitable for preserving the ink well (better than vellum);\notherwise, these documents would have been unreadable after they\nhad become disused, neglected, and stacked away in a lumber room,\nwhere they lay for nine hundred years or so. People must have been\nsensitive in this matter because a writer using paper of poor quality\napologizes by saying that he was unable to find better.21\n\nPaper was traded in different sizes, sometimes referred to in our\nrecords (as “cuts,” gat’, or teqli) and as may be concluded from the\nuniform size of a great many court records belonging to one period.\nMostly, the scribes cut the paper to size according to their needs. It\nis remarkable how dexterous they were in gauging exactly the length\nof a document or of a letter. Usually only a very small part of the page\nwas left blank. The more experienced a scribe was, the better use he\nmade of the space at his disposal. Clearly, this was a matter of taste\nand not simply of thrift. Blank space was regarded as an offense to\nthe eye—except where it was intentional.?2\n\nIn letters, including official correspondence, more often than not,\nthe margins were neatly filled with writing, not, as we do, in scribbling\nafterthoughts, but, after having finished a page, the writer continued\non the right margin from the bottom to the top,?? very often- also on\nthe top itself, from right to left (in the direction of the Hebrew and\nArabic scripts) and only then turned overleaf to the completion of\nhis text. In documents, narrow margins were preferred.

When two, three, or four leaves\nof paper had to be glued together, the copyist endeavored—and almost\ninvariably succeeded—in arranging his lines in such a way that one\nline covered the edge separating the two leaves so that the upper part\nof the letters appeared on the first leaf and the lower on the second.\nSometimes, he would also write the word emeth, or “truth,” or a\nsimilar expression, or his name on the margin across the join of the\nsheets and would note at the end the number of sheets and lines.25\nOwing to these precautions, the different leaves, if separated, could\neasily be identified as parts of one larger unit.

Moreover, in re-\nusing a sheet the writer would cut it according to his needs; often in\nthe process the date and other valuable elements of the original docu-\nment were lost.

Another that now appears brown is also rather\ncommon,\n\nUnlike the preparation of ink, the proper cutting of the pen was\nan intrinsic part of the scribal art. Its thickness and the resulting\nshape of the letters had to conform to the size of the paper, and the\nharmony reached in this respect (by scribes of whose work we have a\nsufficient number of different specimens) is often apt to evoke our\nadmiration. Only seldom, when the scribe realized that he would\notherwise be unable to finish a document on one page or a long busi-\nness letter on two pages, would he exchange a fine pen for the formerly\nused heavy one.3? Not every reed would do for a good pen. Reeds\ngrowing in the lake of Maryit near Alexandria were particularly\nsought after. “As to the reeds of Maryiit,” writes a fellow of the acad-\nemy, an excellent calligrapher, to a revered scholar in Old Cairo,\n“they are still fresh and cannot be cut until the month of Av (July-\nAugust). I shall send for the reeds and cut them myself into pens and\nsend them to you.”s3\n\nThe subject of the various scripts displayed in the Geniza docu-\nments requires a discussion of Hebrew palaeography, which falls\noutside the scope of this book. Two remarks may suffice. An Arab\nscholar of the tenth century compared the art of the scribe with that\nof the musician, who weighs the different musical movements, some-\ntimes mixing the heavy movement with the light, sometimes follow-\ning other procedures, but always displaying a fine degree of sensi-\ntivity,3¢ It is a most appropriate comparison. The medieval scribe’s\ncreations are often music to the eye for he was an artist not less than\na scholar. The combination of the callings of cantor and scribe noted\nin subsection 10, above, might also have had its reason in the fact that\nboth aimed at beauty.

In\nPalestine and Syria, a distinctive, sharp-angled script resembling a\ncompromise between the new cursive and the old quadrangular\nevolved during the eleventh century. In Spain, more than anywhere\nelse, the Hebrew (as well as the Latin) cursive acquired a flowing ap-\npearance reminiscent of Arabic script. If my assumption is correct,\nthe origin of the Hebrew cursive in the Babylonian academies would\npresent a parallel to the role of the European universities in the de-\nvelopment of writing.\n\nThe language and style of the Geniza scribes can be studied con-\nveniently, since the more prominent ones have left us both documents\nand letters written in their hands. Four different worlds have blended\nin their modes of expression. They combine the exactness and terse-\nness of the jurists with the matter-of-factness apparent in the corre-\nspondence of businessmen, and they were the disciples of the great\nmasters of synagogal poetry (an art cultivated also by some scribes),38\nand, at the same time, heirs to the vast tradition of Arabic artistic let-\nter writing.

In letters\nwritten by experts, the introduction, or rather the introductions—for\nthere are often two, one in Hebrew, and one in Arabic—are mostly\nprolix and extended and often embellished by lines in thymed prose\nand sometimes even in verses (these embellishments are invariably in\nHebrew).

Both\nthe Arabic and Hebrew parts of the name of a person consisted of\nvarious constituents. The scribes, using this possibility for variation,\nwould introduce a person by one name and later refer to him by an-\nother, not mentioned before. An Abu 'l-Faraj mentioned at the be-\nginning of a document appears later as Joshua, a Japheth as Hasan\n(969), an ‘Imrin as ‘Umayra (before 1038), 2 Solomon as Salman\n(1049), an ‘Alldn as Eli (1057), an Azhar as Y&'ir (1072), and 2 Bii\nNajm as Hillel (1207).43 These Arabic-Hebrew equivalents were\nhardly stereotyped: the most common equivalent of Abu ’-Faraj was\nnot Joshua, but Yeshii'a, and the Hebrew name Solomon was ren-\ndered in Arabic by Salima or Sulaymén or even Tamim (which was\nbelieved to express the meaning of the Hebrew name). Variation was\ntherefore conducive to ambiguity.# Even the prominent judge and\nscholar Nathan b.

The writer wanted also to take\nback three quires given to another copyist, a cantor, whether used or\nnot. There is, however, no demand to return “the gift made for the\ncopying of the diwan.”\n\nIn a document from the first half of the eleventh century, the copy-\ning of the eight books of the Prophets (the second section of the\nHebrew Bible) is remunerated in the following way. At the outset the\nscribe received two gold dinars as well as some silver coins and a gar-\nment valued at another dinar.

For the\nmain concern of man in those days was religion, and consequently\nit was excellence in this field which was honored most. The physician\nhad another feather in his cap. Almost any doctor of distinction was\nalso a member of the entourage of a caliph, a sultan, a vizier, a gen-\neral, or a governor.

The more doctors around, the more knowledge was\navailable, and the better the prospects for its successful use.\n\nThis strong belief in the efficacy of the ancient sciences was not\nconfined to the upper classes.

It would be entirely fallacious to\nattribute this to human nature in general and to the truism that “all\nthat a man has he gives for his life” (Job 2:4).

There, however, philosophy survived as the maidservant\nof theology. In the course of the centuries the buxom maid out-\nstripped the fading mistress, and medicine, together with other sci-\nences, progressed with mighty strides, albeit against heavy odds.\nDuring our eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, there was no\nappreciable difference between the northern and southern shores of\nthe Mediterranean. As the Geniza shows, a doctor from Egypt could\npractice his art freely in Byzantium,! and as early as the tenth cen-\ntury we find a physician at the head of the Jewish community of Bari\nin southern Italy, a town famous for its religious scholars.2 A con-\ntemporary and compatriot of this physician, the famous Shabbetay\nDonnolo of Oria, has left a Hebrew treatise on mixtures and potions\n(based on Greek, not Arab, tradition), perhaps the earliest extant\nmedical work from Christian western Europe.® The medical schools\nof Salerno, near Naples, and Montpellier, southern France, were\nlargely, if not mainly, secular institutions, and before the eleventh\ncentury was over the writings of the major authors on medicine in\nArabic were known there in Latin translations.

Still, the study\nand practice of medicine penetrated Islamic civilization more than\nthe Christian countries of Europe during the tenth through the\ntwelfth centuries.\n\nIf medicine was a prominent constituent of Islamic civilization\nduring its creative period in general, it was absolutely paramount in\nthe life of the so-called protected communities, the Christians and\nthe Jews. An often-quoted statement of a Muslim visitor to Egypt in\nthe forties of the thirteenth century tells us that most of the (promi-\nnent) Christians and Jews of that country were either government\nofficials or physicians. A handbook for the market police, written\nshortly after that time, scolds the Muslims because many a town had\nno physician except members of the protected minorities.> Four and\na half centuries earlier, around 790, the following examples for\nlucrative occupations of non-Muslims are given in an Islamic legal\ntext: bankers, clothiers, landowners, big merchants, and practicing\nphysicians.® During the first 150 years of medical writing in Arabic,\nthe authors were almost exclusively Christians, some also Jewish, and\nlater on, the share of these two communities in the output of Arabic\n\nGoitein, S.

The secular leaders of the very important Christian\ncommunity of Iraq under the Abbasids were doctors, and the same\nwas true, as we shall presently see, for the Jews in Egypt under the\nFatimids and their successors.\n\nThe very first Fatimid caliph to rule Egypt and the neigliboring\ncountries, al-Mu'izz, had a Jewish physician, Moses b. Elazar, whose\nmarvelous concoctions had wrought wonders while he was still in\n‘Tunisia, that is, before 969.7 Moses, like Donnolo, was a native of\nOria, but was carried off in 925 by Muslim raiders from Tunisia\nwhen they sacked that south Italian city. At Qayrawan he became a\ndisciple of the famous medical writer and court physician Isaac\nIsraeli.8 Moses’ writings, among them one on pharmacopoeia, dedi-\ncated to al-Mu‘izz, seem to be lost, but some of his lengthy prescrip-\ntions were transmitted in the books of others. Having served two of\nal-Mu‘izz’ predecessors back in Tunisia, Moses became one of the\nmost influential personages at the new Iatimid court of Cairo, and\nhis position of physician in attendance was inherited by two of his\nsons and a grandson.® A great-grandson, also called Moses, was “phy-\nsician to the exalted Majesty,” namely of a descendant of al-Mu'izz,\nand at the same time “chief of the Jewish community.” These titles\nare found in a document from May, 1038, which states that the syna-\ngogue in the newly founded capital Cairo, like all other houses of\nJewish worship, were under the jurisdiction of the court physician.\nMoreover, we learn the interesting facts that it had been so for over\nforty years and that the synagogue building was surrounded on three\nsides by houses belonging to the doctor, his father, and his grand-\nfather, respectively. The document, which is preserved in the archives\nof the Jewish community of Cairo (not in the Geniza, as sometimes\nstated), cannot be an original from the Fatimid chancellery, as it\npretends, for its Arabic is too faulty for that claim.

Its most\nprominent member was the Nagid Abu ’1-Fadl Mevorakh b. Saadya.\nIn a letter written in or after 1067, his brother and predecessor Judah\nappears for the first time as “Nagid,” which, later on, became the\nofficial Hebrew title of the heads of the Jewish community in Egypt.13\nThe father of the two also had been a physician, and is always so\ndesignated in the signature of his elder son, and their learned mother\nmust have been an influential woman, since in an elegy on her death\nit was said that in her wisdom she succeeded in appeasing the wrath\nof the king.1* Mevorakh was succeeded by his eldest son Moses, also\na physician.\n\nThe first Nagid known to have borne this title in his capacity of\nhead of a Jewish territorial community was a medical man: Abraham\nb. Nathan, better known under his Arabic name Ibn ‘Ata’, who served\ntwo rulers of Tunisia as court physician (see chap. v, sec. A, 2, above).\n\nIn the middle of the twelfth century, the leader of Egyptian Jewry\nand one who loomed large in the Geniza (being second only to\nMevorakh) was the physician Samuel b. Hananya, well known from\nArabic sources under the name Abi Mansiir (in office 1140-1159).1%\nWhen the caliph ordered him to liquidate the rebellious crown\nprince by poison, both wisdom and the Hippocratic oath induced\nhim to disobey the caliph’s order. The Christian doctor who carried\nit out was executed shortly after having done his duty. Samuel’s\nfather and elder brother also had been doctors.

We find physicians in charge of local af-\nfairs in Tripoli, Lebanon, Ramle, Palestine, Alexandria, and various\nother towns in Egypt.20 Regarding the doctor and “head of the con-\ngregation” in Bari referred to above (p. 242), we read the interesting\ndetail that once, upon learning that a messenger from Spain had\nbeen robbed by brigands, he ascended his horse and pursued the\nculprits “with his men.” The scene of a physician carrying out police\nduties is more characteristic of tenth-century Italy than of the con-\ntemporary, somewhat more tightly organized Fatimid empire.\n\nThe survey of the physicians serving as community leaders given\nabove also reveals another aspect of the medical profession in the\nMiddle Ages: the prevalence of families of doctors. Many other ex-\namples could be adduced from the Geniza records, especially the lists\nof contributors, where, for instance, in one list, three or more physi-\ncians belonging to the same family live in one house, and the same\nis noted of two oculists, father and son (App. G, sec. 55, cols. 3, 6).\nTwo more examples: The doctor and judge Aaron b. Yeshii‘a Ibn\nal“Ammani of Alexandria, famous in Hebrew literature owing to\nthe beautiful poems devoted to him by the Spanish Hebrew poet\nJudah ha-Levi (who visited Alexandria in 1140), had two grandsons\nand two great-grandsons who were doctors, and it is more than likely\nthat at least one of his five sons pursued the same profession. His\nfather and great-great-grandfather Aaron, the founder of the al-\n‘Ammani family in Egypt, also were physicians, so that the medical\ntradition remained alive in the family for at least eight generations.2!\n\nIn a document dated 1378, the father, uncle, grandfather, and\ngreat-grandfather of the young lady Shams (“Sun”) are designated as\ndoctors, a fact recorded as a mere title of honor and without any\nconnection with the subject matter of the document (the sale by the\ngirl of a part of a house belonging to her).22 Needless to say, in the\nChristian and Muslim communities the same system prevailed. The\nrenowned Bukhtishia family of Christian doctors of Baghdad can be\ntraced through two and a half centuries and this is only one, al-\nthough the most illustrious, example of a general phenomenon.2*\nAnd a mere glance at Ibn Abi Usaybi‘a’s priceless History of the\n\nGoitein, S.

Even where no decline in social status was in-\nvolved, a son would often choose a career different from that of his\nfather. Still, families of doctors, as the Geniza proves, were more fre-\nquently found in those times than in our modern society, from which\nthey are not absent, as everyone knows.\n\nA physician is called in the Geniza vecords either tabib, the tech-\nnical term for physician, or hakim, “doctor of the sciences,” or both,\nthat is, he is referred to as “the illustrious doctor so-and-so, the\nphysician.” 25 A third term, mutatabbib, “medical practitioner,” is\nalso common, but is not used in the pejorative sense of a man without\ngeneral philosophical erudition, for we find that highly respected\nrepresentatives of the profession such as Abraham b. Isaac b. Furit,\nare also addressed in this way.26 The irritating passion for variety,\nobserved in the writings of the Geniza in general, was operative here\ntoo. It is noteworthy that the Hebrew term r6fé is very frequently\nfound, as occupations are not normally expressed in Hebrew words.\nThe Hebrew title appears often in signatures on documents as well\nas in memorial lists, in both of which, as a rule, only a dignity con-\nnected with religion or the service of the community is noted.

An aspirant to the medical profession, who had not yet re-\nceived permission to exercise it independently, was called mu‘allim,\nproperly translated as “master.” We read in a letter of an oculist to\nhis assistant, who was also his relative: “T heard that Menahem has\nalready been licensed, while you are still only a mu‘allim.” The letter\nitself shows that the oculist was rather helpless without his knowl-\nedgeable assistant, who had quit his service.2?\n\nDuring the entire Geniza period, doctors bore honorific titles spe-\ncific to their calling.

Since the heads of the Jewish community\nwere mostly doctors, it was presumably they who conferred those\nHebrew titles,32\n\nAs to the study of medicine, we must beware of applying modern\nnotions to medieval conditions, particularly in the Islamic world with\nits individualistic approach to higher studies. In order to work inde-\npendently as a physician one needed a license granted not by a uni-\nversity or a scientific corporation, which did not exist, but by a\nprominent physician, who was authorized by the government, nor-\nmally, it seems, by the chief of the market police, sometimes also by\nthe caliph in person.3\n\nThe ways in which the theoretical knowledge and practical skill\nneeded for the exercise of the profession were acquired varied widely.\nWe learn this from the biographies of physicians, which have been\nhanded down to us by the hundreds in the Arabic books devoted to\nthis subject. It is perhaps illuminating to contrast the first steps of\none court physician, as they are described to us by Ibn Abi Usaybi‘a,\nwith those of another physician, related in two Geniza letters, written\nby him as a young man. In the first case, the father, also a doctor in\nthe service of a caliph, paid his son a few dirhems every day and had\nhim bleed patients outside the door of his office, until he acquired\ngreat dexterity in this technique. Once, when a courtier needed bleed-\ning, the young man was invited to do the job in the presence of the\ncaliph—at the suggestion of his father, of course. He acquitted himself\nso gracefully that he was immediately admitted to the royal entour-\nage, in which he remained all his lifetime.3\n\nThe second case concerns the leader of the Jewish community, Hi-\nbat Allah-Nethanel, already mentioned.

His father, who was\na doctor, bribed him with the very large sum of 25 dinars never to\nleave his house, not even for a visit to the public bathhouse, and to\ndevote his time entirely to the study of medicine, language (i.e.,\nclassical Arabic and Hebrew), Talmud, and theology—in short, all an\naccomplished Jewish physician and scholar had to know. The letters\nsent by the young man during his confinement show that serious\nscientific interest had been aroused in him, although he complained\nbitterly about his separation from his boon companions.3%\n\nThe reading of public lectures to medical students seems not to\nhave been common practice. Where this was done, the biographers\nmade a special point of it. Ibn Jumay', the Jewish physician in at-\ntendance to Saladin, “held general meetings for all those who prac-\ntised under him the art of medicine.”’3¢ To be sure, Ibn Jumay' was\nregarded as the greatest medical authority of his century in Egypt and\nwas an enthusiastic teacher. Normally one or several students would\nget what we would call private tutoring from a physician of estab-\nlished fame and would also practice under his or another’s supervi-\nsion, the two aspects of study not always being combined. From a\nmost instructive letter, addressed by the father of such a student to\nMaimonides, we may conclude that it was not always easy to find the\nopportunity to study and practice under the guidance of a famous\nphysician. The writer of the letter stresses that he dared to apply to\nthe illustrious doctor and judge only because he had heard that\nMaimonides’ nephew, who had worked under him thus far, now\npracticed elsewhere. The writer also promised to pay Maimonides a\nhigher honorarium than the former apprentice.8?\n\nAs the example of Maimonides’ nephew and the biographies of\nmany doctors indicate, a student would change over from one mentor\nto another. A large part of the curriculum was covered by private\nstudy, which meant mainly memorizing the classics of medicine. One\nfamous Egyptian doctor even opined that studying from books was\npreferable to working under the supervision of teachers.?8 This opin-\nion, however, was not generally accepted.\n\nThe course of medical studies followed can be reconstructed, as far\nas the Geniza is concerned, from the inventories of doctors’ libraries,\nas well as from actual remnants of medical books preserved. In ac-\ncordance with the character of this study, which is based on docu-\nmentary Geniza material, we have to confine ourselves to the first\nsource of information.

Since the library of a Jewish doctor usually consisted of two\nparts, one Hebrew and the other Arabic, the auctions were held at\ntwo different meetings, gentiles taking a prominent part in the Arabic\nsale. In a number of cases, only the lists with regard to the Hebrew\nsection have been preserved, not surprising since the lists of Arabic\nbooks were usually written in Arabic characters and were therefore\nnot put away in the Geniza.3? In one example the lists concerning\nthe two auctions, held on two subsequent Tuesdays in the year 1223,\nhave come down to us.® In another, that for the Arabic books alone,\nhas been preserved. They were also auctioned on two subsequent\nTuesdays, November 13 and 20, 1190.41 Medical books also appear in\nvarious other lists.\n\nThe main impression to be gathered from these lists is the absolute\npreponderance of books of old and established authority. As D. H.\nBaneth, the judicious editor of the list from November, 1190, has\npointed out, the latest authors mentioned in it died around 120 years\nbefore the proprietor of that excellent library, which was by no means\na commonplace one but contained many books of both Greek and\nArabic medical writers which have not been traced thus far. The\nArabic translations of works of the Greeks, including above all Hip-\npocrates (fifth century B.c.) and Galen (second century A.p.), were of\nparamount authority. Studying medicine meant in the first place\nmemorizing selected writings of Hippocrates and even more of Galen.\nAt least 33 out of the 102 volumes sold from the 1190 library con-\ntained works by Galen. The serious sudent would not be content with\nthe compendiums and summaries of Galen’s work, prepared in the\nacademy of Alexandria in pre-Islamic times, but would study the\noriginal writings of the master together with their pre-Islamic and\nIslamic commentaries, as well as the later Greek authors and the re-\nnowned doctors of the Islamic period. Nor should we assume that all\nstudents of medicine in the Middle Ages were as exclusively devoted\nto classical books as was the doctor whose library was auctioned in\n1190. The library auctioned in Old Cairo on March 7, 1223, com-\nprised works of the Spanish Muslim Averroes, who died in 1198 and\nhad been a contemporary of the proprietor of the 1190 library. In the\n1223 inventory too, Galen far outstripped all other authors, to be fol-\nlowed by Hippocrates and then by al-Razi (d. 925), certainly one of\nthe most original representatives of Islamic medicine.\n\nIn order to complete his medical education a young doctor would\nseek work in a hospital. It must have been rather difficult to attain\nthis goal, to judge from the following details contained in a letter\nsent to a young “doctor” studying in Cairo, who strove to get an ap-\n\nGoitein, S.

In the Geniza—where it is written in Hebrew characters—the\nword is always abbreviated to maristan or maristan, as in less formal\ncontemporary writings and in spoken Arabic today. We know very\nlittle, if anything, of the Fatimid caliphs’ interest in this charity. Per-\nhaps they were too religious to try to take out of God's hand the care\nof human health, although they themselves were surrounded by physi-\ncians. Their successors, the Ayyubids, brought with them to Egypt\nthe Mesopotamian tradition that expected a ruler to endow or to\nmaintain a hospital, a tradition so magnificently followed by Nir\nal-Din Zengi, their former overlord. (His hospital, erected in Damas-\ncus shortly after 1154, continued to operate until 1899, and its build-\ning is still good enough to harbor a school.) In Fustat, the Geniza\npapers invariably refer to the hospital, even in a deposition in court\nwhere exactness is required, as if only one had existed there in\nFatimid times (“While passing by the hospital I saw . .. ”). This hos-\npital, like those in Iraq and Syria and those in Cairo known from the\nMamluk period, probably was divided into different wards, where\nfever, eye diseases, surgical cases, dysentery, and so on, were treated\nseparately, for even for Ramle, Palestine, we have an eleventh-century\nGeniza letter addressed to “the head of the dysentery ward.”4?\n\nWhile the Geniza makes repeated references to Jewish doctors\nworking in hospitals, it never mentions Jewish patients availing\nthemselves of this service. Most probably they refrained from doing\nso on account of the dietary laws. In those days, people would not\nagree to transgress the injunctions of their religion, even if recom-\nmended for health’s sake. A famous example of the attitude was Sala-\ndin, who refused to take wine, although one of his Jewish physicians\nhad prescribed it as a remedy against colic.48\n\nIn serious cases, the house of the doctor served as a substitute for a\nhospital to patients who could afford it, or who were his friends. In\na report on the death of a girl in Alexandria, sent to her grandparents\nin Fustat, her father describes how she stayed in the house of the\nphysician, who sent her home (“borne in a basket by a porter”) only\nwhen he recognized that her case was hopeless.®® Several references\nindicate that the prominent judge Nathan b. Samuel, the “Diadem”\n(dated documents 1122-1153, App. D, sec. 18) kept a private hospice\nfor sick and old people, but nowhere in the many Geniza papers re-\nlated to him is there a hint that he was also a physician.

An old woman turned over to R. Nathan her money\n(17 dinars) and other belongings on condition that he maintain her\nuntil her death and bear her burial expenses. And a day before he\ndied a man not related made a deathbed declaration in Nathan’s\nhouse.52\n\nSick, homeless foreigners would stay in a synagogue or even in a\nschool, and pious foundations were established for the purchase of\nmedicines for the poor.53 A physician was expected to treat needy\npersons without remuneration, as assumed in certain sayings ascribed\nto Hippocrates.

The fees range from\n3 dirhems a week for the treatment of a sore eye®! to a thousand dinars,\npromised to a Jewish physician in Tripoli, Libya, for the successful\nhealing of the sultan of Gabes, Tunisia. Of this sum, he was to receive\n100 dinars before he even left his own house. The physician, who\nobviously understood the nature of the illness from the description\ngiven, was so little eager to attempt a cure that he offered to the\nbedouin rulers of Tripoli a bribe of 50 dinars if they allowed him to\nignore the sultan’s summons. They insisted, however, that he treat\nthe sultan, and, in their rough bedouin manner, threw all the Jewish\nnotables of the town into prison and held them there until he would\ncomply. Finally the doctor, a father of four sons, set out on his peril-\nous expedition, but, fortunately for him, the sultan died before he\narrived.82\n\nBetween the two extremes described we find an honorarjum of 4\ndinars demanded by a Muslim physician for the treatment of a Jewish\ngirl who was affected by dropsy, and of 1 dinar paid monthly by a\nMuslim family to its Jewish doctor, about which the latter reports\nthis detail: “By chance, I befriended a man from Damascus who in-\ntroduced me to the family of Sayf al-Islam.

To be sure, at noontime the physicians left the hospital for\nhome and were free to attend to their private practice. An appoint-\nment to the hospital was perhaps sought for reasons of prestige.®\n\nA famous story in The Arabian Nights suggests that an advance\npayment of a 14 dinar for a single visit was regarded as very high. The\nhumorous story relates that a Jewish doctor, when told by his Suda-\nnese maidservant that a patient waiting downstairs was prepared to\npay that sum, became so excited that he sped down the staircase\nwithout taking a Jamp (it was nighttime) and in the darkness ran the\npatient over and killed him (or, rather, believed he had killed him).83\n\nThe British Museum contains an interesting contract made before\na Muslim notary, in which the proprietor of a Nubian slave promises\nto pay to the Jewish physician Makirim b. Ishiq b. Makirim (see\nabove) an honorarium for the successful treatment of the slave’s left\neye (June, 1245)—how much is not said. The fee perhaps depended\non the degree of satisfaction of the contractor. The idea that payment\nshould be made to a physician only after successful treatment is as\nold as the Codex Hammurabi (paragraphs 215 ff.), and presumably\nmuch older.8¢\n\nIt seems that the physicians were renowned for being greedy. A\ndoctor, who was also a muqaddam, or head of a congregation, and a\nnative of Jerusalem (both capacities associated with the task of col-\nlecting funds), writes jokingly to a friend: “Although I am a doctor,\na president, and from Jerusalem, so that all the reasons for being\nexacting are combined in me, I am not of this type, as far as you are\nconcerned.”87\n\nMany of the doctors appearing in the Geniza documents were in-\nfluential and affluent people. There were, however, others who pos-\nsessed only modest means or who were poor. Legal documents, such\nas wills or marriage contracts referring to doctors, or lists of contribu-\ntions to public appeals reveal their financial status, or it is stated ex-\npressly in letters.88 Competition was keen. A physician from Qalyib\n(about 12 miles north of Old Cairo), who had opened an office in the\ncapital, writes to his wife that the response of the public had been\nexcellent, but that the enmity of the other members of the profession\nwas so strong that he could not dare to interrupt his work even for\none day to come out and examine her sore eyes.8® Competition was\nwaged also in the form most congenial to Islamic civilization: in\nsatiric verses.

DRUGGISTS, PHARMACISTS, PERFUMERS, PREPARERS\nOF POTIONS\n\nOne need not delve deeply into the writings of the Cairo Geniza\nin order to discover that a great many of them refer to the professions\nconnected with the processing and sale of drugs, spices, perfumes,\nand potions for medical and culinary use. The occupations of ‘atar\n(from which English “attar of roses”), usually translated as perfumer\nor druggist, and that of sharabi (from the same root as English sher-\nbet), preparer and seller of potions, are among those occurring most\ncommonly in the Geniza.! The saydalani, also saydani, pharmacist,\napothecary, belongs to the same group, and there were specialists,\nsuch as the safiifi, or preparer of medical powders.2\n\nOut of ten persons whose occupations are mentioned in a list of\ncontributors (App. G, sec. 18), four are described as druggists (around\n1095). In the contemporary list C 19, four other druggists and two\napothecaries make their appearance. In the collection for wheat for\nthe poor, C 33, made in summer 1178, two ‘attirs belonged to the\nupper class of contributors, two to the middle, and three to the lower.\nWe should remember, however, that then as today a good drugstore\nserved as a landmark in a neighborhood (often used as an address in\na letter), and, therefore, its proprietor was usually referred to not by\nhis profession, but by his name, often the first only, or even a nick-\nname. This explains, at least partly, the strange fact that in G 40, out\nof 21 occupations mentioned, there were four ‘attars and four shar-\nabis, but in the contemporary list G 39 only one out of 105, and in C\n46, also closely contemporary, none out of 127 persons or firms listed.\nThere is no doubt that a scrutiny of the relevant Geniza material\nwould reveal that a number of persons mentioned in the last two\nlists (C 39 and 46) belonged to the professions discussed here, while\nthe ‘attars and sharabis occurring in the first (C 40) were probably\nnot prominent members of the community and were therefore iden-\ntified by their profession.\n\nIn the study of the economic and legal aspects of commercial and\nindustrial partnerships undertaken in Med.

Properly collected and studied they\nwould shed much light on those professions themselves. A few ex-\namples: An ‘attir rents a ground floor and a mezzanine for eight\nyears, making renovations worth 40 dinars, the equivalent of eight\nannual rents of 5 dinars. The house concerned was situated in (New)\nCairo, but the detailed document was written on July 27, 1150, in\nFustat, at that time still the spiritual capital of the Jews of Egypt.?\nAnother perfumer rents part of a communal building for a period of\nat least four years in order to use it for reservoirs for rose water\n(1180-1184) (see App. A, sec. 102).

If the synagogue\nwas first in importance as a social center of the community, the\nSquare was second. The very extensive, but much confused, notes\nabout the place in literary sources indicate that it underwent many\nstructural changes through the centuries, to be expected in a lively\nbusiness center. A letter to Ephraim b. Shemarya, the communal\nleader from the first half of the eleventh century so often mentioned\nin this book, is addressed to the Old Square of the Perfumers. And a\nletter to “the physician of the Murabba‘a,” whatever this may mean,\nisdirected to the Massisa, a neighborhood adjoining what the literary\nsources call District, khutt, of the Perfumers. Both that neighborhood\nand the Square bordered on the Fortress of the Candles, the original\nseat of the Christian and Jewish populations of the city, which also\nharbored the two main synagogues.20\n\nThe professions of pharmacists and druggists, as pointed out in a\nhandbook of market police, required much study and experience.2!\n‘Whether or not the ‘attar to whom the Alexandrian physician and\njudge Ibn al“Ammaini sent three volumes of Dioscorides wished to\nacquire them for himself we do not know.

This claim was strongly contested by a\nJewish druggist, known as Abu ’l-Muni al-Kohen al-‘Attar, who, in\nthe year 1259-60 wrote “for his own use and that of his son” a far\nlarger handbook of medicaments, based not only on books, but also\non his own observations.?* Kohen'’s book became even more popular\nand was printed in Egypt several times between 1870 and 1940, be-\ncause it served as guide to the traditional druggists of that country\nwell into the middle of the twentieth century. I should perhaps add\nthat, according to Dr. Max Meyerhof, who spent almost all his work-\ning life in Egypt, in modern times no longer did a single Jew or\nChristian have a store on the bazaar of drugs of Cairo. They had left\nthese outmoded ways of healing to members of the majority group.2s\n\nThe prominence of the Jews in the professions of druggists and\npharmacists during the High Middle Ages—which is paralleled by\ntheir equally strong representation in the fields of medicine on the\none hand, and in that of the international trade in spices and drugs\non the other—calls for comment. There is no reason to assume that it\nrepresented the continuation of a pre-Islamic tradition. When a say-\ning in the Talmud extolls the profession of the bassam, which is the\nexact Hebrew equivalent of Arabic ‘attar, as the most desirable of\nall, this had, as the context referring to the craft of the tanner shows,\na specific reason of secondary importance. It simply meant to say that\nit was pleasanter to live in an atmosphere of sweet smells than to\nsuffer all one’s life the stench produced by the tanner’s work (as it\nwas in those days; I spare the reader a description).28 When we read\nthat a certain clan in Jerusalem knew how to compound the incense\nused in the Temple, but did not teach this art to anyone else, it does\nnot testify to any particular Jewish eminence in this profession. The\nkeeping of professional secrets by a specific group, clan, or firm is\nalso ubiquitous and commonplace today.2” The remarkable tendency\nof Arabicspeaking Jews of the High Middle Ages to embrace the\nprofessions of druggists and pharmacists must have had its source in\ncontemporary developments.\n\nTentatively, I offer this explanation: In the wake of the revival of\nthe Greek sciences in Islam on the one hand and the efflorescence of\nthe trade with India and the Far East on the other, medicine and\npharmaceutics witnessed an unprecedented exuberance. They were\nalmost new professions. It is a law of economic history that minority\ngroups have a chance of being successful in occupations not yet\nmonopolized by the more privileged classes of the society.

The comparatively new field of pharmaceutics, like those\nof the silk industry and trade (see Med. Soc., I, 104), offered promis-\ning opportunities for the underprivileged.\n\nA subsidiary element might have been at work. The profession of\nthe druggist, as we have seen, was a bookish one. The use of hand-\nbooks was officially prescribed and actually practiced. And there was\nthe great Dioscorides and other learned compilations on the subject.\nJewish religion, too, as it developed in post-talmudic times, had be-\ncome very bookish. One could not be a good Jew without regularly\nstudying the Holy Scriptures and the postbiblical sources of Jewish\nlaw and rite. Thus there existed also a certain mental disposition for\nthe profession of the ‘attir. But I am not so sure about this point.\nFor in Islam there prevailed a similar situation, at least in theory.\n\nThe orders, accounts, bills, and letters preserved indicate that the\nstores of the druggists differed widely not only in size, but also with\nregard to the commodities they stocked, and indeed by their whole\ncharacter. Since it is impossible, at the present stage of research, to\npresent a comprehensive account of the profession, a number of\ndocuments apt to illustrate its various aspects are presented here.28\n\nA court record tells about a case where a physician prescribed in\nthe store of a seller of potions. 1 have the impression that indeed\nmany, if not most, of the prescriptions in Hebrew characters pre-\nserved in the Geniza were written by druggists according to the in-\nstructions of physicians who then added, in Arabic script, the name\nof the patient, sometimes also a pious wish, by way of confirmation.\nIn some cases we may even be able to identify the handwriting of the\ndruggists who wrote the prescription.2®\n\n1 present here the full text of a prescription that I assume was\nwritten by a pharmacist and confirmed by a physician. It is short and\ncomposed mostly of ingredients that were rather humdrum in those\ndays, appearing frequently in prescriptions, accounts, and interna-\ntional business correspondence. The identification of these drugs is\ngreatly facilitated by a pharmaceutical glossary written by Moses\nMaimonides. When the sage of Cérdoba moved from the west of the\nMediterranean to the east, he, like many other physicians of the\nIslamic world who were great travelers, became strongly aware of the\nfact that the same drugs had different names, often three or four, in\ndifferent parts of the world and sometimes even in the same place.\nMaimonides’ glossary was edited with an excellent commentary (in\n\nGoitein, S.

Thus, as\na rule, they would certainly not feel themselves obliged to provide\nfor the poor of the Muslims or to ransom their captives.\n\nOn the other hand, the minority groups lived in closest proximity\nto the majority and were bound up with it by the same economy and\nby being subjects of the same government. They shared similar bur-\ndens and were exposed to a similar fate. This made the situation\ncomplicated and markedly different from the mutual relationships of\nthe members of modern nations. The Muslim, Christian, and Jewish\ncommunities each formed a nation, umma, in itself, but in every\ncountry they shared a homeland, watan, in common. Both concepts\nwere of highest practical and emotional significance, as the Geniza\nletters show. While it was natural, however, to be treated differently\nas a member of another religion, it was revolting to be discriminated\nagainst as a permanent resident ol the same country.\n\nThis dichotomy in the relationship of a medieval minority group\ntoward the surrounding majority is beautifully expressed in this pas-\nsage from a letter of the Jewish judge of Barqa (eastern Libya),\nwritten in Alexandria. He had intended to make the pilgrimage to\nthe Holy City, but, as usual, the ways in Palestine were unsafe, the\nwinter was cold, and our judge was clearly homesick. Traveling\nconditions could not have been too bad at that time, for the addressee,\nwho lived in Old Cairo, was indeed setting out for Jerusalem. In\nview of this, the writer felt somehow apologetic, explaining at length\n(in a letter sent a short time before the one containing the passage\ntranslated below) why his return to Barqa was urgently needed. Be-\nfore leaving Alexandria for the West he wrote again. After extending\ngreetings to various dignitaries in Jerusalem whom the addressee\nwas supposed to meet and settling some business matters (for the\njudge, as was usual with pilgrims, had also done some trading on his\nway), he continues: “On this very day a big caravan is setting out for\nBarqa under the command of Ibn Shibl. I have booked in it for my-\nself and for my goods at the price of 8 dinars, and have already paid\nthe fare. Most of the travelers are Bargis. They have promised me to\nbe considerate with regard to the watering places and the keeping of\nthe Sabbath and similar matters. For in the whole caravan there is\nnot a single Jew besides myself. Notwithstanding, I confide in God\nthat everything will work out fine according to his will.” Besides\ndemonstrating his confidence in God it was clearly the fact that he\ntraveled in the company of compatriots who gave the lonely Jew the\nfecling that he was safe.l\n\nGoitein, S.

Let us\nimagine the letters we wrote during or shortly after World War 11\nscrutinized by a historian nine hundred years hence. Will they give\nan adequate idea, let alone a detailed picture, of the atrocities com-\nmitted during that period? Still, since the restrictions and cases of\npersecution known to us from literary sources are well illustrated by\nthe Geniza, while on the other hand, it is rich in details about close\ncooperation between the various religious groups, its testimony should\nbe accepted in general as a true mirror of the real situation. In other\nwords, despite the limitations pointed out, the Geniza documents\nform a rich source of information on interfaith relations and cognate\nphenomena.\n\nThere is no need to recapitulate the legal and actual position of the\nnon-Muslims in the countries of Islam or of the Jews in medieval\nFurope, known to us from books on law and historical accounts.\nThese subjects have been treated in competent and easily accessible\nworks.? Only where the Geniza records significantly confirm or qualify\nthe results of previous research are their contents presented here.\n\n“He is a Christian and I am a Jew—he is not my companion,\nsahibi.” With this argument, repeated twice in the same letter, a\nTunisian, writing from an Egyptian town, wishes to make it clear\nthat he was not responsible for the misbehavior of his Christian busi-\nness friend. “The Bible bas said: never trust gentiles,” writes a Jewish\nmerchant from Aden, South Arabia, after some bad experience with\na Muslim. The saying is not found in the Bible, although Psalm 144:8\n“Whose mouth speaks lies and whose handshake is falsehood” was\nunderstood in this sense in the Middle Ages. But that maxim must\nhave been quite common, for I heard it as late as 1949, while visiting\nthe South Arabian port.3\n\nIt would be definitely wrong to see in such utterances any spe-\ncifically Jewish exclusiveness. Exactly the same maxim is used by\nMuslims with regard to Jews (“Do not trust a Jew, even forty years\nalter his conversion to Islam”).# As soon as Muhammad’s prophetic\nmessage became an institutionalized denomination, he began to en-\njoin the Muslims not to have Christians and Jews as friends and to\navoid their company. Similar injunctions, or even decrees to the same\neffect, were issued by the highest Christian authorities.

For as soon as\npeople of different allegiance mix closely, they discover that the in-\nvisible republic of decent men stretches beyond the barriers of reli-\ngion, party, and race, a discovery incompatible with the claim of\nabsolute superiority of one particular group. The astonishing fact\nabout the Geniza is that quotations like the two given are so rare. As\na matter of fact, thus far I have not come across any others of the\nsame type, and nowhere else are Christians or Muslims as a group\ncursed or even spoken of detractively. This, however, should not in-\nduce us to assume that the spirit of aloofness and superiority was\nabsent or even weak in that period. All we are allowed to conclude\nfrom the testimony of the Geniza is that it was not as high pitched\nand morbidly fanatical as in the later Middle Ages.\n\nGroup consciousness made itself felt in many direct and indirect\nways. Spiritual life centered entirely on religion (in contrast with\nscientific studies, which were interdenominational, but confined to\nlimited circles). Economic and legal transactions were made as far as\npossible within the religious group. Many business letters and legal\ndocuments reflect this situation. Whenever a commodity was ordered\nfrom overseas or out of town with no business friend available for\nsupervising its transport, the letter would state whether it should be\ncarried by Jews only, or by trustworthy gentiles as well. “I am not\nquiet when I send it with a Muslim; perhaps I shall find a Jew,”\nwrites a man from Minyat Zifta, apologizing that he had not yet\ndispatched a piece of fabric, woven by one of the women of his house-\nhold and promised to a relative in the capital. “I made four copies of\nthis letter, in order to give them to coreligionists traveling in different\nboats, but the third copy I gave to the proprietor of the Ibn al-\nQaddar, for no Jew traveled in that ship.” Thus we read in a letter\nfrom Alexandria, addressed to Ibn ‘Awkal in Fustat. But a merchant\nnewly installed in the capital of Egypt asks his correspondent in\nAlexandria to give his address to everyone “Jew or Muslim.” The\nabsence of “Christians” here means only that they were not active in\nthe branches cultivated by the writer.®\n\nAny power of attorney (and there is no type of documents, except\nmarriage contracts, so common in the Geniza as this) indicates\nwhether the attorney is allowed to approach a non-Jewish court in ad-\ndition or in lieu of the Jewish. Hopes and good wishes, as well as\napprehensions, are normally concerned with the religious commu-\nnity. A remark like the following: “May God spare Israel [ie., the\nJews] from the plague ravaging in your parts,” made in a letter dated\n1217, should not be taken as typical, for in such a context our letters\n\nGoitein, S.

Similarly, in the\nAnnals of the Orthodox Coptic church “God’s people” would not\nrefer to all those who believe in God, or even to all Christians, but\nquite specifically to the Copts of Monophysitic persuasion.®\n\nIntermarriage of course was proscribed by both the Church and\nthe Synagogue, while Islam permitted a Muslim to marry a Christian\nwoman or a Jewess. No such occurrence, however, is reported or re-\nferred to in our documents. The second Fatimid caliph of Egypt,\nal-‘Aziz (975-996), had, among others, a Christian wife, but in such\ncases the female partner normally accepted the religion of the hus-\nband. Because of his dietary laws, a Muslim would not partake of a\nmeal in a Christian family, nor a Jew anywhere outside his com-\nmunity. One should also bear in mind that in a Christian or Jewish\nhouse even a casual visitor would be offered a glass of wine, while at\nleast the Muslim middle class would shun such an open display of\ndisregard for the prohibitions of their religion.\n\nIn view of this far-reaching segregation it is not astonishing that\nthe Geniza letters contain practically no reference to the spiritual\nlife of non-Jewish communities. A simple man visiting Tyre, Leba-\nnon, at the time of its occupation by the Crusaders, adds in Hebrew\nto his letter written in Arabic: “The Christians here pray in open\nplaces.” In contrast with Old Cairo, which was full of churches, but\nwhere the Christian service had to be held behind closed doors, the\npublic ceremonies of the Crusaders aroused the astonishment of the\nvisitor from the Egyptian capital, just as their splendor, displayed in\nthe same town, impressed a famous Muslim traveler a few years later.?\nThe Geniza letters contain many references to the Muslim feasts and\nmonth of fast, but only with regard to their impact on economic life.\nHindu business friends are mentioned with much warmth and are\ncalled “brothers,” but nowhere do we find any remark about Hindu\nreligion, whose complete difference from everything known to them\ncould not have escaped those merchants from Mediterranean coun-\ntries. Only at the end of the Middle Ages, when Islam invaded Juda-\nism in the form of Islamic mysticism, which exercised a deep influence\non the weakened and decimated Jewish community, is the reaction\nto this movement echoed by the Geniza just as the opposition to it is\nfound in Judeo-Arabic literature.10\n\nUnlike Europe, where the Jews formed a single and exceedingly\n\nGoitein, S.

It is sin’iith, “hatred,” a Jew-baiter being called\nsoné, “a hater.”4 It should be noted that the phenomenon is nowhere\nreferred to as general; it is mentioned throughout in connection with\ncertain groups, towns, or persons. Oddly enough, the only religious\ngroup described as “haters” are the Isma'ilis, a sect usually believed\nto have been sophisticated with regard to differences in religion.

A writer discussing this\nmatter emphasizes that “the people of Alexandria” are not like those\nof Cairo. If they were allowed to lay their hands on Jewish property,\nnothing would remain of it.2! In the same period a Jewish scholar\ntraveling to Alexandria stops over for a week in al-Fuwwa (the termi-\nnal of the waterway connecting that city with the Nile), asking his\nbrother in the capital to secure for him a letter of recommendation\nto the Muslim chief judge of Alexandria, “for you know only too\nwell the anti-Semitism of the population of that city.”?*\n\nAn occurrence characteristic of this situation is vividly described\nin a Geniza letter. A Jewish notable bearing the title “the elder (or\nhead) of the congregations,” namely, of the Palestinian and Baby-\nlonian congregations of Alexandria, was falsely accused of having\nhad an affair with a girl of dubious reputation in a caravanserai.\nWhen the girl denied it, the accusers, members of the secret police,\nurged her to tell the qadi that the Jew had taken her by force and\nthen paid her; otherwise she would be led on a donkey through the\ncity and then burned.

Even the honor of the women was\nnot safe from the impudence of those oppressors.26 This statement—\nthe like of which has been found thus far in the Geniza only with\nreference to Alexandria—is paratleled by a contemporary poem which\ncomplained that Christian officials ruled over the bodies of Muslim\nwomen.?? But while the latter insinuation was perhaps false and in-\ntended only to inflame the masses against those officials, the former\nstatement gives the impression of being based on facts. For a similar\ncomplaint is found in an important, but incompletely preserved\nmemorandum, submitted by the Alexandrian community to the\nNagid Mevorikh b. Saadya. At that time, it seems, the Muslim popu-\nlation, too, suffered by the lawlessness rampant in the city.28\n\nThe criminal doings of the Alexandrian poll tax collectors were\nfinally stopped, as we learn from another report about sin’iith in that\ncity, referring briefly to reforms in the poll tax administration, but\ndescribing at length new troubles in the city.

An Alexandrian\nnotable writing to a friend complains about a common Christian ac-\nquaintance who intrigued against him and who caused him harm\nyear after year: “As if I personally had killed Jesus, for otherwise\nthere is no reason for him to nourish that enmity against me.”32\n\nIt is natural that in court intrigues the contesting parties should\nsometimes be arrayed along denominational lines. The Geniza has\npreserved a lengthy and highly interesting Hebrew letter of a govern-\nment official to the Jewish community in Constantinople describing\nhis own falling into disgrace and the rise of a Christian director of\nrevenue. After the death of the Nagid Mevorakh (in March, 1112)\nthe influential position of that official became a menace to Egyptian\nJewry, and four Jewish notables tried to bring about his downfall by\nmaking him suspect of connections with the Franks. Jacob Mann\ntakes this letter as an indication of the Christian and Jewish com-\nmunities “waging bitter war against each other.”38\n\nThis generalization is not warranted by our sources. Even the worst\nof all the Coptic administrators, a finance minister known as “The\nMonk” (executed in 1129), whose exactions are depicted in some\nGeniza documents as a great catastrophe, can by no means be regarded\nas an exponent of Christian prejudice against Jews. The Muslims\nand his own community, at that, suffered equally from his rapacious\nrule; and, besides, newly identified Geniza fragments show that he\nhad two Jewish associates who helped him to plunder their core-\nligionists.3 We have met with a similar type of cooperation, this time\na beneficial one, when the vizier Ibn Killis, a Jewish convert to Islam,\nadministered the newly founded Fatimid empire of the East with the\nhelp of a Christian finance director in charge of Egypt and a Jew in\ncharge of Syria.3% In short, single occurrences of interfaith strife\nshould never be taken as indicative of a general state of continuous\ntension, as long as such an assumption is not supported by sufficient\nevidence.\n\nThe position of the Jews (and Christians) in Jerusalem, about\nwhich we have many Geniza letters, some still unpublished, is also to\nbe regarded as a special case. In the first place, with regard to the ter-\nrible visitation of Bedouin rule during the twenties of the eleventh\ncentury, it is expressly stated that the Muslims were suffering similar\nprivations.

The\nrepeated reference to the prohibition of the use by the Jews of the\nShiloah spring south of Jerusalem as a ritual bath should by no means\nbe compared with similar restrictions inspired by twentieth-century\nracism. When the Jews returned to Jerusalem after the Arab conquest\nthey settled in the southern part of the city, partly because of the\npropinquity of that spring. With the growth of the city and the in-\ncreasing use of the spring for drinking purposes, however, the ancient\nprivilege was withdrawn.3¢\n\nThe prohibition of ritual slaughter, imposed occasionally on the\nJews of Jerusalem, Old Cairo, and Acre (the latter during its occupa-\ntion by the Crusaders) is also to be regarded partly as a withdrawal\nof a privilege rather than an act of discrimination. Ritual slaughter\nentailed either the maintenance of special slaughterhouses (as in Old\nCairo) or the reserving of a separate section in the bazaar where the\nanimals were killed (as in Jerusalem). One can understand that the\nmarket police were not always willing to grant this special privilege.\nMoreover, even the Muslims, who themselves observe a form of ritual\nslaughter, sometimes resented the strictness with which the Jews re-\nfused to eat any but “kosher” meat, but continued to sell them what\nthey regarded as prohibited. In the very oldest collection of questions\naddressed to a Muslim religious scholar, the following query is sub-\nmitted to him: a Muslim family employing a Jewish wet nurse has\nthe animals consumed in the house killed by a Jewish ritual slaugh-\nterer in order to enable her to partake of the common meals. Is this\ncorrect? Answer: X. (a well-known Muslim authority) has said: I\nprefer to perform myself the religious slaughter needed for my house-\nhold.37\n\nIt has often been said that it was incorrect to speak about “anti-\nSemitism” in the Islamic world, since the Arabs, the originators of\nIslam, were Semites themselves.

        "text": "vii, A, 1 “Anti-Semitism” 283\n\nthe history of the term. The word “Semitic” was coined by a German\nscholar at the end of the eighteenth century for purely linguistic pur-\nposes, namely to designate a group of cognate languages, such as\nHebrew, Arabic, and Ethiopic. To assume that the peoples belonging\nto this linguistic group are of one racial stock is tantamount to the\nassertion that an educated Afro-American, who speaks exactly the\nsame English as his white classmate, shares with him the same racial\norigin. In the wake of the blood and race romanticism of the nine-\nteenth century, the idea of a Semitic race was invented and cultivated\nin particular in order to emphasize the inalterable otherness and\nalien character of the Jews living in Europe. Hence the term “anti-\nSemitism.” We have used it here solely for convenience’ sake, in order\nto differentiate animosity against Jews from the discrimination prac-\nticed by Islam against non-Muslims in general. Our scrutiny of the\nGeniza material has proved the existence of “anti-Semitism” in the\ntime and the area considered here, but it appears to have been local\nand sporadic, rather than general and endemic.\n\nIt is not difficult to explain this phenomenon. To be sure, the Jews\nof the Geniza period did not form or belong to any specific social,\neconomic, or occupational group, but, owing to the strict observation\nof the Sabbath and the dietary laws, they were distinguished mark-\nedly and constantly from their environment. On the other hand, both\nin number and in power they fell far behind the numerous and partly\nvery affluent Christian denominations. Therefore it is not surprising\nthat the Jewish communities should have served occasionally as the\ntargets of exploitation and even of assaults. For human nature, a mix-\nture of pugnacity and cowardice, is always prone to attack where the\nrisks involved seem negligible. In particular in times of general tribu-\nlation a small minority is in danger of becoming the scapegoat of a\ndesperate population. When flourishing Tunisia was laid waste by\nthe Bedouin hordes occupying it in the fifties of the eleventh cen-\ntury, the Jews, on top of being visited by the same catastrophe as\ntheir fellow countrymen, were, in one city, menaced by the latter\nwith extermination, the pretext for this threat not being stated.38 In\na time of famine in Egynt, a letter reports from a provincial town\nthat the Jewish houses were plundered every Saturday and its inhabi-\ntants threatened as being in possession of hidden stores of foodstuff,\nwhile, in reality, they suffered the same or more terrible privations as\nthe rest of the population.® Such references, however, are excep-\ntional. As a rule, Christians and Jews suffered alike under the dis-\ncriminations imposed on them by Islam. In the case of the great\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In the decades\nfollowing the al-Hikim disturbances, the restoration of old syna-\ngogues and the building of a new one (in a town where its predecessor\nhad been converted into a mosque) are referred to without assuming\nopposition on the side of the government.** When in the eleven nine-\nties a new synagogue had to be built in Hebron, Palestine, because\nthe old one was in a ruinous state, the Muslim judge declared that\nal-Malik al-Afdal, the actual ruler of the Fatimid empire (to which\nsouthern Palestine then belonged) would never allow such a viola-\ntion of Muslim law. The problem was solved by the synagogue being\nbuilt on a plot bought from the judge, while the latter was satisfied\nwith the explanation that it was not actually a synagogue, but a\nhome #1\n\nIn face of this legal situation one wonders what the Christians and\nJews did when their congregations increased considerably owing to\nthe influx of coreligionists or otherwise. The purchase, in 882, of the\nChurch of St. Michael in Fustat by the Jewish newcomers from Irag\nand its conversion into the synagogue of the Iraqians is a case in\npoint. About this occurrence we know solely from literary sources.\nThe Geniza documents, besides the cases of rebuilding of synagogues\njust mentioned, report only the renting of modest buildings for their\nuse as assembly lalls. One example, a rather curious one, may be\nsummarized here: a building belonging to the government was leased\nto the Jewish community to serve them as a house of worship. The\nletter reporting this fact adds that as long as the director of finance\nof the town was a Muslim, the rent was low, for that pious man, as is\nexpressly stated, did not want to be exacting with regard to a place\nof prayer. When the Muslim died and was succeeded by a Jew, the\nrent was immediately doubled. The writer, with all deference toward\nthat overzealous official, who certainly was an important personage\nin the town, asks the addressee to intervene: the poor were in greater\nnecd of that money than the government.42\n\nWorship of the non-Muslim denominations under Islam had to be\ninconspicuous and was required to be confined to the church and\nsynagogue buildings.

It was secured every year by heavy payments “to the\nrulers of the city and its young men.”43\n\nThe Christians enjoyed similar privileges, especially in the good\nolden times, the tenth and the eleventh centuries. One must bear in\nmind that some of the Cliristian holidays were essentially revivals of\nancient Near Eastern popular festivities, and often the whole Muslim\npopulation, including the courts of the caliphs and governors, par-\nticipated in full—despite the protests of their religious scholars. In\nFustat, in particular, it was the night of Epiphany which was famous\nall over the Muslim world for its entertainments, like carnivals in\ncertain places today. We know much about these popular feasts from\nMuslim sources, but no reference has been found thus far in the\nGeniza, although, for instance, the Christian feast of the visit to the\nprison of Joseph in Gizeh, the suburb of Cairo, could as easily have\nbeen shared by Jews as it was by Muslims.44\n\nThere was one type of religious ceremony which neither Christians\nnor Jews could avoid displaying in public: accompanying the dead\nto their last rest. Funeral processions formed the target for molesta-\ntions and attacks by the mob and restrictions on the side of the\nauthorities. Around 1123, a Fatimid vizier decreed that Jewish (and\npresumably also Christian) funerals should be held only during\nnighttime, shortly before daybreak. Since we have from the same\nperiod a charter given to the Christians of Iraq that their ways of in-\nterring their dead would be respected (dated 1138), we may assume\nthat this malady of molesting the burials of non-Muslims was ram-\npant. It is attested by the Geniza also for Jerusalem and Ramle, then\nthe capital of Palestine. The wording of the Iragian charter might\nhave been intended to grant protection from still another insult di-\nrected against the dead of the non-Muslims: the destruction of, or\nthe prohibition to erect, tombstones and memorial monuments. The\nFatimid vizier just alluded to tried to implement both. He was, how-\never, too short a time in office for doing lasting harm and there are so\nmany references in the Geniza to sumptuous and resounding burials\n(wailing women and so forth), as well as to the erection of tomb-\nstones, that the restrictions and humiliations should be regarded as\nintermittent rather than permanent.*5\n\nThe most conspicuous aspect of discrimination against non-\n\nGoitein, S.

They were forced to wear a badge of a certain color,\na particular type of belt or of headgear, and, in general, to be content\nwith modest clothing as befitting a subject population. Countless\nreferences to this imposition are found in Arabic literary sources.\nThe Geniza proves, however, that during the Fatimid and early\nAyyubid periods practice must have differed widely from theory.\nPerhaps no subject is referred to in it so frequently as clothing, but\nnowhere do we meet in these periods any allusion to a specific Jewish\nattire. On the contrary, there is much indirect evidence that there\nwas none. A Jewish girl who had an affair with a Christian doctor\nwas regarded by her fellow Jews as being Muslim, which could not\nhave been possible if her clothing marked her as a Jewess. Nor can\nwe assume that the young lady disguised herself purposely, for such\nan important detail could not have been omitted in a legal docu-\nment, in particular as her accusers were Muslims.46 A young Jew, a\nnewcomer to Alexandria, was employed there in a Muslim workshop,\nuntil it was discovered that he was a Jew (presumably because he was\nunable to explain his continued absence from work on Sabbaths),\nwhereupon he was dismissed. Here again it is impossible to suppose\nthat he had exchanged his particularly Jewish attire for Muslim\nclothing; in the first place, he would have mentioned such a ruse to\nhis elder brother to whom his letter was directed. Second, he would\ncertainly not have escaped punishment, after his real identity was\nestablished.4” In an Arabic source we read that the Jewish physician\nof the Tunisian Sultan Mu‘izz (1016-1062) wore no distinctive mark\nand was taken by a Muslim judge and courtier for a Muslim.4® Even\nmore telling than these details, significant as they are, is the custom\nof describing bearers of letters or carriers of goods as Muslims or\nChristians, as the case might be. If anyone was immediately recogniz-\nable by his clothing, it is difficult to see why such designations were\nnecessary.4?\n\nThe bizarre edict on the attire of Christians and Jews promulgated\nby the caliph al-Hakim in a spasmodic fit of religious zeal (or political\nexpediency) proves only that no such discrimination had been cus-\ntomary before.®® Nor can that edict have been in force for a long\ntime, since it has left no traces in the Geniza, unlike the caliph’s ac-\ntion against the synagogues, which is referred to in numerous docu-\nments. Likewise, in 1121, when the Seljuk sultan of Baghdad needed\nsome cash, he had the grand idea of renewing the laws about the dis-\ntinctive dress of the nonbelievers, embellished by some special harass-\nments. The Muslim historians, as usual, report the event laconically:\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The Jalat [i.e., the Ra’s\nal-Jalat, the head of the Jewish Diaspora] was brought into the im-\nperial presence. He guaranteed the above-mentioned sums and col-\nlected them.”5! Since the Christian population of Baghdad was at\nleast as important as the Jewish, one misses here the catholicus, or\nhead of the Nestorian church (who also represented the other Chris-\ntian denominations). But Muslim historians never tried to be exact\nwhen dealing with non-Muslims. Another historian, writing about a\nsimilar decree issued in Baghdad thirty years earlier, makes mention\nonly of the Christians.52\n\nThe harassments of 1121 are described fully in two Geniza sources.\nOne, the autobiography of the Norman proselyte Johannes-Obadiah,\ngives the following details about the molestations in Baghdad:\n\n[The vizier] decreed that they should wear two yellow badges, one on the\nheadgear and one on the neck. Furthermore each Jew should have hanging\non his neck a piece of lead weighing one dirhem [3.125 grams approximate-\nly], on which the word dhimmi [“non-Muslim’] was engraved. He also should\nwear a belt around his waist, On the women two distinctive signs were im-\nposed. They should wear one red and one black shoe and have a small brass\nbell on their necks or shoes in order to distinguish them from Muslim\nwomen. The vizier appointed brutal Muslim men to supervise the Jewish\nmales and brutal Muslim women to watch over the females and to harm them\nwith curses and humiliations. The Muslims were mocking the Jews, and the\nmob and their youngsters were beating them up in all the streets of\nBaghdad.\n\nAfter having been softened up in this way, the non-Muslims were of\ncourse prepared to pay the exorbitant sums demanded from them.®\n\nAnother Geniza document, a report about a messianic movement\namong the Jews of Baghdad originating in the fall of 1120, mentions\nthat the ladies in particular resented the grotesque and humiliating\nordinance with regard to the distinctive attire to be worn by them\nand that the upper-class people were also forced to adopt it.5 It\nshould be noted that the same technique of extorting money was ap-\nplied against the Muslim population. in 1121, we learn, the merchants\nwere ordered to pay henceforth one-third of their net profit to the\nSultan. There was much lamentation over this crushing tax. After\nsome time it was abolished on condition that the merchants pay the\nSultan five thousand dinars as a sign of gratitude for his magnani-\nmity,5®\n\nGoitein, S. D.

These attempts, however, recorded by the\nArabic historians, were ephemeral and are not echoed in the Geniza\npapers. Only at the very end of the Ayyubid period, we read the fol-\nlowing passage in a letter from Old Cairo: “On that day, a herald of\nthe Sultan cried out in the morning and in the evening that the\nproperty and life of any Jew or Christian walking in the streets at day\nor nighttime without a distinctive mark or belt are forfeited.” The\nmuch-mutilated continuation of the passage seems to say that a similar\nproclamation had been made a week before and that it was caused\nby a scholar, perhaps a Muslim scholar, addressing—whom, is not\npreserved. The casual way in which this matter is reported after many\nother details mentioned in the letter seems to indicate that in this\nlate period the wearing of distinctive marks by non-Muslims was al-\nready generally accepted and the stern warning was addressed only\nto a few transgressors, presumably of the upper class.5¢\n\nNext to the specific attire it was the poll tax incumbent on Chris-\ntians and Jews which emphasized their inferior position. More than\nanything else it was the poll tax that brought the non-Muslim man\non the street into unpleasant contact with the executive organs of\nthe Muslim government; therefore it is treated below in the subsec-\ntion devoted to it. There the often-repeated prohibition to employ\nChristians and Jews in government service is discussed, a law that in\nthe Fatimid and early Ayyubid periods was honored in the breach\nrather than by implementation. The Geniza likewise contains no al-\nlusion to the poisonous propaganda against the treatment of Muslim\npatients by Christian and Jewish physicians. On the contrary, as we\nhave seen, the Geniza frequently mentions Jewish physicians as\nserving Muslim rulers or working in Muslim hospitals. It cannot have\nbeen different with the lower classes, as is proved by the large num-\nber of Jewish physicians in provincial towns, where they could not\nhave found a livelihood, if they had to rely exclusively, or even\nmainly, on the small Jewish communities.

The forced restriction of the Jews in Europe to a few base or\nhateful occupations left on them a stigma, not entirely eradicated\neven today. There was no such a thing under Islam, Economic dis-\ncrimination against non-Muslims was exercised in ancient Islam,\nwhen, in imitation of a Byzantine law, they had to pay a double rate\nof customs duties. This was a heavy imposition, since in those days\ncustom duties were paid not only at frontiers of countries, but at the\nentrance to any major city. This law, however, was certainly no\nlonger applied in Fatimid times. It was revived by Saladin and must\nthen have been enforced for some time, for several references to it\nfrom the Ayyubid period are found in the Geniza. Thus, a young\ndoctor is advised not to travel from Egypt to Syria, “for, as a Jew,\nyou will have to pay thitty silver pieces as customs duties.” Another\nletter, from a provincial town, states that it was impossible to travel\nat that time to Old or to New Cairo because of the customs. The\nGeniza al:o shows, however, that Saladin himself repealed that de-\ncree, which thus had no lasting detrimental elfect on the economic\nor social position of the non-Muslims.58\n\nIn conclusion we may say that the position of the Christians and\nJews under Islam during the period and within the area considered\nhere was both safeguarded and precarious. Islamic law protected\ntheir life, property, and frecdom and, with certain restrictions,\ngranted th~m al<o the right to exercise their religion. On the other\nhand, it demanded from them segregation and subservience, condi-\ntions that under a weak or wicked government could and did lead to\nsituations bordering on lawlessness and even to outright persecutions.\nDuring the eleventh, twelfth, and early thirteenth centuries, the\nsound rrincinles of Islamic law were more conspicuous than its dark\nsides, at least in Fgvpt.

Thus far, only three\ninstances have been noted in our documents: for Qayrawin, the\ncapital of the country known today as Tunisia (middle of eleventh\ncentury), for al-Mahalla al-Kubra, an important town in the Nile\nDelta (in a document dated 1202) and for Mosul in present-day\nIraq.! The Jewish “Place” in Mosul is called in a letter dated May\n16, 1287, by the same designation that is already used in the oldest\nreport about the conquest of that city by the Arabs six hundred years\nearlier.2 That letter, however, which describes the devastations\nwrought by an earthquake, specifies almost exclusively houses outside\nthe “Place,” and it seems that at least two out of the nine houses re-\nferred to belonged to Muslims,\n\nWe have no deeds for Mosul. Therefore we cannot say whether\nMuslims or Christians lived in the Jewish “Place” there. In the very\ndocument, however, from which we learn about the existence of a\nJewish quarter in al-Mahalla, Egypt, the property situated in it is\ndescribed as bordering on the house of a Christian. Conversely, an-\nother document from the same town, dated 1144, deals with a Jewish\nhouse in a neighborhood different from the Jewish quarter.? As for\nQayrawan, two of three Jewish properties whose description has been\npreserved bordered on Muslim houses.* Thus we see that references\nto Jewish quarters are by no means indicative of anything compar-\nable with a ghetto.\n\nOur main material comes of course from Old Cairo. There was no\nJewish quarter in that city, but the bukk of the Jewish population\nwas concentrated in a few neighborhoods, sitvated within, and bor-\ndering on, the old Roman fortress that formed the nucleus of Muslim\nFustat. Jewish houses were also found in other parts of the city, in-\ncluding some fashionable ones, and one deed deals with a mansion\nthat had once belonged to the famous vizier Ibn Killis. As far as our\ndocuments indicate boundaries, we sce that even in the Jewish neigh-\nborhoods, at least half the houses had gentile neighbors. Without\ndoing any special research in this matter, I have noted eight cases of\nJewish living quarters bordering on Christian property, seven on Mus-\nlim, and five both on Christian and Muslim properties. The prepon-\nderance of Christians is to be explained by the fact that Christians\nand Jews had lived in the Roman fortified city before the advent of\nIslam and remained concentrated in their old quarters in order to\nenjoy the propinquity of their ancient and highly revered houses of\n\nGoitein, S.

A case from Alexandria, 1132: a Jew rented a house from\na Christian, which bordered on both Christian and Jewish proper-\nties.®\n\nThe closeness of Jewish and gentile living quarters is well illus-\ntrated in this passage from a letter of a scholar complaining to a\nprominent notable how he was snubbed by the latter’s son-in-law.\n“When I came to his house he shut the door to my face; I stood at the\ngate like a dog . . . [Proverbs 26:11], and, while his gentile neigh-\nbors were looking on, 1 stood there and stood, knocking the ring,\nwith him hearing me, but paying no attention.” ¢\n\nThe Lane of the Jews in Old Cairo represented only a very small\nfraction of the Jewish settlement in that city. It began near the an-\ncient gateway of the Roman fortress, from beneath the Mu‘allaga\nchurch (still in existence) and ran along the synagogues of the Baby-\nlonians and the Palestinians. Most probably it received its name\nwhen the church St. Michael, which was later converted into the\nsynagogue of the Babylonians, was acquired, together with other\nChristian property, by the Jews, who thus expanded into a prepon-\nderantly Christian neighborhood. It is significant that thus far only\ntwo deeds making mention of this lane have been found.”\n\nSimilarly, we would be entirely mistaken if we assumed that the\nLittle Market of the Jews, mentioned by Muslim historians describ-\ning Old Cairo, was the main scene of Jewish economic activities in\nthe city. As a matter of fact, it does not appear in any Geniza docu-\nment and was probably called thus by Muslims because of a Jewish\nslaughterhouse situated on it. The Jews, like their fellow citizens of\nother religions, were active in many bazaars, markets, and squares,\neach called after a specific commodity or craft and referred to in\ndozens of Geniza documents. In Palestine the situation was different.\nThe Market of the Jews in Tiberias (which had been the capital of\nJewish Palestine in the early Middle Ages) is given as address in a\nletter and mentioned in a document from September, 1034, which\ncontains the important detail that the property that formed the ob-\nject of the contract was situated “on its western colonnade.” The\nMarket of the Jews in Ramle is repeatedly referred to. These markets\nwere a source of income for the Jewish authorities, both from the\nritual slaughtering that was done there and the payments received\nfrom the proprietors of the stores.

In five cases noted thus far\nin the Geniza the pariners were Christians, in three others, Muslims.\nThe dates of the documents referred to as far as preserved range\nfrom 1148 to 1234, One document, an incomplete deed in Arabic\nscript, in which a Christian sells his share to his Jewish partner be-\nfore a Muslim court, and another in which three Christian ladies do\nthe same, originated in the eleventh century at latest. With regard\nto Jerusalem, too, we read about a house or compound, in which\nsome rooms belonged to a Muslim and others to a Jew (around 1040).\nIn Minyat Zifta a house was held in partnership by “the son of the\nRav” and a qadi, while the properties surrounding it were partly\nJewish and partly Muslim.? .\n\nIn houses in which, as it often happened, the various apartments\nwere not entirely separated from one another, for instance, when all\nparties had to use the same well, it was difficult for Jews to live to-\ngether with Muslims. For Muslim custom secludes the female mem-\nbers of the family in a separate section, a custom never accepted by\nthe Jews. Since living quarters shared in common thus caused so much\ninconvenience to Jewish women, added to which was apprehension\nof Muslim overbearing and the possible desecration of the Sabbath,\nthe Jewish authorities promulgated a statute forbidding the sale or\nrent of parts of houses to Muslims. Private persons, too, tried to pro-\ntect their womenfolk from such inconvenience. When a notable had\ngiven a house as a gift to two brothers on condition that a certain\nwoman should be permitted to live there, he stipulated a fine of 50\ndinars on the recipients if they sold the house to a Muslim during\nher lifetime (April, 1156). A woman who had donated part of a\nhouse to the poor and a small house adjacent to it to her housekeeper\nstipulated that the small house should never be sold to Muslims, since\nthis would be a nuisance for the poor (Feb.-March, 1117). Such re-\nstrictions naturally had an adverse effect on the price of Jewish prop-\nerty. A query addressed to Maimonides alleges that it reduced the\nprice to one-third of the real value. Maimonides insists repeatedly on\nthe strict observance of the statute, even in case of property belonging\nto orphans, permitting an exception solely in years of famine.1°\n\nAnother responsum by Maimonides is illustrative of the situation.\nMinor orphans lived together with their mother in a house owned in\n\nGoitein, S.

The latter converted to Islam—a change\nthat made the sharing of the premises precarious—and, in general,\nthe neighborhood became dangerous (as the relevant letter states).\nMaimonides rules that the part of the house belonging to the orphans\nmay be sold, although such property normally was not touched until\nthe orphans came of age and were able to dispose of it themselves.1t\n\nEconomic considerations, however, were stronger than those that\nprompted the issue of the statute mentioned above. Queries similar\nto those submitted to Maimonides were sent to his son, the Nagid\nAbraham. In a letter addressed to the latter’s grandson and namesake\nwe read that in a provincial town, most probably al-Mahalla, it was\nforbidden under the penalty of excommunication to sell houses situ-\nated in the Jewish quarter to a Muslim, but the prohibition was not\nobserved. Even more telling is the fact that the charitable founda-\ntions belonging to the Jewish community found themselves forced\nfrom time to time to rent rooms and apartments to Muslims and\nChristians. Many such cases are registered in official documents dated\n1058 through 1234, Non-Jewish tenants were so common that in an\naccount from spring, 1218, a Christian acted as collector of the rents.\nWhen, however, a house opposite the women’s entrance to the Iragi\nsynagogue was once rented to a Muslim, a strong protest was\nlaunched.1?\n\nOn the Islamic side, no restrictions with regard to the freedom of\nchoosing their domicile were imposed in our period on non-Muslims.\nThis is attested both by literary sources and the Geniza papers. It\nwas only the fanatical sect of the Almoravids of Morocco which cre-\nated a ghetto, while a similar decree ascribed to the Fatimid caliph\nal-Hakim with regard to New Cairo was either invented by a later\nscholar, or, in any case, was ephemeral. The visitors in our day to the\nhorrible mellahs, or Jewish quarters, of Morocco, are reminded that\nthese places are characteristic of the later Middle Ages and not of\nthe period described by us, which, for western North Africa, how-\never, had come to an end one hundred and twenty years earlier than\nin the Muslim Fast.13\n\nInterfaith cooperation in economic matters was even closer than\nthe propinquity of the living quarters of the various religious com-\nmunities. There is of course no need to adduce examples for Jews\ndoing business with Muslims and Christians, both local and foreign.\nNor is it necessary to emphasize that among their customers were\nMuslim religious scholars, for in both religions judges and other\nprofessionals frequently were active in business and, conversely, busi-\nness men often were learned.

As is well known, the biogra-\nphers of the Prophet Muhammad tell us that one of his secretaries\nlearned the Hebrew alphabet in order to be able to read the letters\nof the Jews addressed to his master and to answer them in the same\nscript. When, as the Geniza shows, Jews would write to their Muslim\nacquaintances in Hebrew in the eleventh century, when Arabic script\nwas as widely diffused as the Latin, there is no wonder, that such\nthings happened in the seventh, when Arabic script was hardly de-\nveloped.\n\nIt is significant that we find commercial partnerships between\nJews, Christians, and Muslims, and again even with qadis. Some Mus-\nlim law schools prohibited such connections or attached certain\nstrings on them. In the eleventh century, from which most of the\nbusiness papers preserved in the Geniza come, no such restrictions\nare discernible. We find straight partnerships mentioned in them, as\nwhen a Tunisian merchant sojourning in Sicily writes in or around\n1064: “All my dealings in olive oil [they amounted to the enormous\nsum of five thousand dinars] are made not on my personal account,\nbut in partnership with Muslims and Jews [in this order], inhabitants\nof Palermo.” In the same letter he refers two more times to his Mus-\nlim partners.’s The archive of Nahray b. Nissim teaches us that such\npartnerships constituted a joint undertaking lasting for years and\nwere not merely an ephemeral relationship.26\n\nThe most common form of partnership was the commenda, in\nwhich one party supplied the capital or the goods and the other did\nthe actual business. Many such connections were formed between\nMuslims and Jews, sometimes the former and sometimes the latter\nproviding the capital. According to some Islamic law schools one of\nthese two business connections or both are undesirable or prohibited.\nBut the Geniza provides examples for each during the eleventh\nthrough the thirteenth centuries, and a query addressed to a Muslim\nscholar of the fourteenth century (answered of course in the negative\nwith regard to both relationships) proves that even in those late and\nbigoted times such cooperation between the followers of different\nreligions must not have been uncommon. In a letter written in or\naround 1141 the writer mentions a commenda worth 30 dinars re-\nceived from a Muslim judge in a provincial town, while one in the\namount of 100 dinars was given by a Jewish merchant of Old Cairo\nto a Muslim in Alexandria, made out, as is stated, before a Muslim\ncourt.

A Jewish scholar confides his goods to the warehouse\nand agency of “our master, the illustrious qadi Abu ‘}Tahir Ibn\nRaji’,” as the relevant document, issued in Fustat, 1097 by a rabbini-\ncal court, styles him. Tunisian Muslims had their consignments\nhandled in Egypt by a Jewish compatriot Nahray b. Nissim, travel-\ning to that country in 1046. Still earlier in the eleventh century we\nfind one Muhammad as the permanent representative in Alexandria\nof Ibn ‘Awkal, the prominent Jewish merchant and public figure.\nUnder these conditions it is not surprising to find a Jewish merchant\nbanker in close relation first with a Muslim and then, years later,\nwith his son.18\n\nOften our documents do not indicate whether the business connec-\ntion between Muslim or Christians and Jews was that of a simple\npartnership, a commenda, a power of attorney, or another arrange-\nment. This is true in particular of the many instances in which\ncommodities belonging to members of one religious community were\ntransported by those of another. A Jewish merchant who was mur-\ndered on his way from Egypt to Yemen had carried with him numer-\nous goods belonging to Muslims and others in Tunisia. Another Jew\ntransports copper entrusted to him by a Muslim from Qayrawan via\nAlexandria to Old Cairo. In one single letter a Jewish merchant,\nwriting from Qayrawin, mentions by name four Muslims traveling\nin a caravan to Egypt and carrying for him different consignments\nof clothing and purses of gold. In another Geniza letter the addressee\nis asked to hand over shipments destined for the writer to a certain\nMuslim and only if the latter could not be reached, to a Jew_called\nby name. Similarly, two scholarly Jewish merchants from Qayrawin,\nliving in Egypt, entrust their shipments to the slave (and business\nagent) of a Muslim judge of their native city. At a time when non-\nMuslims had to pay special customs duties, an India traveler on his\nway home is advised by his brother in Alexandria to dispatch all his\ngoods with Muslims in order to save the oppressive imposition.1®\n\nIn short, business in those days had to rely largely on personal con-\nfidence and was therefore concentrated within a family, a clan, a\nclose knit circle of friends, or a religious community far more than\nit is in our own times.

Such visits thus must have been a matter of rou-\ntine. It should be remarked, however, that both the sender of that\nletter and his Muslim acquaintance were Tunisians.3! In Palestine\nwe find a Gaon requesting an influential Jewish court physician to\nact on behalf of a Muslim official, who was harassed by a new gov-\nernor. The Gaon himself had been asked for this favor by a Muslim\nnotable with whom he was on good terms.3?\n\nParticularly noteworthy are the friendly relations between the re-\nligious scholars and dignitaries of the various denominations.\nThroughout the Geniza letters and in the queries addressed to Mai-\nmonides and his son Abraham and their answers the Muslim judges\nand jurisprudents are referred to in terms of reverence and rarely\nwithout a eulogy wishing them temporal or spiritual success or both.33\nNaturally, these niceties would be omitted when a case of taking\nbribes or accepting false witnesses was reported.

A (very fragmentary) letter of thanks praises a\nscholar who had passed a certain time, it seems, during the High\nHolidays, in a provincial town. His presence highly enhanced the\nprestige, jah, ol the Jewish community “and both Jews and Muslims\nwere happy with him.” 38 A description of a particularly festive read-\ning of the Esther scroll, in which over eight hundred adult males,\nboth Rabbanites and Karaites, took part, concludes by emphasizing\nthat Muslims, too, had been present. (Haman, the villain of the\nEsther story, is denounced as exceedingly wicked also in the holy\nbook of Islam).3 We have read above how “Jews and Muslims” were\nhappy about the escape of the writer from danger and congratulated\nhimn on that miraculous event.#?\n\nLooking back on the testimony of the Geniza documents with re-\ngard to interfaith relations we find that the religious concepts of\nsuperiority and seclusion—which should not be rated solely as nega-\ntive—were counteracted by economic and social conditions that made\nfor a more tolerant attitude. Therefore the picture obtained was not\nat all simple and uniform. Nor was this antagonism between the zeal\nfor one’s own religion and humane broadmindedness only a social\nphenomenon.

For in 1012, according to our sources the fifth year of the\nmeasures taken against the Christians, he was still praised in a He-\nbrew “Scroll” as a just ruler. Later, however, the Jews were affected\nas well. We read in a letter preserved in the Geniza about Jews who\nhad been forced to adopt Islam and others who preferred death or\nwho emigrated to Byzantium, Yemen, or other countries. That per-\nsecution, however, vehement as it was, lasted for only a short period,\nfor in documents dated 1016 we already see the rabbinical court of\n01d Cairo doing normal business, and in any case the forced converts\nwere allowed to return to their respective religions before the caliph’s\ndeath in 1121.1\n\nThe experience gained under al-Hakim probably guided the be-\nhavior of the Jews under the far more dangerous and long lasting\npersecution by the Muslim sect of the Almohads in North Africa and\nSpain.2 The victory of this bellicose denomination was accompanied\nby the wholesale slaughter of Christians, Jews, and dissenting Mus-\nlims. Very many Jews, given the choice between the sword and Islam,\nabandoned their religion, and, as a Geniza letter emphasizes, the\nleader of the community in Sijilnasa, the important caravan city in\nMorocco, was the first to do so. Most probably he regarded that ter-\nrible avalanche as a passing visitation, for which the sacrifice of so\nmany lives seemed unreasonable. If he indeed thought so, he was\nmistaken. The Almohads came to stay for many years, so that there\ndeveloped a phenomenon of Muslim crypto-Jews very much similar\nto that of the Marranos in Christian Spain of later centuries: their\nconversion to Islam did not protect them against ceaseless vexations\nand sometimes even outright destruction 3\n\nAside from these two persecutions, which have to be regarded as\nexceptional, no particular pressure to adopt Islam was exercised on\nthe minorities during the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods although\nthey were encouraged to do so. Nor were the disabilities to which\nthey were exposed so burdensome as to cause mass conversions. There\nis, however, some evidence in the Geniza that there were individual\ncases of persons from all ranks of the society who, for whatever rea-\nson, found it more convenient to join the ruling religion. The Geniza\nword for apostasy to Islam is pdsha’, literally, “to renounce one’s\nallegiance” (cf. I Kings 12:19), from which a Judeo-Arabic word\nafsha’ was formed. Neither the verb nor the nouns for “renegade”\nand “apostasy’’ derived from it are registered in this sense in any\nHebrew dictionary.t They occur regularly in our documents, though.\nA letter from Alexandria, written about 1060, reports the conversion\nto Islam of the cantor of the Jewish community of Palermo, the capi-\n\nGoitein, S.

A Maghrebi\nwho had suffered much from the impositions and false accusations of\nsome Jewish leaders in Alexandria confesses (around 1085) that he\nhad been on the verge of embracing Islam. He fasted eight days,\nthree even during the nights, in order to atone for such a sinful in-\ntention.® In litigations about inheritance, converts to Islam appear\nrepeatedly as contestants; one such document is dated 1157.6\n\nPersons living in a foreign country and thus anyhow uprooted\nfrom their habitual environment, were particularly exposed to the\nlure of the ruling religion. Maimonides, in one of his responsa, calls\nsuch occurrences commonplace, and in a query to his son, the Nagid\nAbraham, we have the strange case of a traveler giving his wile a\nprovisional bill of divorce to be effective in case he adopted Islam\nwhile abroad.” An occurrence of a somewhat different character illu-\nstrates this situation. A Jew, but not his wife, had embraced Islam.\n(A Muslim, we remember, is permitted to be married to a Jewess or\nChristian). After a year, when he was about to go abroad, she de-\nmanded a divorce, but he refused, arguing that he intended to be\naway for only a short period. When ten years had passed, and he had\nnever written home from India, where he stayed, his wife applied for\na divorce. She wanted to marry another man, for the times were hard\nand she was unable to support herself. The query, written in Arabic\ncharacters, was addressed to a Muslim jurisconsult, but, since she\nwas Jewish, the latter turned the case over to a Jewish court, as may\nbe concluded from the Hebrew writings on the reverse side of the\ndocument, which prove that it had found its way back into Jewish\nhands.® In general, it is understandable that a person changing his\nreligion would prefer to move to another town or country, and sev-\neral such instances can be traced in the Geniza.?\n\nOn the other hand, we do find renegades maintaining close rela-\ntions with their former coreligionists. In the case of high dignitaries,\nwhere conversion was a matter mostly of expediency, it is perhaps not\nastonishing, as evident from the life story of the Fatimid vizier Ibn\nKillis10 A similar situation, however, prevailed in the lower classes\nas well. We have read about a Jewish silk-weaver employing a Jewish\nconvert to Islam. “A red-haired renegade” is referred to in a letter\nas conveying a message from a relative. We hear even about a couple\nof converts who wanted to have their son circumcised in the Jewish\nway.1t\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Isaac proceeded to\nBaghdad, where he studied under “The Unique.” A poem of his,\ndedicated to his master’s philosophical commentary on the book of\nEcclesiastes (Kohelet), completed in 1143, is extant. Isaac returned\nlater to the Jewish faith, claiming in his poems that his conversion\nto Islam had been a fake. From the same poems it appears, however,\nthat it had not been made under duress, or in the ardors of a love\naffair (as a learned student of medieval Hebrew poetry is inclined to\nread there between the lines). Since apostasy from Islam was punish-\nable by death (see below), Isaac had to travel for his second change of\nreligion to a Christian country, but he soon fell ill. His father, who\nin those years roamed about France, England, and Italy, rushed to\nhis sickbed, but was unable to save him.1?\n\nThe Geniza has preserved a letter sent from Egypt in 1139 by the\nIndia trader Halfon b. Nethanel to Isaac Ibn Ezra while the latter\nwas still in Spain. Although Isaac was then a very young man, twenty-\nfive years old at most, Halfon addresses him in a way that betrays\nboth intimacy and esteem.!®8 Two letters written by Isaac himself\nshow him to be a rather strange person. The letters are partly in\ncryptic language, and in one passage he uses Coptic numerals in order\nto express Hebrew characters denoting Arabic words. Not enough\nwith this, he employs also a secret code. The Spanish youth and the\nseasoned India traveler did some business together, but shared to an\neven larger extent common literary interests.1®\n\nSamuel the Maghrebi became a militant Muslim, and his book\nagainst his former coreligionists served as a man source for later\nanti-Jewish Muslim polemics. But Abu ‘l-Barakat “The Unique”\nadopted Islam only very late in life and possibly under duress (differ-\nent versions are given for his decision: wounded pride, death of the\nmother of a sultan whom he had treated, fear of death when cap-\ntured in a battle); his daughters remained Jewish. Since the Gaon\nSamuel b. Eli of Baghdad quotes him in his polemic with Maimon-\nides, Abu 'I-Barakat's apostasy seemingly was not taken very seriously\nby his former coreligionists.20\n\n‘With the catastrophic worsening of the legal and actual position of\nnon-Muslims in the late Middle Ages, mass conversion to Islam be-\ncame an epidemic.?\n\nAs for the opposite phenomenon, the adoption of the Jewish reli-\ngion by Muslims, the legal situation has first to be considered.

As is natural, those non-Muslims who persuaded\nor aided him exposed themselves to the same punishment. Such an\noccurrence is vividly described in two Geniza letters written by one\nAbi Nasr on May 11, 1141, in Alexandria. They refer to the Spanish\nHebrew poet Judah ha-Levi who was then on his way to the Holy\nLand. In Alexandria there lived at that time a convert to Islam called\nIbn-Basri (family name derived from Basra in southern Iraq), whose\nbrother in Spain had handed over to Judah ha-Levi’s fellow traveler\nan order of payment for him in the amount of thirty gold pieces.\nWhether on the request of Ibn al-Basri’s Spanish brother, or out of\nhis own initiative, the poet tried to persuade the renegade to travel\nwith him to Palestine, then in Christian hands, where he could\nreturn to Judaism without incurring danger. The renegade, how-\never, denounced ha-Levi, who had to appear successively before the\nhead of the secret police, the governor, and the qadi of the city.\nHad he not been well known and highly respected from a prior and\nprolonged visit to Alexandria—the writer of the letters remarks—his\nlife would have been forfeited. As it was, the anger of the mob be-\ncame directed against Ibn al-Basti for giving so much trouble to a\ndistinguished visitor, and he was almost killed.?3\n\nDespite the enormous danger involved, there were sporadic cases\nof Muslims attracted by Judaism, and, as two letters of Maimonides\naddressed to such converts show, they were educated persons deeply\ninterested in religious questions. We learn also that the converts had\nto leave their country, otherwise they would have exposed them-\nselves to certain death. In another letter, Maimonides rules that\nreligious propaganda (he uses the phrase “to draw people to our\nreligion”) should be made amongst Christians, not among Muslims.\nHis reasons, however, were theological, not practical: Since the Chris-\ntians accepted the text of the Old Testament as the unadulterated\nword of God, it was possible to argue with them about its interpreta-\ntion; there was no such means of understanding with the Muslims,\nsince they took the distortions found in their Koran as genuine reve-\nlation.2*\n\nMaimonides’ favorable attitude toward proselytizing is echoed in\nthe Geniza documents, in which converts to Judaism are mentioned\nfar more frequently than Jews adopting Islam. Most of the converts\nto Judaism were Christians, in particular from Ram, that is, Byzan-\ntium and western Europe. Foreign proselytes removed to the coun-\ntries of Islam for reasons of safety are referred to in a number of\ninstances. A report from Alexandria, written around 1200, mentions\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Elhanan, the leader of the\nEgyptian Jews around 1000. The bearer of the letter was a Christian\nfrom a noble family who, after his conversion to Judaism, had fled\nto Damascus and from there to Jerusalem. In both cities, as the\nwriter, a Spanish Jew, emphasizes, the convert was exposed to insults\nand threats on the part of the local Christians, who were backed by\ntheir powerful coreligionists in government service. The Spanish Jew\nhad met the proselyte both in Damascus and Jerusalem and now asks\nShemarya to take care of him after his arrival in Old Cairo. It is\nnoteworthy that Egypt was regarded to be a safer place for a Chris-\ntian convert to Judaism than Syria or Palestine.43\n\nA similar case is reported in a letter written over two hundred\nyears later. The muqaddam of Bilbays, that important caravan sta-\ntion on the routc from Palestine to Cairo, informs his superior, the\njudge Elijah b. Zechariah in Fustat, that a scholar called Ibn al-\nMagqdisi (“the man from Jerusalem”) had arrived from Gaza and\nthat he wished to detain him in Bilbays for two months in order to\nstudy with him a talmudic treatise dealing with marriage laws (two\nmonths were thus regarded by the muqaddam as sufficient for that\ntask). The Palestinian scholar was accompanied by “Ibn Hallab\n(lit. son of the milker), the prosclyte.” The way in which the proselyte\nis referred to shows that some previous correspondence must have\nbeen conducted on his behalf between Jerusalem, Fustat, and Bil-\nbays, presumably in order to find out whether it was safe and expedi-\nent to remove him from Palestine to Egypt. His family name does not\nnecessarily imply that he was of low extraction.4\n\nThe most impressive Geniza document on proselytism is the He-\nbrew “autobiography” of the Norman cleric Johannes-Obadiah, in\nwhich he describes the circumstances under which he embraced\nJudaism, the dangers to which he was exposed in his country after\nhis conversion, as well as his extended travels among the Jewish com-\nmunities under Islam and the messianic movements that he encoun-\ntered there. His apostasy was no doubt due to a certain crisis in the\nchurch of southern Italy, where the Norman nobleman was born and\n\nGoitein, S. D.

He describes\nhis conversion as the consequence of a dream he had in his youth\nwhen he was still in his father's house. He saw himself officiating in\nthe church when he was addressed by a man standing at the altar,\nwho recited the following verse from the book of Joel: “The sun\nshall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the\ngreat and terrible day of the Lord will come” (2:31 in the Authorized\nVersion; 3:4 in the Hebrew text). Johannes-Obadiah, writing in He-\nbrew at least twenty years after this event, still quotes the words of\nthis verse in Latin (written in Hebrew charactersl), as he had heard\nthem at that decisive hour, so mighty was the impression made on\nhim by their very sound. They are indeed the key to the understand-\ning of the whole problem of conversion to Judaism. It was the feel-\ning, so common in the Middle Ages, that the end of the physical\nworld was near and the Day of Judgment at hand which set people\nthinking. This sentiment caused some seekers of God to adopt Juda-\nism, the original and therefore regarded by them as the true form of\nmonotheism.\n\nThus the conversion to Judaism of Johannes-Obadiah was essen-\ntially an inner-Christian affair. The same is to be said of the cleric\nwhose Hebrew letters have been referred to above. He reports that\n“after having circumcised himself” and beginning to observe “the\nholidays of God, as they are written in the Torah,” as well as the\nSabbaths, he wrote fourteen pamphlets 46 in which he assembled all\n“the questions and arguments” that had induced him to change his\nreligion. He submitted his book to his archbishop with the request\nto refute him. In his naive belief he adds that if the church dignitary\nlad only taken the trouble to read the book, he and his fellow clerics\nwould certainly have been convinced and would have followed the\nwriter’s example. In order to fortify this claim he enclosed six of the\nfourteen pamphlets (presumably translated from Latin or Greek inte\nHebrew). God, however, had ordained not to enlighten the heart of\nthe church dignitary. Our writer was put into prison and threatened\nwith execution or banishment to an island where he would die, if he\ndid not repent. Fortunately, one of the prison guards had a nightly\napparition that induced him to provide for the prisoner's escape, let-\nting him down from a window with a rope.4?\n\nAstonishingly, the Geniza has preserved a similar case of conversion\nto Judaism without interference from an Egyptian village.

She did as\nadvised, and here is her application, as far as extant:\n\n. .. Your illustrious Excellency. . . . I do not desecrate any holiday or\nSabbath. . . .

I should not be surprised at all, if for\ninstance, the six pamphlets attached to the letter of the disputation-\nhungry cleric, analyzed above,?® were to turn up one day amidst a\npackage of unidentified theological texts. Moreover, the question of\nchange of religion cannot be separated from the more general prob-\nlem of the ever-changing religious situation in each community.

COMMUNAL JURISDICTION\n1. The Judiciary\n\nNothing is so characteristic of the position of the non-Muslim\nminorities under classical Islam as their judicial organization. On\nthe one hand, their judiciary derived its authority and executive\npower to a notable degree from the Muslim government; criminal\njurisdiction, and in particular, capital punishment were, as a rule,\nprerogatives of the state; and any member of the minority groups\nwas free to apply to a Muslim judge instead of to the courts of his\nown denomination. Yet, the wide range of cases brought before the\nrabbinical courts (as proved by the evidence of the Geniza), as well\nas the marked divergence of the Jewish judiciary, law, and procedures\nfrom the Muslim ones are illustrative of the high degree of autonomy\nand individual life enjoyed by the minorities in the period under\nstudy.\n\nIn the first place, it was the wide range of legal matters connected\ndirectly with religion, such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and the\nstatus of slavery and freedom, which was the natural domain of the\ndenominational courts. In addition, there were many good reasons\nthat would induce a Jew or a Christian to seek justice within his own\ncommunity. Religious law encompassed the gamut of economic and\nsocial life. Therefore the pious, who preferred to be judged according\nto his religion rather than another law, had no need to apply to the\ncourt of the state.

The members of the Jewish courts were,\nas a rule, personally known to the parties either from the synagogue\nor otherwise, and, in any case were regarded by them as people of\ntheir own kind. Finally, since the Jewish court was composed of\nthree or more members, litigants themselves frequently had experi-\nence of the bench, which naturally made them more inclined to\nentrust their cause to an authority and a procedure with which they\nwere familiar.\n\nFinally, the express injunctions of his religion and the pressure of\nhis social group were apt to force a Christian or a Jew to apply to the\ndenominational rather than to the Muslim court. Every reader of\nthe New Testament is familiar with these fulminating words of the\napostle Paul addressed to the Corinthians (I, 6:1-4): “When one of\nyou has a grievance against a brother, does he dare go to law before\nthe unrighteous instead of the saints? Do you not know that the saints\nwill judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you\nincompetent to try trivial cases? If then you have such cases, why do\nyou lay them before those who are least esteemed by the Church?”\nThis attitude (which reveals Paul’s background as a former Jewish\ndivine) remained basic in the Church and in the Synagogue through-\nout the ages. It is echoed in many Geniza documents, as shown in the\nconcluding section of this chapter.\n\nThe Muslim and Jewish judiciaries differed widely as to their\norigin and nature. The Muslim qadi was originally the delegate of\nthe caliph or the provincial governor, and, like the latter and the\ncaliph himself, never shared his authority with anyone else. He was\nfree to consult the doctors of law or experts in any other matter, but\nthe decision rested with him alone.! His duties and prerogatives\nwere not only judicial, but largely administrative. The estates of\norphans and other property entrusted to the courts were in his hands.\nHe often combined with his office highly lucrative positions of\npower, such as that of the controller of the revenue of a district or\nthat of the superintendent of a port (see sec. G, 1, ¢, below).\n\nJewish law was based on the assumption that “none may judge\nalone save One,” namely God: at least three men should be con-\nvened as a court, in order to avoid errors and miscarriage of justice.\nIn talmudic times, and perhaps under the influence of later Roman\njudicial organization, where the delegate of the provincial governor\nhad a position similar to that held subsequently by the qadi in Islam,\n\nGoitein, S.

Maimonides in-\ncorporates this principle in his Code of Law and, as we see from\nhundreds and hundreds of Geniza documents, it was adhered to\nthroughout in practice.\n\nIn the extremely rare cases in which we find a record signed by\nonly one dayyan, it is a draft, as indicated by the word “greetings”\nattached to it (namely, greetings to the scribe who was to make out\na proper copy).?\n\nAs a rule, the court records found in the Geniza bear three and\nvery often more than three signatures and, as the names known to us\nor the form of the signatures show, wherever feasible, persons with\nlearning were co-opted as associate judges.

Both principles, specifically, to have as many\njudges on the bench as possible and, whenever available, to choose\nlearned persons for the purpose, are also laid down in Maimonides’\nCode.*\n\nIn most records it is not indicated who acted as the president of\nthe court, nor are we in a position to know this, for even in a pro-\nvincial town two or more legal experts were often active at one and\nthe same time. Particularly instructive in this respect is a dossier of\neleven sessions of the rabbinical court of Old Cairo held in the course\nof 1097-1098, and dealing with one case of litigation where the same\njudges appear again and again, but sign in different sequences.5 In\nthe gaonic period of the Geniza, that is, the major part of the eleventh\ncentury, it seems to have been customary for some presidents of the\ncourts to sign last.® This tallies with the fact that in the records pre-\nserved from the courts of the Gaons themselves, the highest juridical\nauthority, the signatures of the latter appear regularly at the end.\nIn reply to a query referring to this matter, the Gaon Solomon b.\nJudah says expressly: “According to the ceremonial of the Palestinian\nyeshiva those who sign first are the lowest in rank, those who sign last\nare the highest.” 7\n\nTechnically speaking, the court records, as a rule, are not judg-\nments, but “testimonies” to depositions by one or more parties or\nwitnesses, or to agreements made by, or forced upon, the parties.\nSince, according to Jewish law, two persons were sufficient as wit-\n\nGoitein, S.

This was the case also in the society\nrepresented in the Geniza records. The professional judge was called\ndayyan. His course of study and many-sided tasks as mugqaddam, or\nexecutive head, of a local community, as well as his emoluments, are\nstudied in other parts of this book. It now remains for us to define\nwith more precision his role in the administration of justice.10\n\nFirst, a vexatious point of terminology has to be cleared up. Many\nrecords open with the phrase: “We, the court, and those [or: the\nelders and the like] who sign with us.” In a document dated Decem-\nber 18, 1027, the reference is no doubt to a court composed of three\nscholars, mentioned by name, and assisted by the elders.!1 In most\ncases, however, the term “court” (Heb. béth din, “house of justice™)\ndoes not refer to a judicial assembly of three or more persons, but\ndesignates a professional judge confirmed or appointed by an ecu-\nmenical or territorial authority and presiding over a court. Often the\nappointing authority would be mentioned in the introductory sen-\ntence of a record. In the capital of Egypt there were three such judges,\ntwo in Old Cairo (one for each of the two Rabbanite congregations)\nand one in New Cairo. The former often sat together, the latter (be-\ncause of the distance) joined them only in particularly important\ncases. The word ““court,” as in English, could thus designate a single\njudge, so the word was used also in the plural in order to refer to\ntwo or more professional judges forming one court. “My lords, the\ncourts” was a deferential form of addressing the two chief judges of\nthe Jewish community of Old Cairo.1?\n\nWith the exception of Old Cairo and Ramle, the administrative\ncapital and commercial center of Palestine, any city had only one\nofficially recognized Jewish judge.!® Thus we would read in the Gen-\niza letters about “the” judge of Sijilmasa, Morocco, of Barqa, Libya,\n\nGoitein, S.

But\nonly the chief justice was styled “the court,” whereas he would refer\nto the others as “my colleagues, the judges,” dayyanim.}® Similarly, in\na provincial capital, such as Damietta, there would be one person of\ndistinction addressed by his superior, the Gaon of Jerusalem, as\n“court,” two others as “judge,” and still two others referred to simply\nas “‘our master,” or “Mr.\" 18\n\nThe title “court” is an abbreviation of “president of the court,” or\nrather reflects the usage of calling the head of an institution by its\nname. Thus, Arabic mathiba does not only mean yeshiva, but also\n“Gaon, head of a yeshiva”; Aramaic b¢ rabbanan, “house of higher\nlearning” designates also its head. In Arabic documents a similar\ncustom can be observed, but the Jewish usage might be pre-Islamic.1?\n\nThe main prerogative of an officially appointed judge was the\nright to interpret the law authoritatively. This does not imply that\nhis rulings were irrevocable. Even a decision of a Gaon or Nagid\ncould be contested by another scholar. As a rule, however, the com-\nmunity over which he had jurisdiction was bound to accept his inter-\npretation of the law and its application to any given case. Likewise,\nonce approached by a party, the opponents could not demand to be\njudged by another court, while, in principle, the choice of a court\nwas a matter of agreement. In short, “the appointed judge has in his\ndistrict the same authority as the high court of the yeshiva has over\nall Israel.” 18\n\nAnother irritating aspect of judicial terminology in the Geniza\nrecords is the frequent occurrence of the biblical word for judge or\nleader, shofet, especially during the tenth and eleventh centuries.1?\nWhat was its relationship to the other terms just discussed, “court”\nand dayyin? It seems to me that the biblical word was revived to\nserve as Hebrew equivalent of Arabic hakim, the general term for a\nperson invested with juridical authority, whether religious or secular.\nThe talmudic title “dayyan” carried with it the connotation of a\nscholar versed in all aspects of rabbinical law and lore, including the\nritual and theology. Thus, it could not be applied to a person who,\nalthough not unfamiliar with Jewish learning, was mainly a com-\nmunity leader and judge in cases of civil and family law. Such a\nperson is clumsily described in an ancient document as “one who\noccupies himself with the affairs of the community and considers\ntheir cases of litigation.” 20 The biblical “shofét” was a conveniently\nshort title for such a person of authority, but, like Arabic “hakim,”\ndesignated also full-fledged professional judges holding official ap-\n\nGoitein, S.

The latter usage is attested for the tenth and the first\nhaif of the eleventh centuries with regard to Damascus, Ramle, Al-\nexandria, and Old Cairo, as well as Sijilmasa, Morocco. Consequently,\nthe biblical term designates also the Muslim qadi—sometimes in the\nmiddle of a document or letter written entirely in Arabic.2!\n\nA shoféer who was not a professional judge or a scholar, would be\nin charge of a community in a smaller town.22 We find, however, at\nleast three families of shaféts also in Old Cairo (shaféts, whose son,\nbrother, and grandson, respectively, held the same office) and a lane\nwas named after one of them.?® The widely dispersed Jews of Yemen\nwere led for a lengthy period by shoféts residing in San‘a, then, as\ntoday, the capital of the country.2* During the twelfth century the\ntitle fell into disuse. It was a time of growing religious consciousness,\nwhich was not favorable to the idea of a secular judge. As our docu-\nments show, laymen continued to sit on the rabbinical courts after\n1200, but we no longer hear about the office of shafét. To be sure, the\nArabic term “hakim” as a designation for Jewish judges, which ap-\npears in a document written as early as around 1010, is used regularly\nin the queries addressed to Maimonides (1204), as well as in his re-\nplies.2s\n\nMuslim influence is clearly evident in another term for judge,\nnd’ib, “deputy.” The Muslim qadi, as stated, was originally a dele-\ngate of the caliph or of the provincial governor. He had no authority\nby himself. Thus we have in Islam the curious situation of the qadi\nwho dispensed the heavenly revealed law, to which caliphs and gov-\nernors, like any other Muslim, owed absolute obedience, who in his\nturn had no independent position, but was subordinate to the state.\nThe term considered here seems not to have developed out of this\nrelationship, but rather reflects the concept that all judges in the\ncaliph’s empire were only delegates and representatives of the chief\njustice at the imperial court. During the heyday of the caliphate the\nletter of appointment, say, of the chief judge of Egypt (which was\nthen but a province of the Abbasid empire) would state that he was\ninstalled to represent his superior (who had his seat in Baghdad) in\nthe country of the Nile.\n\nThe Geniza records reveal that a similar situation prevailed in the\nJewish community. Originally, the local judges were appointed by,\nand were deputies of, the head of the yeshiva, the Gaon, or rather of\nthe president of its high court.

These judges, as their letters show,\nbrought doubtful cases to the knowledge of their superiors or asked\nthe latter to come and deal with them in person.2¢ The designation\n“deputy” was therefore quite appropriate. In a circular to ail the\nJewish congregations outside Cairo, the address has nuwwab, “depu-\nties,” while the text itself is directed to the “judges,” dayydnin.27 It\nshould be noted, that the term “deputy” makes its appearance in the\nGeniza only at the time of Mevorakh (ca. 1079-1112), in whom we\nhave seen the real founder of the office of Nagid, whereas for the\n“representative” of the Gaon, in the very rare cases when an Arabic\nword was used at all, the more religious term khalifa was applied.28\nThe local judges are referred to as deputies of the Nagid and not, as\na rule, of the chief judges in Old Cairo, and the latter themselves are\nsometimes styled thus.2® It stands to reason, therefore, that not only\nthe word, but also the very idea, namely the derivation of judical\npower from a semisecular authority, was taken over from the Islamic\nenvironment.\n\nAs with the Muslim word for judge, the Muslim term “deputy”\nwas translated into biblical Hebrew. As such, Hebrew mishne could\ndesignate the president of the high court of a yeshiva, who was but\na deputy of its head, the Gaon, or of any other judge, Jewish or even\nMuslim.30\n\nBesides nomenclature, the Jewish judge had little in common with\nhis Muslim colleague. In the period under study, the office of the\nqadi was a very lucrative one. It was customary to purchase the\noffice for high sums. Unlike medieval France, however, where similar\npractices prevailed, the judgeship was not acquired for life. After\nhaving paid for his office, the qadi could be dismissed after a few\nyears or even a few days of service. During the period of four hundred\nyears terminated by the end of the Fatimid caliphate (in 1171), the\naverage time of office of a qadi in the Egyptian capital was five years,\nand only sixteen out of eighty served until their deaths. The others\nwere discharged often under humiliating circumstances.?\n\nIn contradistinction, the documents signed by Jewish judges in the\ncapital of Egypt during the years 965-1265 show an amazing degree\nof continuity. The average time of a judge’s office seems to have been\ntwenty-five years, while the signatures of some appear for over forty\nyears (see App. D). We have to keep in mind that the preservation of\ndated Geniza records and the preservation of dates on records (they\nare often effaced or torn away) are entirely fortuitous, so that the\nactual time of tenure of a dayyin might have been considerably\nlonger than that indicated by the documents signed by him.

We find occasionally that a\ndayyan did not get along well with his flock and actually left his post;\nin Alexandria we have complaints about dayyans during three cen-\nturies (although no report about actual dismissals has been found\nthus far). These complaints are concerned mostly with the dayyan’s\nstrictness and overbearing manner, or, on the other hand, with his\nleniency toward the common people. Charges of bribery or other\nmisconduct are extremely rare. An Old Cairene court record from\nApril, 1085, reports that a divorced woman intruded into the house\nof her former husband, and, when brought to court, insulted the\njudges “shouting: ‘you have taken bribes and brought about that di-\nvorce; that house is my house’ and saying other highly improper\nthings.” More serious is an unfortunately much mutilated letter of\na Palestinian Gaon (early eleventh century), in which he deplores the\nmiscarriage of justice by his deputy in Ramle and concludes with the\nremark that the elders of Ramle had adoped and put in writing a\nresolution to the effect that the dignitary concerned would be entitled\nto act solely as an assistant judge on a court presided over by the\nGaon,??\n\nOne of those parasitic nasis, while serving as judge in Alexandria\nfor a short time, is accused in a letter of having taken bribes (from\nboth litigants) and of appropriating books and carpets belonging to\nthe synagogue. Although these details are reported in a rather matter-\nof-fact fashion, one should keep in mind that the writer was the\nphysician and communal leader Aba Zikri, son of the judge Elijah,\nwho suggests to his father to take the nasi’s place. Similarly, the ac-\ncusation that the Palestinian Gaon Solomon b. Judah “sold the\nproperties of the community” is found in the letter of a partisan of\nhis rival Nathan b. Abraham. In view of the mass of information\navailable from the Geniza for about three hundred years, the almost\ncomplete absence of complaints must be regarded as an eloquent\ntestimony of generally decent standards of behavior.33\n\nArabic sources present a somewhat different picture of the Muslim\njudiciary.

Nor\nare the Geniza documents silent on this point. Attention, however, is\ndrawn to a recently published Islamic history by the eminent French\nhistorian Claude Cahen, who warns us not to take these charges too\nseriously. According to him, the institution of the gadi was one of\ntlie most durable of Islamic civilization. The Geniza, too, is not de-\nvoid of laudatory remarks about qadis.3¢\n\nThe contrast between the Jewish and Islamic judiciaries should\nnot be ascribed to any substantial difference in the levels of morality\nof the two societies, but, rather, to the entirely different nature of\nthe two offices. The qadi held a position of power, and power tends\nto corrupt; the dayyan owed his authority to his scholarship and\nacumen, qualities the exercise of which is mostly harmless and bene-\nficial. The Muslim judge, as we have seen, was an autocrat who gave\nhis decisions alone, the Jewish judge was the member of a court of\nthree, a circumstance that naturally acted as a restraint on high-\nhanded practices.\n\nMoreover, as has been shown, during most of the classical Geniza\nperiod the administration of the estates of orphans and of other\nproperty committed to the courts was in the hands of laymen called\n“trustees of the court.” This, too, had a beneficial effect on the\npropriety of public administration. This otherwise healthy separa-\ntion of the judiciary from administration was, of course, no com-\nplete safeguard against irregularities. Thus, we read in a letter to\nthe Nagid Mevorakh that the social service officers of the congrega-\ntion of the Iraqians in Old Cairo had embezzled up to 200 dinars\nfrom the estates of the orphans and that the judge, a weak person,\nhad connived with them. This accusation, made in a personal letter,\nmight have been exaggerated or perhaps entirely unfounded. But,\nwhile discussing a case of inheritance brought before him, the Gaon\nSolomon b. Judah remarks that without having received any outside\ninformation, by mere scrutiny of the evidence, he had come to the\nconclusion that “those worthy trustees are not trustworthy at all”\n(with a pun on the Hebrew title of the office). No human institution,\nhowever perfect, can entirely eliminate human wickedness.3%\n\nA vigorous element of continuity was the frequency of cases in\nwhich judges were assisted and succeeded by their sons. Appendix D\nshows six such examples for the Egyptian capital, and three similar\ncases with regard to shoféts were noted above.

We find such oc-\ncurrences in (New) Cairo, Alexandria, al-Mahdiyya, which replaced\nQayrawin, as the capital of Tunisia, and in Gabes, an important\ntown in the same country. Similarly, in smaller localities, like Asca-\nlon, Palestine, Barqa, Libya, or in Egyptian provincial towns, we find\nfather, son, and even grandson each following the other as the local\ndayyan.3%\n\nIt should be noted that a similar phenomenon is to be observed in\nthe contemporary Muslim society. The student of Fatimid history is\nimmediately reminded of the dynasty of qadis founded by the great\nal-Nu‘mén, who had served four Fatimid caliphs in Tunisia in this\ncapacity, accompanying al-Mu'‘izz to Egypt, and whose two sons\nserved as chief justices in Egypt after him. Another illuminating case\nis that of the Bani Jami‘a, a dynasty of Shafi'l jurists, who were ac-\ntive as qadis in Jerusalem, Damascus, and Cairo, just as members of\nthe families of the Gaons and presidents of the courts of the Pales-\ntinian yeshiva presided over Jewish courts in those cities.3”\n\nOn the other hand, the Geniza proves that there was a continuous\nhealthy influx of fresh blood; at least half the more important Jewish\njudges in this period were not succeeded by their sons. For example,\nboth positive and negative evidence seems to show that none of the\nfive sons of Aaron 1bn al-“Ammani, the most prominent Jewish judge\nof Alexandria during the twelfth century, functioned as dayyan in\nthat city after their father’s death. His great-grandson is known from\nmany documents written or signed between 1207 and 1243. He was,\nhowever, a notary and puisne judge, not a “court.” Occasionally, a\ngrandson would succeed in obtaining his grandfather’s rank. The\nsystem of succession to the dignity of Gaon and the hereditary aspects\nof public office in general are discussed in chapter v, sections A, 1, and\nB, 2, respectively.’8\n\nThe office of notary was not developed much as a separate institu-\ntion in the Jewish society of those days, at least not to the degree\nfound in Islam. The wide knowledge not only of law, but also of\nlanguages (Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic) required for the job, as well\nas the necessity of bringing most of the cases before a court anyhow\nwere not favorable to the creation of a special profession. A good\nmany of the legal documents from Old Cairo, dated between 1005\nand 1135, as far as they were not made out by judges, were written by\nsix successive and partly contemporary court scribes who also served\nas assistant judges and most of whom were cantors.3® The records\n\nGoitein, S.

A note, dated September, 1278, con-\ntains the announcement of the death of a woman on the day it oc-\ncurred together with information about her legal heir. The note was\nwritten by “Bu 'l-Fadl, son of the Rabbanite al-Maskil (a Hebrew\ntitle normally borne by a judge) in absence of Ma‘ani.” I take this as\nmeaning that Ma'ani was the notary who usually made such an-\nnouncements and that during his absence a son of the judge did the\njob. A declaration in Arabic characters details the gift of a property\nmade to a Jewish woman. At the bottom we read: “Witnessed by ‘Ali\nb. Sa‘d Allah, the Jew,” accompanied by the flourish used in Hebrew\nand Arabic documents to set apart the signature of the scribe from\nthe text. In both Jewish and Islamic law one person never could be a\nsufficient formal witness, Thus the word “witnessed” appearing at the\nbottom of the declaration can mean only “confirmed by the notary.”\nIn Islam, the notary is called shdhid, witness, or ‘adl, “trustworthy\n(witness).”\"40\n\nAny transaction, including a marriage agreement, required only\ntwo witnesses.

The first, unfortunately incomplete, court record re-\nlates that a merchant from Palermo, Sicily, had complained to the\npolice that he had already waited a full month for a Jewish court to\ndeal with his case, whereupon the head of the police apprehended the\nJewish judge for a night. In the second, complete, document, a mer-\nchant from Spain was accused of having obtained from the caliphal\ncourt a rescript to the qa’id or commander (as the governor of the\ncapital was styled then) to see him righted. The defendant explained\nthat all he wanted was to be judged by a Jewish court, but that one of\nthe three members of the court who were to judge him (after having\nheard his case in a previous session), had excused himself with being\nbusy “and other reasons.” It was resolved that if the three judges\nmentioned would not take up the matter during the following two\nweeks, each party was free to apply to a government court.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is not surprising to find in a fragment\ncontaining court records persons appearing on one page as parties\nand on another as representatives of the court.

It should be also noted that Maimonides,\nwho lived for about forty years in the Egyptian capital (ca. 1165-1204),\nhas not left a single court record signed by him in the Geniza, while\nmany other writings of his, and in particular responsa, were among\nthe treasures of that ancient hoard of manuscripts.\n\nIn a number of Geniza documents Maimonides is called “the mas-\nter (rabban) of all Israel” and even more commonly “the great rav,”\nwhich, with Arabic nomenclature, could be properly rendered as\n“grand mufti.”¢8 The ancient title: “the court,” or “the judge for all\nIsrael,” did not fit him. He was a jurisconsult—about 460 of his\nresponsa have been preserved—combining with this capacity the of-\nfice of the “head of the Jews” during certain periods. The three\nscholars just mentioned, Nabhray, the Rav, and Maimonides, were all\n{rom the Muslim West, and it seems that there, as also in western\nEurope, the rabbinate trod paths different from those of the East.6\n\nMaimonides’ son Abraham, although following in his father’s foot-\nsteps, betrays signs of assimilation to the eastern tradition. He was a\nprolific writer of responsa, but, as the Geniza shows, also sat in court\nsettling even minor litigations and revising in his own hand records\ndrafted by his colleagues or adjuncts.” Similarly, Nissim, the son of\nNahray, although like his father referred to as rav, “master,” and not\nas judge, signed and even wrote court records.”™ Thus it seems that\nthe divorce of the office of the jurisconsult from that of the judge was\ncharacteristic of the Jewish communities west of Egypt, but was occa-\nsionally imported to that country, where, as a rule, the learned doctor\nof law was also expected to act as a judge. Was this differentiation\ndue to internal Jewish developments, or to the influence of the en-\nvironment, or to both. This question is better left to subsequent\nresearch.\n\nThe preceding survey has revealed that in the Jewish communities\nrepresented in the Geniza records, law was administered by a wide\nvariety of authorities. The survey is by no means complete. This\nmuch, however, is evident from it: in the face of such rich documenta-\ntion we are not permitted to make generalizations not warranted by\nour sources. Thus, Jacob Mann, the pioneer of historical Geniza re-\nsearch, ventured to maintain that the Egyptian Nagid had under him\na supreme court comparable with that of his predecessors, the Pales-\ntinian Gaons, and that the president of this court bore the title\ndayyan al-Yahiid, “the judge of the Jews.” As a scrutiny of his quota-\ntions (which could be augmented) shows, all refer to the same person,\n\nGoitein, S.

In any\ncase, we do not encounter such a title, let alone an office of the charac-\nter alleged, in any document during the whole of the Fatimid and\nAyyubid periods. As we have seen, each of the three congregations of\nthe Egyptian capital had its own chief justice appointed by the Nagid.\nThroughout the thirteenth century there were still several learned\nJewish judges in Old Cairo at a time, and Elijah b. Zechariah was\nnot the most prominent among them. It may be that by the four-\nteenth century, when Old Cairo had dwindled almost to insignifi-\ncance and the Egyptian Jewish community as a whole had shrunk\nvery much, the Nagid, when appearing before the government, was\naccompanied only by one judge, styled by the Muslim historians\ndayyin al-Yahiid. A late Geniza document in Arabic characters seems\nindeed to confirm such an assumption. But here, as in the case of the\noffice of the Nagid himself, we should be on our guard not to attribute\nto the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods what was in fact a far later devel-\nopment.

Even this time-honored formula\ncontains an element of customary law. Moreover, contracts of all\ndescriptions, including marriage contracts, often conclude with the\nstatement that they were as valid and sound as any such contracts\n“instituted by our sages and in use in the world.”? In some eleventh-\ncentury marriage contracts it is even stated that they are properly\nexecuted and binding both “according to the statutes of our sages\nand the laws [invariably the Greek loan word nomos is used] of the\nstate,” or “the gentiles.”3 These formulas are in the Aramaic language\nand certainly originated in pre-Islamic times.

This right applies\nin the first place to commerce, as when the Jewish courts dealt most\nfrequently with the “partnership according to the gentiles,” that is,\nthe Muslim brand of the commenda, or the “bills of exchange,”\ncalled suftaja. “It is true,” writes a Gaon in reply to a query, “that\nour sages have said that one should not send bills of exchange, but\nwe see that people actually use them; therefore, we admit them in\ncourt, since otherwise commerce would come to a standstill, and give\njudgment exactly in accordance with the law of the merchants.”s\n\nThe marriage contracts, as well as other settlements made with\nregard to family life, also betray an amazing latitude of provisions\nand variety of usages. The principle of rabbinical Jaw “any stipula-\ntion made with regard to financial matters is valid” supplied ample\npossibilities for satisfying the demands of the highly developed so-\nciety living on the shores of the Mediterranean basin during the\nperiod of the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries.®\n\nOn the other hand, as soon as the Law, that is, the strict religious\nlaw, called also “the preserve of God,” was administered, harsh or\nstrange decisions, to be expected in a legal system going back to re-\nmote antiquity, could not always be avoided. The Law applies in\nparticular to such institutions as the levirate marriage, as well as to\ncertain other aspects of family law and the law of inheritance which\nhad their origin in an intrinsically agricultural society. The sab-\nbatical year, that is, the provision that every seventh year all debts\nwere automatically annulled, unless protected by a specific deposition\nin court by the creditor, seems to have been revived in Egypt by\nMaimonides, for the relevant Geniza documents come mostly from\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century. In economic matters, the\nsituation was different. After the experts had given their opinions as\nto the legal position according to the religious law (and sometimes,\nas we shall see, divergent opinions), the parties knew what they could\nexpect from a judgment and tried to come to an agreement as favor-\nable as possible to each side. As a last means of pressure, one party\nwould threaten to apply to a Muslim court.

No doubt with an eye on the law of the cognate religion,\nMaimonides opens the Book of Acquisition in his Code of Law with\nthe following words: “Title to an object is not acquired by oral\nagreement alone, even if witnesses testify to that agreement.” Then\nhe goes on to explain in sixty-six, sometimes lengthy, paragraphs,\nthe various ways in which each type of movable and immovable ob-\nject may be acquired.” The reader of Maimonides’ Code who is not\nfamiliar with the practice of the courts, as manifested in the Geniza\nrecords, will conclude that Jewish, like ancient Roman, law, was a\npeasants’ law, utterly unfit for the exigencies of a highly mercantile\neconomy. The sixty-six paragraphs, however, become obsolete by\nparagraph five of chapter five of the Book of Acquisition, which\nreads:\n\nReal estate, slaves, cattle, and other movable [i.e., everything] may be\nacquired by symbolic barter, This act is called ginydn [lit,, purchase]. The\nfundamental principle of this mode of acquisition is that the transferee\nshould give the transferrer an article of however small a value and say to\nhim, “Acquire this article in exchange for the yard or the wine or the cattle\nor the slave that you sold me for as much and so much.” If this is done, then\nthe moment the vendor lifts the article and takes possession of it, the vendee\nacquires title to the land or the mentioned movables, though he has not\ndrawn them or paid their price, and neither party may retract.\n\nIn practice, a kerchief, or a similar small object was handed over\nby one party to the other and then immediately returned as a gift.\nFrom the Hebrew word ginyan, the Judeo-Arabic verbs gana, “to\nacquire a right,” and aqnd, “‘to confer a right,” found in most Geniza\ndeeds, are derived.\n\nIntangible rights, such as a power of attorney, were conveyed by a\nsymbolic act called “transfer adjunct” (namely, to the transfer of\nland) ginyan aggav. Different forms of this symbolic act are repre-\nsented in the Geniza records, from the old, but rare formula of “giv-\ning” the threshold of the entrance to one’s house, to the commonplace\nphrase of giving four square cubits of the soil of the Holy Land, in\nwhich each Jew was supposed to have a share. Such symbolic formulas\nshould not be mistaken as actual conveyances of land, as has been\ndone even by a competent student of the Geniza. Moreover, I am not\nso sure that the symbolic act itself was always performed.

A carpenter who\nlet his gentile employees work on Saturday was to be flogged accord-\ning to some scholars, while others wanted him to be fined and excom-\nmunicated as well.10 When a man declared in a public statement that\nhe was prepared to suffer the death penalty if it was proved that he\nhad cursed the head of the Jerusalem yeshiva, we are certainly not\nallowed to conclude that such punishment was ever inflicted by the\nJewish community on an offending member during the Geniza\nperiod.1? We read about a Jewish official, a cantor, in Alexandria re-\ntrieving a theft, but nothing is said about the punishment of the thief.\nWith one exception, no reference has been found thus far to the ap-\nprehension of a culprit by a Jewish authority.12\n\n1t is particularly noteworthy that sexual offenses are nowhere dealt\nwith in the court records of the Geniza. There is occasional talk\nabout persons suspected of having had illicit relations, but the ques-\ntion raised with regard to them is always whether they are allowed\nto marry each other (forbidden by Jewish law), not how they should\nbe punished. In one court record a Jewish girl is charged by two Mus-\nlims with being too intimate with a Christian physician. The docu-\nment is written, as usual, in Hebrew characters, but the signatures of\nthe three Jewish “witnesses” are in Arabic, suggesting perhaps that\nthe case was finally to be brought before a Muslim judge (to whom\nthe text of the accusation would be read out by his Jewish col-\nleague.)!3 Of a man with abnormal sexual behavior it is said in one\nletter that he should be expelled from the town (as was done with\nprostitutes). But no expulsion could be carried out without the as-\nsistance of a state authority.1*\n\nFines stipulated in contracts for the case of breach were extremely\ncommon. It is therefore strange that we hear next to nothing about\npayments imposed by a court as a punishment. We just noted the\ncase of the carpenter who was accused of having desecrated the Sab-\nbath and for whose punishment some scholars suggested, inter alia, a\nfine.

All in all, this important instrument of medieval law\ndeserves new scrutiny in the light of the Geniza, preferably in con-\njunction with the parallel institutions of the Coptic and other Orien-\ntal churches.32\n\nIn conclusion, the reader is reminded that law in’those days was\npersonal and not territorial.

As we shall pres-\nently see, the court procedure itself presupposed lively international\ntraffic.\n\n3. Procedures\n\nNaturally, procedures differed according to the character of a case\nand the authority before which it was brought. Yet some general\ntrends are clearly discernible throughout.\n\nThe court records preserved in the Geniza are of three main types.\nThe first is concerned with fact-finding, consisting of depositions\nmade by the parties, questions addressed to them by the presiding\njudge or the opposing party, or both, and the answers given to these\nquestions, as well as the evidence provided to substantiate the claims.!\nFormal judgments, quoting the legal sources and detailing the rea-\nsons for the decision made, are almost entirely lacking.? Instead, a\nlitigation is concluded (often, as stated, after long proceedings) by a\ndeclaration of one or both parties, fortified by the “symbolic pur-\nchase,” discussed above. Such a declaration is either an “acquittal,”\nin which the parties release each other from any further obligation,\nafter the conditions specified in the document have been, or will have\nbeen, fulfilled,® or an “acknowledgment,” in which one party declares\nto owe such and such a sum or another obligation to the other.\nNormally the terms of the payment or of the fulfillment of the obliga-\ntion are also specified.\n\nIt would be entirely wrong to assume that the courts acted merely\nas boards of arbitration, without having recourse to statutory law.\nMany hundreds of responsa, or legal opinions, have been preserved\nfrom this period which indicate that conflicts in economic life not less\nthan family matters, were decided according to rabbinical law,\nhandled by legal experts. How, then, is the almost total absence of\njudgments from the Geniza records to be explained?\n\nThere can be little doubt that this apparent deficiency was a mere\nmatter of form and procedure. Interpreting or applying the law of\nthe Torah in a wrong way was regarded as a very grave sin. “May\nGod preserve me [rom the sin of judgment,” that is, of handing down\na wrong judgment, was a phrase even used in the conclusion of a\nlegal opinion.® “A judge who does not render an absolutely true\njudgment causes the Divine Presence to depart from Israel. If he un-\nlawfully expropriates money from one and gives it to another, God\nwill exact his life from him.”¢ These and similar warnings of the\nancients, reproduced by Maimonides in his code, were taken literally\n\nGoitein, S.

Therefore, in order not to expose themselves to\nsuch jeopardy, the judges refrained altogether from giving formal\njudgments, a procedure expressly recommended by the Shulhan\nArukh, the authoritative Jewish book of laws (sixteenth century).?\nThe Geniza has preserved a tenth-century query concerning a judge\nwho accepted his appointment only on condition that he should\nnever be obliged “to give formal judgments in cases which he would\ndecide.”® The Muslim judges adopted a similar attitude.\n\nIn view of these religious scruples, the decisions of the courts were\ngiven the form of declarations of the parties. Rather than stating that\nthe court sentenced a person to make such and such a payment, the\nminutes would contain an “acknowledgment” by that person that he\nowed this sum to the other party. Instead of an acquittal by a court,\na party thus [reed from an obligation would receive a “release” from\nthe claimant. But the user of the Geniza records should not be misled\nby this legal formality. In the cases of real settlements outside the\ncourt our documents would state that “upright elders,” or “peace-\nloving persons” or simply “those present” intervened and brought\nabout an agreement through arbitration or persuasion. The count-\nless “releases” and acknowledgments that do not contain such re-\nmarks have to be regarded as results of judicial decisions.\n\nHow were these decisions reached? In our own time—and the same\nwas already the case in later Roman juridical practice—each party\nemploys an attorney who presents the facts and interprets the law so\nas to appear as favorably as possible to his client. Attorneys of this\ntype were next to unknown in the courts depicted by the Geniza. As\na rule litigants were represented by attorneys only when they were\nabsent or unable to attend a court meeting in person. Such attorneys,\nas a rule, were not professional lawyers, although of course, for this\ntask one preferred prominent and scholarly persons well versed in\nbusiness matters (and thereforc often known to us through other\nGeniza papers). Litigations between persons living in different locali-\nties were so common that powers of attorney constitute the type of\ndocument found most frequently in the Geniza. The appearance in\ncourt of a party together with an attorney was so exceptional, how-\never, that Maimonides was asked whether such a procedure was legal\naltogether. Maimonides answers in the affirmative, but gives the other\nparty the right to disqualify the attorney if he found him disconcert-\ning, and to demand to have dealings only with his adversary.® Thus\nfar, only one court record (dated Dec., 1027) has been found in which\nan adult male person appears together with his attorney and in which\nthe latter does the speaking.!® This was perhaps an exceptional case,\n\ng Vol. 2.\nGoitein, S.

The absence of this type of rhetoric, noted with\nregard to Muslim literature, is felt also in the Geniza records.?3 Still,\nmany court depositions rendered in our papers are impressive in\ntheir lucidity and force, and some, such as those (from the years 1038\nand 1041-1042) translated in Mediterranean People, are not devoid of\neloquence, perhaps a natural propensity of the Mediterranean at-\nmosphere,’* We have to keep in mind, of course, that according to\nboth Maimonides’ code and an express reference in a Geniza docu-\nment, the presiding judge would recapitulate the statements made\nby the parties, the recapitulation being taken down verbatim by a\nclerk or the beadle of the court. Thus the clear and concise wording\nof most of the court records preserved in the Geniza might reflect\nprofessional skill rather than natural gifts.18\n\nVery often the judges found that the litigants said things that had\nno actual bearing on the subject matter of the dispute. In such a case\nour records would contain the remark: ““Many statements were made\nwhich to report would lead far afield. The upshot of all that was the\nfollowing.”1¢ In smaller matters the presiding judge himself would\ntake notes and, as is human, sometimes failed to do so. The Geniza\nhas preserved a note by a judge to a colleague stating that he had\nforgotten the exact date and some of the conditions of a settlement\nmade before them; overleaf, the desired data are provided.1?\n\nAs to evidence, statements of witness were often submitted in writ-\ning. The handwriting of the witnesses on the original document had\nto be validated by a court (local or other) so that it could be used\neverywhere.

A party who\nbelieved that for a lawsuit over only one gold piece one witness was\nsufficient learned to his dismay that he was mistaken.20 In practice,\nfrequently five, six, and more witnesses signed a testimony. In such\ncases, only two signatures required attestation by a court, although\nin many documents all the signatures, sometimes seven at a time,\nwere validated as genuine. No fixed procedure seems to have pre-\nvailed in this matter.2!\n\nIn the extremely frequent cases where testimonies had not been\nvalidated by a court, each signature had to be attested by two wit-\nnesses. Owing to the lively traffic in the Mediterranean there was no\ndifficulty in finding in Old Cairo or Alexandria witnesses for the\nhandwriting of persons living in the West (see Med. Soc., 1, 69). The\nvery custom of letting as many persons as possible testify with regard\nto an occurrence or a legal transaction probably had its origin at least\npartly in the endeavor to make subsequent validation easier, since, as\nwe have seen, any two signatures to a testimony were sufficient for its\nvalidation.??\n\nDocuments were widely admitted as evidence. “This letter of mine\nis your proof in court” writes one eleventh-century merchant to an-\nother advising him to dispose of goods costing a large amount of\nmoney.?® This remark is echoed in a responsum by Hay Gaon of\nBaghdad, sent to the Jewish scholars of Gabes, Tunisia, in 1015,\nwhich states that the letters of the merchants in which they give in-\nstructions to their correspondents are to be accepted as evidence like\ndepositions in court.?* In actual court records we indeed see letters\nproduced and used as statements of parties.25 Account books of mer-\nchants were also admitted in court as proof, and were quoted as such\nin the records.2¢ Islamic law, too, although opposed in principle to\nthe acceptance of written testimony, softened its attitude in this mat-\nter through the centuries.??\n\nCircumstantial evidence, amdra, literally, “a sign,” is involved five\ntimes in a letter dealing with a case brought before the Maimonid\nNagid Joshua b.

The func-\ntion of the attorney was fulfilled to a certain extent by the legal\nopinions given in writing, the responsa of the experts. The normal\nprocedure of a legal case of some importance would thus be as follows:\n\nFirst the court would try to verify the facts and to define as exactly\nas possible the legal position. For this purpose, the judges would hear\nthe depositions and arguments of the parties, examine the witnesses,\nand study the documents submitted to them. In one case, the dossier\nof which has been preserved almost completely, this procedure re-\nquired nine sessions held in the course of ten months. Then the\nparties, and if he saw fit, also the presiding judge, would present the\ncase, as it had been formulated in court, to one or more legal experts.\nThe latter would not always answer. Thus we read in one letter that\nNahray b. Nissim, “the most illustrious member of the academy,”\nrefused to give his opinion in writing, most probably because his old\nmaster was still alive and sojourning in the same city, and Jewish\netiquette required that a scholar give no legal opinion of his own as\nlong as his teacher was around. The writer of that letter was so sure\nthat Nahray’s opinion would be heeded by the court, however, that\nhe asked the addressee to find out his opinion by approaching him\npersonally.$!\n\nThe answer of the legal expert would not decide the case auto-\nmatically. In one letter the writer expresses his alarm over the fact\nthat the Nagid Abraham Maimonides had sent his responsum to a\njudge Elijah (b. Zechariah) with instructions and the latter had taken\nno action as yet.*? About two hundred years earlier, around 1030, a\nman, writing from Egypt, reports having secured responsa from Rabbi\nHananel (the famous author) of Qayrawan, Tunisia, and from Mas-\nliah, the Jewish chief judge of Palermo, Sicily, both being in his\nfavor, but still the case was pending and, one gets the impression, was\nnot developing to the writer’s satisfaction.33 Around 1140, Ezekiel b.\nNathanel complains to his brother, the India trader Halfon, that his\ncase had struck a snag because the four scholars on the bench were of\ndivided opinion. Two opined according to Hay, the Gaon of Bagh-\ndad (d. 1038), and two according to the RIF, Rabbi Isaac of Fez,\nMorocco (d. 1103).

No doubt, these responsa\nhad been secured by the addressee during one of his business trips to\nthat country, trips we know about through other Geniza letters. He\ncertainly had informed his brother about their contents; now the\ncourt wanted to see the originals.3¢\n\nAfter receipt of the opinions of the legal experts, a settlement\noutside court would be attempted first. Throughout our records, sev-\neral arbiters, never a single one, are referred to, and, as with the cora-\nposition of a court, a large number of arbiters was considered more\nconducive to equity than a small one. In a little town in the Nile\nDelta we find nine persons mentioned by name acting as a board of\narbitration with a circuit judge sent [rom the capital presiding. The\ncircuit judge was advised by his superior to attempt a decision by\nlaw only if arbitration failed.?> Many lawsuits mentioned in the\nGeniza were settled by such agrcements. In one letter we even find a\ncomplaint about judges “unwilling to make decisions, trying only to\nreach a settlement.” 3¢\n\nIf the parties did not come to an agreement, the court would often\nnot hand down a judgment immediately, but would first make sure\nto have the support of its superiors, one or more of the three chief\njudges in the capital, or if the latter themselves were dealing with a\nlawsuit, of the Gaon or Nagid who had appointed them. Many\nqueries preserved by the Geniza or in the collections of responsa are\njust such veiled feelers. Modern scholars have wondered about quer-\nies that contained questions to which Jewish law gave simple and\nclear-cut answers. They were consequently inclined to believe that\nthose asking them were mediocre scholars. This is a misunderstand-\ning of the procedire. The judge submitting the question was not in\ndoubt about the answer, as can be seen from the way he presented\nthe matter, but he wanted to have a ruling from above in order to\nfortify his own position. Therefore, we frequently find in the answers\nthe cryptic remark: “If the case is indeed as stated in the query, the\nlaw is such and such.”\n\nThe parties, too, after having failed to reach a settlement, would\napply to the high court of the yeshiva or, later, to that in the Egyptian\ncapital and, in particular, to the Nagid, whereupon those approached\nwould instruct the local court how to deal with the case. The strange\nprocedure of applying to a higher authority before the lower court\nhad made its decision corresponds somehow to the procedure of ap-\npeal, which, although not unknown, was not the established and\norganized course of action it is in modern law.

This\naspect of medieval juridical procedure is entirely unfamiliar to the\nmodetn reader. An oath in court today is a mere formality. In medi-\neval times it was a matter of life and death. For swearing mcant\ntroubling God to be present as witness, and “the Lord does not hold\nhim guiltless that takes His name in vain,” the third of the Ten\nCommandments (Exodus 20:7). In order to impress the person\nobliged to give an oath, the ceremony was held in the synagogue. A\nTorah scroll was removed from the ark and clad in black; the com-\nmunal bier and the ceremonial trumpet, the shofar, were brought in\nto remind those present of death and the last Judgment, and then\nthe oath had to be given “in the name of God and the Ten Com-\nmandments.” In a document from Syracuse, Sicily, we read that the\nparty giving the oath was even obliged to read the Ten Command-\nments 2loud from the Torah scroll opened before him. A woman,\ntoo, would make a sworn declaration in the section of the synagogue\nreserved for males and keep a Torah scroll in her hands while doing\n50.37 These paraphernalia were believed to be so essential that Mai-\nmonides was asked whether an oath on a mere codex of the Bible\nwas valid at all.38 A merchant would risk his reputation, even if the\noath given by him was true. A false oath was regarded not only as a\ngreat sin, disqualifying the guilty from serving in future as a witness,\nbut was also a disgrace and even a calamity for the community at\nlarge. Therefore, we find in numerous Geniza records that even when\neverything was ready for the oath, some well-meaning elders would\nintervene and arrange at last for a settlement.3®\n\nFrom the various types of statutory oath fixed by biblical and\ntalmudic law is to be distinguished the procedural “ban in general\nterms,” herem setam; it is normally listed in the Geniza records to-\ngether with the former, when one party releases another of all obliga-\ntions. The “ban in general terms” served as a kind of lie detector,\ninasmuch as a ban and the most awesome curses were pronounced\non anyone who evaded an obligation defined in the pronouncement,\nas well as on anyone else who was able to testify about the where-\nabouts of that person or his obligation and ability to pay. The\nherem was of two forms, the first being promulgated in the presence\nof the person accused of evading an obligation. The accused was\nobliged to answer “Amen,\"” that is, he took upon himself the curses\nand the ban in case the accusation was true. The second form was\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Since\npeople were very mobile in those days, the ban had to be pro-\nnounced in different localities and countries, in particular on holi-\ndays when it was customary to assemble in the main synagogues.\n\nThe wording of this ban had to be of utmost precision in order not\nto leave loopholes by which the accused could escape responsibility.\nIn a Hebrew letter, sent from Palestine to the capital of Egypt with\nthe request to pronounce such a herem in the latter country, the\nwriter, the Gaon Solomon b. Judah, gives the text of the ban in\nArabic, to make sure that all details were understood and noticed\nby everyone attending the promulgation. There are other texts of\nthis type, albeit interspersed with many Hebrew words. The pro-\ncedure is well illustrated in the following passage from the letter of a\ncommunity official in Jerusalem who was asked from Old Cairo to\npronounce the “ban in general terms” for a merchant in Egypt called\nIbn al-Hijaziyya (“the son of the woman from Hijaz.” In those days,\nJews still lived in northern Arabia): “I have already informed you\nin one of my previous letters that in all the provincial towns and in\nJerusalem on the Hosanna day [the seventh day of the Feast of\nTabernacles] I excommunicated everyone who owed a dinar or a\ndirhem or merchandise or the fulfillment of a contract to Ibn al-\nHijaziyya, or had taken receipts or money orders belonging to them\n[thus!], or denounced them to a governmental authority, or who\ncaused them any other harm. I shall renew this pronouncement on\nevery holiday.” 40\n\nAn interesting combination of procedural ban and statutory oath\nis found in a holograph ruling by the Nagid Abraham Maimonides.\nA man suspecting the trustworthiness of another had first to attend\na ban in general terms on anyone suspecting that person of being\nprepared to swear falsely, whereupon the latter was to proceed with\ngiving the required oath.f!\n\nMany, if not most, court records conclude with the declaration that\nthe parties had not made a secret deposition in another court which\nwould impair the validity of the undertakings forming the object of\nthe record concerned.

Confronted with this\nnew situation, the tarrying debtor ceded to the pressure of “upright,\npious, and peace-loving” elders and agreed to pay an additional 6\ndinars.42\n\nThe handing down of a judgment did not always mark the end of\na lawsuil. Its execution, even with the aid of the state authorities, as\nwe shall see, sometimes caused great trouble. If the losing party was\na notable of high standing, the court tried to give him opportunity\nto save face by satisfying his opponent before promulgation of the\nverdict.43 The last resort against a recalcitrant party was excommu-\nnication (see the preceding section).\n\nIn accordance with ancient Palestinian custom, the Jewish courts\nin Egypt held their sessions on Mondays and Thursdays. This is\nattested by hundreds of records, even for the congregation of the\nIragians in Old Cairo.#* The original reason for this arrangement\nwas the fact that these two days were market days in Palestine; the\npeasants brought their products to the towns and settled their legal\naffairs on those occasions. The svnagogue seized the opportunity for\nthe instruction of the masses and fixed readings from the Five Books\nof Moses for these days, which thus became “the holy weekdays,”\nhonored by the pious by the abstention from food.\n\nIslam adopted this custom and made fasting on Mondays and\nThursdays particularly meritorious.#> Dispensing justice on these\ndays must also have been regarded as a work of piety in Islam. Thus\nwe find the Fatimid caliph Hafiz (1131-1149) holding his levees on\nMondays and Thursdays, and the famous Saladin is reported to have\ndone the same, holding public audiences on these days, in which he\nreceived and settled complaints.

Since everyone came to\nsynagogue on those days in order to listen to the obligatory readings\nfrom the Torah, it was easy to give a case the publicity needed and\nto find enough persons ready to serve as witnesses or adjunct judges.\nWhen the Palestinian yeshiva moved to Cairo, its high court held\nits meetings on Wednesdays and Fridays, presumably in order to\ngive the judges of the twin cities the opportunity to sit together in\nmore important cases, as we indeed see in the documents preserved 47\n\nThe judges did not remain idle during the rest of the week.

This seems to prove that, at least in the\ncases concerned, the documents were kept not in an archive in a\nsynagogue but, rather, in the home of the official concerned (perhaps\nbecause it was regarded as safer and more conducive to privacy).5\nThe books of formularies, which were such important instruments\nfor the application of the law and are for us such an invaluable\nsource for its knowledge, grew out of copies of actual documents pre-\nserved in those primitive but precious archives.\"> We are also able\nto reconstruct the books of forms from which the scribes of the Geniza\ncopied, especially in the case of court clerks such as Hillel b. Eli\n(1066-1108) and Halfon ha-Levi b. Manasse (1100-1188) from whose\nhands a great number of records have come down.5® Clearly, differ-\nent Jegal usages and variant scribal traditions are reflected in the\nGeniza. As late as 1250, the Book of Documents (shetarot), or formu-\nlary, of Hlay Gaon (d. 1038) was still studied in Egypt, but even the\ndocuments written at the end of the eleventh century by no means\nconform with the formulations prescribed by Hay.57\n\nOf particular interest is a badly damaged piece of vellum bearing\nentries by the hands of two scribes separated in time by about half a\ncentury. On the main part certain specific conditions of a marriage\ncontract are written in the bold hand of Abraham b. Aaron, and en-\ntirely in Aramaic. On the head of the page a few lines, in the smallish\nand elegant script of Halfon b. Manasse, are addressed to his Nagid,\nsummarizing some of those stipulations in the Arabic language and\nasking permission to include them in a marriage contract. Halfén, by\nsubmitting the ancient formula to the Nagid, obviously wished to em-\nphasize that the conditions in question were in accordance with\nancient local custom. The interesting point is that Abraham him-\nself wrote his documents in Arabic, which everyone understood, and\nnot in Aramaic, which had become obsolete. The conditions were\nspecific, but by no means exceptional: (1) The young couple will live\nwith his wife’s parents (and not the husband’s, as usual; marriage in\nthose parts and times was patrilocal); () he is not permitted to move\nto another town, except if she wishes so; (3) money carned by her\nthrough work will be her personal property (and not go to the com-\nmon pool, as was the rule); (4) he is not permitted to acquire a maid-\nservant except with her consent and must dismiss her as soon as she\ndemands.58\n\nIn short, the study of the legal records of the Cairo Geniza is a very\nrewarding and promising field of rescarch.

Thus one\nwould expect that the Geniza, a repository of writings originating\nin one of these minority groups, contained particularly rich infor-\nmation about the court and the machinery of the government. This,\nhowever, is not the case. The reason for the deficiency is to be sought\nmainly in the fact that the courtiers and government officials, as well\nas the richer merchants connected with the court, lived in Cairo, the\nnewly founded residence, while the Geniza was attached to a syna-\ngogue in Fustat, or Old Cairo, the former capital of Islamic Egypt.\n\nThis state of affairs is illustrated by many Geniza records. A wo-\nman, writing from the capital to her brother, reports among other\ngossip that a high official was fired from his post by the vizier al-\nMa’miin (1121-1125) and was asked to leave Cairo and to take up his\ndomicile in Fustat.! Presumably that man, like other well-to-do Jews,\npossessed houses in both cities, but preferred to live at the seat of the\ngovernment. An India traveler, recommending to his brother two\ndistinguished business friends from Morocco, who were returning\nfrom the Orient in 1134, admonishes him to receive them well and\nto put them up—not in Fustat, but in Cairo.2 The Jewish court\nphysicians who served three generations of Fatimid caliphs and\nviziers during the eleventh century all lived in the new city, as we\nknow either from letters addressed to them or from express evidence.\n\nGoitein, S.

Only\nduring the month of the autumn holidays did he reside in Old Cairo\nand, as we may assume, it was then that he received the numerous\npetitions and letters that we still find in the Geniza3 The Jewish\nupper class in general is represented in the Geniza by such requests\nfor help or expressions of gratitude or by poems addressed to their\nmembers as well as by references to them in other letters. Only very\nfew private letters emanating from their own pens have been pre-\nserved.\n\nThere may have been other reasons for this deficiency. Although\nquite a number of persons belonging to the higher Jewish society of\nthose days seem to have been good Hebrew scholars, they might have\nused the Arabic script and not the Hebrew cursive for their private\ncorrespondence. Thus there was no reason to confide their letters to\nthe Geniza. In a letter written at the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury we find the following remark with regard to an illustrious\nphysician: “I do not know whether our lord ‘The Successful’ is fluent\nin [the] Hebrew [cursive] so that I could write to him. Please find out\nand let me know.” 4\n\nMoreover, some of the more prominent Jewish families of the\nGeniza period, such as the Tustaris, belonged to the Karaite persua-\nsion and therefore had no opportunity to deposit their writings in a\nRabbanite synagogue. For all these reasons, it is only in exceptional\ncases that we find an “inside story” of the Jewish upper class, as well\nas of the court and the administration with which they were con-\nnected. What we mostly have is seen from outside and from below.\nIt is the government as reflected in the mind of those who had little,\nif any, direct contact with it, the middle and lower classes.\n\nOn the other hand, the few “inside stories” preserved are colorful\nand highly instructive. The eccentric oculist and surgeon of the sultan\nal-Malik al-‘Aziz (Saladin’s son; ruled 1193-1198) describes to his\nparents how he reacted upon hearing tidings of the death of his\nyounger brother. In the middle of the street he threw off all his clothes\nexcept his underwear, ran home, and put ashes on his head and face\n“from all the ovens in the house.” Immediately, the whole entourage\nof the sultan turned up to express their sympathy and to persuade\nthe mourner to show more moderation in his grief. First came all the\ncourt physicians, three even accompanied by their wives (although\nthe oculist himself seems to have been unmarried.) They were fol-\nlowed by the chief commander of the guards and the sultan’s fagih,\nor house chaplain. After the faqth had reported the physician’s pre-\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In conclusion, the writer describes the\nsubsequent visits of the courtiers, but the rather poor response of the\nJewish community.\n\nIn another letter, the same oculist, writing from Jerusalem, reports\nthat his masters, al-Malik al-*Aziz and al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam (the lat-\nter’s nephew), were laying siege to Damascus and that he was unable\nto get through to them to ask for a leave. Although ill himself, he\nvisited the sultan’s palace every other day, obviously to treat the\nfamilies and the retinue of the two princes mentioned.®\n\nWhen a libel was brought before the sultan al-Malik al-‘Adil\n(Saladin’s brother, 1198-1218) against the Nagid Abraham Maimon-\nides, who also happened to be a court physician, the sultan in person\nhanded the document to his faithful servant. This version of the story,\nas a letter written by one of the Nagid’s adversaries asserts, was the\none promulgated by some of the Nagid’s followers. The truth, ac-\ncording to the writer, was that a clerk devoted to the Nagid managed\nto remove it.

The\nopposing party was more lavish and “money answers all things”\n(Ecclesiastes 10:19).

It concerned an official of the dar al-sarf, the\ncaliphal exchange, who, after being married in the Egyptian capital\nin 1050, allegedly intended to marry again in Ascalon, Palestine.\nThis was not only against the standards accepted at that time by\nJewish religion, but was disapproved, albeit for quite different rea-\nsons, also by the government. The president of the court admonishes\nthe addressee not to use these allegations, which according to the\nbest of his knowledge were untrue, in order to secure the downfall of\nthat official, but, on the contrary, to exert his influence to stop any\nmachinations against the latter. The precarious position of govern-\nment servants in general is illustrated more than once in the course\nof this chapter.1?\n\nTurning now to the popular concept of government as culled from\nthe Geniza papers, we realize that a bottomless chasm divided the\nrulers from the ruled.

The picture of most of the\nFatimid rulers of Egypt, as left to us by the Muslim historians, is\none of incompetence, debauchery, abject intrigue, and sadistic\ncruelty. Nowhere in the countless letters preserved in the Geniza do\nwe find an allusion to this state of affairs or any word of disapproval\nof criticism. Rulers are mentioned in connection with acts of justice\nor favors granted by them, or when their armies were, or were ex-\npected to be, victorious in battle. The opposite, states of oppression\nand lawlessness, as well as military or economic disasters, are never\nattributed to the government, but are accepted as a decree of God, or\nsimply as a fact.

For with regard to them the writers\ncould hope that the influence of the Jewish notables was sufficient to\nbring about their dismissal or at least to stop their misconduct.\n\nIt is instructive to consider briefly the role of the viceroy al-Malik\nal-Afdal (1094-1121), who is referred to in the Geniza papers\nmore {requently than any other man in power. Both the Muslim his-\ntorians and the writers of the letters preserved in the Geniza are\nunanimous in praising him. Still, according to our taste, he could\nhardly be called the model of a ruler. At his death, he left a harem of\neight hundred concubines, of whom fifty were favorites. Once, when\nhe saw one of his slave girls looking out the window, he immediately\nhad her beheaded. The historian who reports this fact to us does not\nmention it with horror, but with admiration, meaning that al-Afdal\nwas 2 he-man who jealously demanded exclusive attention. In cor-\nroboration, verses to this effect, recited by the viceroy when the head\nof the executed girl was presented to him, are quoted,\n\n‘While I looked at her, she looked at her shadow—\n\nBut I am too proud a man to share attention with anyone.\nI am a jealous man; were the moon like myself,\n\nHe would not tolerate the company of the stars.*\n\nMoreover, the historians cannot find words enough to describe the\nfabulous riches, the gigantic treasures of nonsensical rarities amassed\nby the mighty man. Again, this is taken as a sign of his prowess and\noutstanding ability. No one asks at what price such riches were\nbrought together. We, who know from the Geniza how the common\npeople lived at that time, are aware of the fact that such extravagance\ncould be bought only by keeping millions in misery.\n\nStill, al-Malik al-Afdal is extolled in the Geniza letters in the most\nglowing terms. In part, this may have owed to the efficiency of Fati-\nmid propaganda. In part, we have to pay attention to the fact re-\nported by the Muslim historians, that his rule, like that of his father\nbefore him, was particularly beneficial for the merchants, and, nat-\nurally, most of the letters preserved originated in the middle class\nengaged in commerce.’s Even so, it must have been the general char-\nacter of their rule which earned al-Afdal and any other deserving ruler\nof his time the gratitude of their subjects. Government in those days\nwas not concerned with the welfare of its subjects. It had to provide\nonly two things, seemingly so obvious, but so rarely to be had: secur-\nity and justice.

Similarly,\nrulers are glorified because justice flourished in their day or they are\nreminded in petitions addressed to them that it was inconsistent with\ntheir good name that injustice should prevail under their rule. Al-\nMalik al-Afdal is praised repeatedly for his justice. In addition, like\nother popular sovereigns, he seeins to have been accessible to humble\npetitioners, even from the countryside.!?\n\nA story about al-Afdal and a Jew, recounted by a Muslim source,\nis particularly noteworthy. When the viceroy laid siege to Alexandria,\nwhich then was held by Nizar, the eldest or one of the elder sons of\nthe late caliph who had been chosen as successor by the Isma‘ili\nhierarchy, a rich Jew in that city was conspicuous in denouncing and\ncursing al-Afdal who had passed over the legitimate successor and\nput on the throne the youngest of seven brothers, a mere youth of\neighteen. But the city was taken and the Jew was brought before\nal-Aldal, who scolded him and ordered him to be executed. The Jew\npleaded for his life and promised to pay the viceroy five thousand\ndinars if he pardoned him. Al-Afdal set him free without taking a\npenny from him, “lest people should say [ killed him in order to take\nhis money.” 18 Presumably it was not only the opportunity for a noble\ngesture which recommended clemency in this case. What the Jew\nstood for was legitimacy, and al-Afdal, who bore the title Shihinshah,\nKing of Kings, and had just succeeded his own father as viceroy of\nthe Fatimid empire, was perhaps not unsusceptible to devotion to\nsuch a cause.\n\nThe minority groups, and perhaps the common people in general,\nseem to have been loyalist by conviction: a stable though oppressive\ngovernment was preferable to disorder and turmoil. The person of\nthe ruler was sacrosanct. One swore by the king’s life or head, as one\nswore by one’s religion or by the Torah, and one would even mention\nthe Torah and “the King” in one breath while making a public\ndeclaration in the synagogue.l® Swearing falsely while using “the\nKing's” name was a crime deserving heavy punishment.2° Even in\nprivate letters, the name of the ruler would be invariably accom-\npanied by good wishes, such as “may God give him victory and make\nhis days perennial,” and not only in Arabic, but also in Hebrew, as\nwhen the phrase “may his Rock [God] preserve him” is attached to\nthe name of the caliph al-Hakim in one letter and to that of a provin-\ncial governor in another (where, by the way, he is described as having\ndone harm to a Jewish scholar).2!

Letters written in Arabic use the same word for “favor”\nas that applied to a favorite concubine; in Hebrew, the corresponding\nphrase, so familiar from the Book of Esther (2:17; 5:2, 8; 7:3) is ap-\nplied.32 The mysterious gift of being acceptable appears to have been\nthe main equipment of the courtier. Moreover, the protection of\nHeaven is usually implored against all those who envy the addressee\nand intrigue against him. The phrasing of such wishes gives the\nimpression that the writer does not speak in general terms, but re-\nfers to specific situations Iaden with danger. There is no need to\nremind of the downfall and assassination of the “vizier” Aba Sa‘d\nTustari in 1047, and the same fate of Joseph b. Samuel of Granada\nin 1066, events fully reflected in the Geniza. But even where positions\nof power were not lost in such a brutal way, royal disfavor frequently\nseems to have terminated the role of high Jewish dignitaries who\ncombined the leadership of their community with the service of the\nruler. This has been assumed with regard to Jacob b. Amram, the\nNagid of the Jews of Tunisia around 1060 and may well have been\nthe case with Samuel b, Hananya, the Nagid in Egypt (1140-1159);\nfor his two sons are repeatedly called his successors designate, but we\nnever hear of anyone of them having obtained an office ‘within the\nJewish community. A poem praising Samuel’s son and successor\ndesignate, presumably when he assumed the post of physician-in-\nattendance to a lady of the caliph’s household, says this: “He has be-\ncome a son to the royal house, like Moses to the daughter of\nPharaoh.” But he must have fallen into disfavor and so lost his quali-\nfication of future Nagid.3?

We have a lengthy letter\nin Hebrew written by a man who claimed to have been in charge\nof al-Malik al-Afdal’s “granaries, fields, villages, treasures, and stores\nof food, drink, and clothing.” The writer must have been a European\nJew, as evident from the way he spells Arabic names. After describing\nhow he successfully withstood all the intrigues and calumnies of his\nadversaries, he remarks: “Then came the fateful day,” and, without\ngiving any explanation, he describes how he lost his position, was\nrobbed of all his property, put into prison, and tortured, while his\nchildren “were removed from him,” which possibly means that they\nhad to fiee the country.3® In a long Hebrew poem, one Solomon is\ncongratulated on being elevated, like a second Joseph, from prison\nto the rank of the “deputy of the King” and “Scribe.” Even most\nprominent people would tremble before him, when he shouted at\nthem and he used (of course) his prominent position to feed the poor\nand to do other works of mercy.3®\n\nWhen one high official was dismissed, all those appointed or ap-\nproved by him faced the same [ate. The situation was not dissimilar\nto that of a change in party rule in a present-day state or municipal\ncorporation. Thus, under al-Malik al-Kamil when the governor of\nAlexandria fell into disfavor, a Davidite nasi who was a physician (and\npresumably in attendance to that governor) lost his position as head\nof the Jewish community in that city, as well as the government\nstipend given to him in this capacity. Moreover, his misconduct as\njudge and community leader was laid bare.3?\n\nAs we have already seen, the family of an official who lost his of-\nfice was alfected as well. The Geniza has preserved a huge circular\nurging all Jewish communities to assist a man whose father had been\nin the service of the king of Granada, but fell into disgrace, where-\nupon his son had to leave the country.3® In general, the family was\nheld responsible for the misconduct of any of its members who were\nin the government service or had other connections with it. There-\nfore, as soon as a government official or any other person who had\nhad dealings with the government died, all his belongings were con-\nfiscated and held under seal until his conduct was cleared.

This is vividly brought home in a\nGeniza letier referring to Saladin’s grand-nephew al-Malik al-Nasir\nDa’ud (“the victorious King David”), in which he is assured of the\nwriter’s long-standing and unfailing loyalty. Nisir is called in the\nletter “the sultan, may God make his victories glorious,” but we cer-\ntainly do not err much in our assumption that the letter was written\nat a time when he had already lost most of his possessions. Kings and\ncommoners were brought nearer to each other through the ups and\ndowns of fortune.t®\n\nThe downfall of high government officials, especially those belong-\ning to the minority groups, was so taken for granted that it was\nreported by historians even if it did not take place in fact. The most\nconspicuous instance is that of the Jewish chief secretary of Damascus,\nManasse b. Ibrahim Ibn al-Qazzaz, who had been appointed by the\ncaliph al-‘Aziz (d. 996) at the recommendation of the Christian vizier\nIsa (Arabic for Jesus) b. Nestorius. Ibn Taghribirdi, a late but\nprominent historian, reports that both fell into disfavor with al-‘Aziz\nand were crucified on his order. But ‘Isa suffered such a fate only after\nhaving been reappointed by al“Aziz’ mad successor al-Hikim, and\nIbn al-Qazziz died peacefully, as is evident from a Hebrew poem\ndedicated to his son.4!

The\nqadi, or judge, the wali, or head of the local police, and the muhlasib,\nthe superintendent of the market, all had important administrative\nfunctions. For reasons of expediency I treat the last group separately.\n\nGovernment service was called either ‘amal, “work,” a term going\nback to the ancient Near East, or khidma, “service,” which is also of\npre-Islamic origin. Thus a letter from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, written\nshortly after 1057, speaks of “our coreligionists in the administration\n(‘amal) of the King of Granada,” while a document from Old Cairo,\ndated 1140, in order to express the idea “the government gives him\nno post” uses the word khidma. These examples could easily be mul-\ntiplied. Letters in Hebrew most appropriately use the biblical term\n“those who do the work of the King” (Esther 9:3 and elsewhere) a\nphrase borrowed from the administration of the ancient Persian\nempire, which served as model also for the Arabs.!\n\nThe usual designation for a government officer was katib, scribe,\nequally applied to the head of a department in the central govern-\nment and to a humble clerk in a provincial town. Thus, the “Secre-\ntary of the State,” Abu ’I-Barakiit Judah ha-Kohen, who in letters\naddressed or referring to him, is accorded the epithet “the great\nprince,” “the Mordecai of his time,” and a dozen other grand Hebrew\ntitles, was officially only a katib, the same as “the scribe from Tinnis,”\nfor whom a document containing fifty-two closely written lines was\nmade out in 1088 regarding a debt of half a gold piece. Even a little\nboy who happened to be born into a family of government servants\nwould bear the proud name Zayn al-Kuttab, “The Ornament of the\nScribes” (the one referred to in the Geniza happened to be a grandson\nof the “Secretary of the State” just mentioned), and girls from such\nfamilies would not infrequently be called Sitt al-Kuttab, “The\nQuecn of the Scribes,” although it is not quite certain whether they\nactually learned how to write.2\n\nThe exact position of a katib in the hierarchy of officialdom would\nbe defined by the honorary titles and epithets conferred on him by\nhis superiors. The Geniza contains a plethora of them. Lower offi-\ncials had to be satisfied with an honorific epithet such as “The\nSound,” bestowed also on physicians.® Those higher up were honored\nwith one or more titles lauding the services they rendered to the state.\nThus the Abu ’l-Barakat mentioned above bore at least two such\ntitles: Thiqat al-Mulk, “Trusted [Official] of the State,” and ‘Amid\nal-Dawla, “Support of the Government.” The first title was received\nby him first and is rather common.

It was begun in January, 1113,\nand took a full six years to complete. The viceroy al-Malik al-Afdal\nwas very angry that the new waterway was named alter its constructor\nrather than after him, and he put Abu 'I-Munajji into prison. Abu\n'I-Munajja managed to obtain a Koran: he copied it and signed his\n‘work: “Written by Abu '-Munajja, the Jew” and sent it to the bazaar\nof the books in Alexandria, where it caused an uproar. Asked about\nthe purpose of his undertaking, he declared that he wanted to be\nliberated from prison by death. Al-Afdal, however, understood and\nset him free; he was again employed in government service, as al-\nluded to in a poem dedicated to him. Glearly the man who had\nbrought relief and prosperity to such a large stretch of land had\nalready become a legendary figure in his lifetime. Thus it was told\nthat a poisonous snake was hidden in the room in which he was con-\nfined but was fed by him with milk whenever it came out with the\neffect that it did him no harm.$\n\nThe references to Abu 'l-Munajja in the Geniza are of a more\nprosaic nature. In a document dated 1098, we learn he lived in\nDamietta not far from the scene of his later activities and transferred\nmoney from Old Cairo to Syria.” Here he bears the title Thiqat\nal-Mulk. After distinguishing himself further in the service of the\nstate, he was called Saniyyu 'I-Dawla wa-Aminuha, “Exalted by the\nGovernment and Trusted By It.”8 The title Thiqat al-Mulk was\nborne also by the chief qadi of the Fatimid empire under al-Afdal,?\nand the second, Amin al-Dawla, was even more distinguished, since\nits first bearer was Ibn ‘Ammir, the actual ruler of Egypt in the early\nyears of the caliph al-Hakim.1® It seems strange that under the same\nruler a Jewish official should be given a title that was borne by the\nhighest Muslim dignitary and by which the latter was commonly\nknown.

A comprehensive study\nof the rich data in Muslim and Christian sources, as compared with\nthe copious instances of titles referred to in the Geniza, would prob-\nably yield more clarity on this subject, which is paralleled in Byzan-\ntine bureaucracy and ceremonials.!!\n\nExamples have already been offered for the wellknown fact that\nthe Muslim government kept tight control over the financial affairs\nof its officials, or rather regarded the riches amassed by them as its\nown, often culminating in wholesale confiscation or at least seques-\ntration of the estates they left. The Geniza shows that the govern-\nment interested itself in the family life of its employees as well. A\nSicilian Jew, who had married a wife in Damascus, was about to get\na government post in Cairo. He was told, however, that he would not\nobtain the appointment unless his wife followed him to the Egyptian\ncapital (but she refused). He then approached the rabbinical court\nwith the request to be permitted to marry a local woman on condition\nthat he deposit with the court the indemnity due his first wife in case\nof a divorce. The record reporting the granting of this request em-\nphasizes that this policy of the government was well known to the\njudges. We have already had a similar case, where a high official of\nthe caliphal exchange of Cairo suspected of having married a woman\nin Ascalon, Palestine, was in danger of losing his post. The reason for\nthis principle is obvious: when the official’s family lived in another\ncountry, the government did not have a firm hold on him; if he fled,\nthere was no one to be taken as hostage.12\n\nExact statements about salaries and emoluments are rare in the\nGeniza, rarer even than those about commercial profits, and the\nreason for this reticence is the same in both cases: one was reluctant\nto confide these delicate details to paper. We read about salaries only\nin a specific case, for instance, when a person unacceptable to both\nthe writer and the addressee of a letter was appointed to a post that\nthey would have preferred to see occupied by one of their own fac-\ntion. Thus in a report to a high official in Saladin’s time (ca. 1180) the\nwriter mentions with regret that X. was made musharif, or controller,\nof the revenue of a town, and was promised 180 dinars and 100 waybas\n(about 2,500 pounds) of wheat per year.

The term na’ib, “deputy,” which we have al-\nready met as designating a judge, could also refer to a tax-farmer, for,\nas we shall see, it was common practice for the bigger damins to sub-\nlease their rights to minor substitutes.2\n\nResearch on the subject becomes even more complicated by the\nfact that, as a rule, a farmer of revenue is called simply “al-damin”\nwithout any further definition, and only the context of the document\nor a reference to the same person in another Geniza record enables\nus to determine with more precision the nature and extent of his\ncontract.2? On the other hand, references to this institution are so\nnumerous in the Geniza that a systematic search for them is able to\nprovide important source material for this interesting aspect of med-\nieval administration.\n\nTrying now to classify the different types of tax-farming, we find\nthat most farmers of revenue are mentioned with the name of a local-\nity attached to them. Fourteen examples of such references are given\nin a note.2* Where a village or a small town is concerned, it is perhaps\nreasonable to assume that the dimin collected all the various dues\npayable by that place, although this assumption is by no means cer-\ntain. It was common practice “to travel to a locality in the Rif [the\nEgyptian countryside] and to farm its revenue,” or for a woman from\nOld Cairo “to join her husband, who was the dimin of a place in the\nRif.\"25 The father of a profligate son was afraid that bad people\nwould induce the youth to stand security for a village in the Rif. “You\nwill eat and drink and your father will pay,” that is, the income from\nthe revenue would serve the boy as a regular source of income, while\nthe old man would be held responsible by the government.28\n\nWhere a larger provincial town or the capital itself is mentioned\nas the domain of a tax-farmer, the reference is no doubt to only one\nspecific type of fiscal income. Thus, 385 dinars as ‘ibra, or yearly as-\nsessment, for a provincial capital like al-Mahalla, can represent only\na fraction of the taxes to be collected there. Most probably it was the\ntax on silk-weaving and dyeing, the farming of which was so popular\namong Jews.?\" In a letter concerning (New) Cairo, the context clearly\nimplies that it was this tax of which the damin al-qahira mentioned\nwas in charge.?8 Even in a small place like Atfih, otherwise known as\na center of flaxgrowing, the damin, as the continuation of the docu-\nment proves, was concerned only with taxes on silk work, and for an\nequally small locality, Qalyiib, this is said expressly.

There are other examples below. Since the Jews were so conspicu-\nous in the silk industry, they were best qualified to take care of the\ntaxes levied on it.2?\n\nThe dues on dyeing and selling silk constituted only part of the\nrevenue “from the market” in general. We have already had the case\nof “the judge of the Jews” in Manbij, a town in Syria, who was also\nal-damin lil-siiq, the tax-farmer of the bazaar of that locality. Natur-\nally, this office was not very popular. We read, for example, in a letter\nwith regard to another Jewish scholar: “God forbid that he should\nfarm the market, as has been rumored, a task affecting so many core-\nligionists.”$® When a merchant received a payment, “the master of\nthe market, namely the tax-farmers [thus, in the plural]” would se-\nquester it until any claims on dues from former transactions were\nsatisfied.®! In at least one case, the tax-farming of a locality (without\nfurther definition) refers to that of its market. On the other hand,\nthere were such specialized items as damin birsim al-iskandariyya,\n“farmer of the taxes on the lands sown with Egyptian clover in the\ndistrict of Alexandria,” illustrating that provision of the city with\nvital fodder for riding beasts was the concern of a separate branch of\nthe administration.32\n\nAn important field of activity for tax-farmers was the revenue from\nthe sale of houses or parts of houses. A request to stop the machina-\ntions of an overreaching damin dealing with this revenue reveals\nmany interesting details.33 In the many deeds concerning the transfer\nof immobile property this tax is referred to only in specific instances.\n\nFinally, the collection of customs duties was also farmed out. The\nGeniza refers to this fact with regard to the Nile ports of Old and\nNew Cairo and to the busy seaport of ‘Aydhib on the coast of East\nAfrica. The Muslim traveler Ibn Jubayr reports the same for the\nPalestinian harbor city Acre, which, at the time of his visit, was in\nChristian hands, Still, it seems doubtful that this usage was general\nand permanent during the period discussed in this book. Otherwise\none would expect to find more references to it in the numerous let-\nters and accounts regarding persons and goods passing through cus-\ntoms stations.*\n\nIt should be noted that in some localities the poll tax incumbent\non non-Muslims was also farmed out.

Samuel, the Spaniard (ca.\n1100).3% 1t seems, however, that the collection of the poll tax in smaller\nplaces formed a part of the type of tax-farming discussed first, that\nwhich comprised all the payments due from one area. In his brilliant\nanalysis of an Ayyubid source concerning the revenue from the Fay-\nyam district, Claude Cahen shows that the jaliya was included in the\ngeneral estimate of the revenue from that district.36\n\nA daman, or appointment as tax-farmer, was obtained either from\na Jocal revenue office, or from a dignitary to whom a certain revenue\nwas allocated, or from the central government. A man writing from a\nsmall town in or around 1096 claims to have received one of his ap-\npointments from the father and predecessor of al-Malik al-Afdal.8?\nSimilarly, a document made out in Damietta in 1106, states that the\nfarmer of the tax on dyeing and selling silk in that district held this\nprivilege by a rescript from the sovereign.3® The revenue from al-\nMatariyya (Heliopolis) was leased from an amir called in a fourteenth-\ncentury letter Malik al-Umara’, “The King of the Amirs.”?® In gen-\neral, the diwan, the government office concerned with the tax in ques-\ntion, or its director, ‘@mil, or controller, mush(a)rif, is referred to as\ngranting the damin.\n\nCompetition was keen, and a dimin had to work hard both to pro-\ncure and to retain his post. The officials of the relevant departments,\nlocal and central, had to be won over for the applicant’s case and the\nsame applied to the local police and its head in the capital. For with-\nout the help of the police the tax-farmer was lost. No one would pay\nhim. Although the amount to be guaranteed by the tax-farmer (also\ncalled damin) and the term of his office were fixed in the patent of\nhis appointment, it must have been common practice to force him to\npay more as soon as a higher bid was made by someone else. In a later\ncentury, when public mores had sunk to a low level, outbidding a\nfellow tax-farmer had become a rampant social evil and was punished\nwith excommunication.\n\nThe tax-farmer was usually a capitalist who stood security for a\nlarger district and subleased his rights to a host of substitutes who did\nthe actual collection of the taxes or practiced monopoly in the area\nallotted to them. In a contract dated 1138, a damin grants to another\nthe license for selling and dyeing silk in a certain quarter of Old\nCairo against 18 dinars per month (not a small sum) for the duration\nof his own tenure of office. The capitalist promises not to accept any\nhigher offer and not to discontinue the lease for any other reason. In\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The same amount, together with a hundred\nhorses, had to be delivered by the new tax-farmer of Basra every year.\nWith a few exceptions, suras of such magnitude do not occur in the\nGeniza records.48\n\nTax-farming was rampant in the Roman and Persian empires and,\nas the New Testament and talmudic literature eloquently testify,\nweighed heavily on the population. It seems to me, however, that the\nsystem of tax-farming in Fatimid and Ayyubid times, as we are able\nto know it through the Cairo Geniza documents, was somewhat dif-\nferent. Although pernicious in more than one way, it fitted well into\nthe general framework of the economy and society of the Geniza\nperiod. Most of the damins belonged to the middle class, and, being\nthemselves merchants and industrialists, possessed knowledge and\nunderstanding of the problems they encountered while collecting\ntaxes.

There is further opportunity to refer to the\nMuslim judiciary while discussing the interplay of Jewish and Mus-\nlim laws. Here some incidental information provided by the Geniza\nis reviewed.\n\nThe most impressive aspect of Muslim juridical organization, as\nevidenced in our records, is its strict centralization. The lower courts\ninvestigated but were loath to decide matters before making sure of\nthe opinion of their superiors. A qadi in Qiis, a town near the south-\nern border of Egypt, wanted to have the tawqi‘ gadi ’l-qudat, the in-\nstructions of the chief qadi of Cairo, signed by him in a case of inheri-\ntance of middle-class Jews. For this purpose, the party concerned had\nto send a messenger to the capital, an expensive trip that required\nover two months of travel alone.! Even the powerful gadi of Alexan-\ndria decided about the disposal of the goods of a drowned silk mer-\nchant only after having received a tawqi ‘Gli, a rescript from the\ncaliph’s court.2 Two disputes that had come before the qadi of Jerusa-\nlem, one concerning the Jewish community of the city and another\nregarding a house shared by a Muslim and a Jewish notable in com-\nmon, were expected to be settled by the chief qadi of Ramle, then\nthe capital of Palestine. The tenor of the two letters dealing with\nthese cases shows that this was the regular course of action.® The fol-\nlowing incident is particularly characteristic. A prominent merchant,\nwho had dealings with many others, was found drowned. Before his\ndeath he had acknowledged in the Jewish high court that he owed\n400 dinars to the writer of the letter telling us about the occurrence.\nThe writer wished now that the witnesses testifying to the dead man’s\navowal should be heard by the qadi who dealt with the latter’s assets\nand liabilities. This appears to be merely a matter of procedure. Still,\na rescript by the sovereign (al-Malik al-Afdal) was needed for the\naction, and the writer most emphatically asks the addressee to secure\nfor him the desired document.t A similar system of procedure was in\nvogue in the Jewish juridical organization of those days. Instead of\ndeciding a case and then allowing for an appeal, the lower courts de-\nferred their judgments until they received proper instructions and\nbacking from the central authorities.\n\nThis weakness of the lower courts had a twofold corollary.

This mode of trying to influence the judges is re-\nflected in our records far more frequently than outright bribery (per-\nhaps because the latter did not require expression in writing). Bribes\nto the higher judiciary, such as the qadi who had his seat “in the\nPalace,” were not paid directly, but to a go-between and were a heavy\nimposition on the parties.® Lower judges were content with as little\nas 10 dirhems, very likely a kind of fixed fee known to every one.”\nMiddle Easterners familiar with practices that still prevailed during\nthe first half of the twentieth century will find nothing strange in\nsuch arrangements.\n\nA qadi in a big city like Alexandria had doorkeepers and a body-\nguard of armed slaves whom he would also send to apprehend persons\nagainst whom charges were made.#8 Otherwise, however, his executive\npower was limited.

The father\nof Saladin’s chief justice held such a double appointment in Ascalon,\nthen the main port in southern Palestine.'? The Geniza, in addition\nto the case of the qadi of Damietta just mentioned, tells the same of\nhis contemporary, al-Makin, the chiel judge of Alexandria, who died\nin 1134 after serving in office for many years.® No wonder, then, that\nwe often find in the Geniza qadis as shipowners, especially those of\nthe Lebanese ports Tyre and Tripoli, owners not only of coastal\ncraft, but of the largest ships plying the Mediterranean during the\neleventh century, each carrying five hundred passengers. In pre-\nIslamic times, the head of the Christian church in Alexandria, the\npatriarch, played a similar economic role.!* It may be that such com-\nbinations of religious and legal authority and economic power repre-\nsented an old tradition going back perhaps to the ancient Phoenicians\nand Carthaginians.\n\nThe Alexandrian judge al-Makin, who, by the way, was the one\nwhose protection was sought by the uneasy traveler from France re-\nferred to above, had his finger also in another pie. In addition to his\nsubstantial duties as judge about which we read repeatedly in the\nGeniza records, he was mushirif, or controller of the office of revenue.\nAs such he was approached by a representative of the Nagid, or Head\nof the Jews, with a request to free one-quarter of his crops, which he\nneeded for his household. (Normally, no one was permitted to make\nuse of the products of his fields before his accounts with the govern-\nment’s director of revenue were settled.)18\n\nMost frequently we find qadis engaged in mercantile undertakings\nand, in particular, as proprietors of a dar wakala, a combination of\nstorchouse and bourse (sce Med.

At the lower level, he acts as a notary making out legal\ndocuments, or as puisne judge, who settles minor business such as the\napproval of the appointment of an attorney.!® On the higher level,\nhe is a very influential legal expert whose opinion is sought, for in-\nstance, with regard to the amount of the poll tax, and who, in a meet-\ning with other jurists, may take precedence even over the qadi (in\nAlexandrial).!® Faqihs are repeatedly mentioned as belonging to the\nentourage of the rulers and as traveling in their company.2?\n\nThe term “mufti” for a Muslim jurisconsult, so common in Mam-\nlak times, is surprisingly rare in the records of the classical Geniza\nperiod, although the word “fatwi,” legal opinion, and its derivatives\nare frequently used, and even a Jewish dignitary is referred to with\nthe title “mufti.”?1\n\nOne of the most characteristic institutions of Muslim legal pro-\ncedure was that of the officially certified witnesses of good reputation,\nthe ‘udil, or “the just,” as they were called for short. Originally such\ncertificates were issued so that a testimony could not be contested\nbecause of alleged blemishes adhering to the witness’ character. By\nthe fourth century of Islam, these ‘udiil had become a fixed institu-\ntion, serving as assessors witnessing the court procedures, as well as\nnotaries. In the Geniza, the two meanings of the term, the original\nand the institutional, are equally alive. A Hebrew “Scroll,” or poetical\nstory, praised the caliph al-Hakim, among other things for appoint-\ning as night watchmen only “faithful witnesses” (Isaiah 8:2), that is,\n‘udil, or persons of certified good reputation.22 On the other hand,\nin the descriptions of the session of a Muslim court in Alexandria,\n1143, the judge is assisted by two “just witnesses” and by the scribes\nof the government office in which the session was held, and we meet\n\nGoitein, S.

When Jews make a contract before “four\njust witnesses,” the reference is to a Muslim notary and his assist-\nants.2¢ The facts attested to in such a way were usually accepted by a\nJewish court as true, although complaints or reports that the ‘udal\ngave false witness are not lacking.?®\n\nTurning now to the security forces, some notes about terminology\nare unavoidable. The classical word for police, shurta, is almost ab-\nsent from the Geniza records. It was retained as designation for the\noffice and guardhouse of the police in Old Cairo. The honorary title\nsahib al-shurta, “head of the police,” was borne by a number of Span-\nish Jewish notables, but was unknown in the East. As name of an\noffice it is extremely rare.26 Both expressions were relics from more\nancient times. With that craving for euphemistic terms so character-\nistic of this period, the police building, although containing grue-\nsome prisons, was called ma‘iina, “help,” while the security forces\nthemselves were divided into a number of specialized groups.2”\n\nThe head of the police was called wali, literally, “governor,” but\nits occurrence in numerous Geniza records leaves no doubt about the\nmeaning of their use of the term.28 The wali is found in big cities like\nCairo and Alexandria, in provincial towns, and even in a mere vil-\nlage.?® In cities like Alexandria, Ramle, or Jerusalem, as a rule, the\ngovernment was represented by an amir; in smaller places the wali\nwas also the head of the civil government. Therefore, in view of that\ndichotomy of judiciary and executive power, whenever one had a law-\nsuit or was in any other predicament that could lead to an interven-\ntion of the authorities, one applied to both the wili and the qadi, or,\nif the person concerned was of lower social standing, he would ask a\nfriend to ask another friend, still higher up, to approach the two for\nhim.30 A fine paid by a community was collected both by the wali and\nthe nd'ib, or “deputy” (as a judge other than the chief qadi was\ncalled). The former took five hundred silver dirhems as a “requisi-\ntion,” the latter two hundred, characterized in the document con-\ncerned as “bribe.” For those who paid these amounts, it presumably\nmade little difference what the items were called.3!\n\nOne tried to be on good terms with the custodian of order. When\na new wili was appointed in a townlet of the Rif, a fruiterer living\nthere was alerted by his brother in the capital that the new wili was a\nrelative of his predecessor and prepared to carry on his vendettas. It\nwould be good if “a gift of honor would reach him soon.” In a de-\ntailed description of a brawl in a small town the attacking party is\naccused by the other of having arranged matters with the wali before-\n\nGoitein, S.

The undaunted\nhost induced his friend, the chief of police, to send a message to the\ndistinguished visitor, however, whereupon the poet accepted the in-\nvitation. Whether this behind-the-scenes report is true, or represents\nonly the gossip of Alexandria in fall, 1140, is hard to say. In any case,\nthe poet did well to heed the wali, for when he returned to that city\nin spring, 1141, he experienced a quite unpleasant encounter with\nthe police.33\n\nAnother very important security officer was the multasib, or super-\nintendent of the market. His duties were manifold and ranged from\nthe supervision of commerce and industry to enforcement of the re-\nligious law (which partly concerned the non-Muslims as well) and\nthe infliction of corporal punishment. Detailed books on this inter-\nesting office began to be published toward the end of the twelfth\ncentury. Since a letter from Alexandria, written around 1140, says:\n“Everyone in the city behaves as if he were a muhtasib set over us,”\nit must have been common by that time. Still, it should be empha-\nsized that, with one important exception (a case from the thirteenth\ncentury), discussed below, the writers of the Geniza records are very\nreticent with regard to this office, all the more remarkable, since most\nof them deal with economic and legal matters and thus had good\nreason to make mention of the muhtasib, if his presence made itself\nfelt in the bazaars. The dearth of material in the Geniza records with\nregard to the multasib is matched by the same scarcity in the literary\nsources of the Fatimid period. One later historian states indeed that\nin Fatimid times, the office was often united in one person with that\nof the chief of police. Thus it seems that the prominence of the\nmultasib under the Ayyubid and subsequent regimes was due to\nMesopotamian influence on Egypt and Syria.

The document of 1247 notes also that he had\nlived in a house belonging to the Jewish community (and had left\nwithout paying rent). All this points to the fact that, despite his title,\nhis rank was rather low. Naturally, everyone tried to be on good\nterms with him. In one document we find “the supervisors of the\nquarters” acting as a kind of advisory council to the superintendent\nof the market (see below).37\n\nThe police force itself consisted of different contingents. The one\nmost frequently mentioned is the patrolmen, the all-purpose police.\nWe find them under the command of the police inspectors, or carry-\ning out orders given by qadis, customs officers, collectors of the poll\ntax, and the director of the mint. In the last case, they were accom-\npanied by mounted police, because in order to search for counterfeit\nmoney, they were required to encircle a complete neighborhood. In\ntwo instances, the patrolmen appear in groups of five.38\n\nAnother common member of the security force was the raqqas,\n“runner.” In modern Arabic the word means “dancer,” but in the\nGeniza period it designated an unskilled laborer and an errand boy\nfor any government office, especially one who had the task of sum-\nmoning or arresting a person. In one document, the “runners” are\nidentified with the patrolmen. Normally they were attached to the\nwali, or head of the police.3?\n\nThe executive arm of the poll tax office was the hushshar, “ral-\nliers,” who summoned the non-Muslims to the offices where they had\nto pay their taxes. The hushshar are often referred to, and it is evi-\ndent that they were not concerned with the actual collection of the\ntaxes, but formed a kind of auxiliary police whose task it was to let\nno one escape from fulfilling his duty.#®\n\nThe royal mint was protected by a guard. Elsewhere in the Geniza\nthe term for guard is used for combat soldier. Thus this vital institu-\ntion was obviously protected by members of the regular army.41\n\nOf particular interest is an armed force, called ahdath, “young\nmen,” mentioned in the Geniza with regard to Jerusalem and Aleppo,\nand perhaps also to Sfax, Tunisia. From three letters sent from\nJerusalem around 1040, it is evident that the Jewish inhabitants of\nthat city paid a special contribution toward the upkeep of this mili-\ntia, Most probably the same was done by the Christians.

After nightfall, the governor sent guards, for whom 5 dinars\nper day had to be paid (the confinement was lifted after twenty-four\nhours).18 In most cases the term designates a warrant sent to anyone\nwho owed a tax to the government or a debt to a private person,\nwhereupon he had to pay a certain sum for each day on which he\n“remained under tarsim.” Thus a physician in Alexandria, whose\nbrother, also a physician, had traveled to Old Cairo without having\npaid his poll tax (or having forgotten to send the receipts back), was\nput under tarsim until he would pay the poll tax for that brother.\nAfter two days of refusing to do so, he was confined to prison. One\nday and one night there taught him better and he paid.*” We read\nabout another person remaining ten days under tarsim, a third losing\nthe considerable sum of 13 dinars in this way, and a fourth who was\nfreed from it only after a change in the government.® In order to\nobtain such a warrant against his debtors, a merchant needed the\nintervention of the representative of the merchants in the capital.4?\n\nImprisonment in those days did not mean simply denial of free-\ndom. It was a far more cruel punishment. First, the prisoner was in\ndanger of dying from starvation in the event no one looked after him.\nFor the prison authorities did not feel themselves obliged to feed\nhim. Thus, a poor woman whose husband was in prison because he\nwas unable to pay the poll tax, asks in a letter for bread which she\nneeded to bring to him.?® A Muslim convert to Christianity who was\nthrown into prison was on the point of dying because his family re-\nfused to take care of him.

If the prisoner defaulted or was unable to pay,\nhe was cruelly maltreated. “I am afraid to leave my hiding, lest the\npoll tax collector finds me and puts me into prison, where I shall die,\nsince I possess nothing with which to save my soul,” writes a man\nwho had lost everything when all his goods were jettisoned from the\nship in which he traveled.

NON-MUSLIM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\n\nAfter having mustered the ranks of Muslim government and ad-\nministration as they were eyed by the Geniza people, it remains to\nascertain how the representatives of the non-Muslims, the Geniza\npeople themselves, fit into that general frame.\n\nIt has often been emphasized that the Fatimid period was the\ngolden age of government officials coming from the minorities. The\nsame was true for the subsequent Ayyubid period.! The “government\nservants,” together with the judges, who also have to be regarded to\nsome extent as government officials, formed the cream of Jewish\nsociety.2 Both in number and power the Christian government ser-\nvants far outstripped the Jewish—a fact [ully evidenced in the Geniza\nrecerds. Still, Jews frequently attained positions of powerful influ-\nence, as illustrated in the following often quoted verses of a malicious\nEgyptian poet:\n\nThe Jews of our time have attained the goal of their aspirations:\n\n‘The honors are theirs and so are the riches. Counsellors and kings\nare taken from their midst.\n\nEgyptians! I advise you, become Jews, for Heaven itself has turned\nJewish.?\n\nThe last verse contains a pun. Venus and Jupiter, the propitious\nstars, were both called sa‘d, “good fortune,” and Aba Sa‘d, we re-\nmember, was the name of that powerful Jewish courtier who met a\nviolent death in November, 1047,\n\nWe should view this preponderance of non-Muslims in govern-\nment service in its proper historical perspective. Office may have\ngiven power and wealth to some, but it did not grant precedence over\nthe members of the ruling religion. A ceremonial of the Fatimid\ncourt from the year 1122 shows that at a reception of the caliph all\nthe Muslim officials and even the notables of Old and New Cairo\ncame first, while the end of the long procession was formed by the\npatriarch with the Christian officials and the Jewish officials led by\n“the head of the Jews” (the Nagid).*\n\nIt seems to me that the generous admission of non-Muslims to gov-\nernment service in the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods and the violent\nopposition to them and their actual ousting in later times is 1o be\nattributed not only to a change from a more tolerant to a fanatical\nreligious atmosphere, but to a large extent also to socioeconomic\nconditions in general.

Why, then, did they leave the field of government service so much\nto the latter? Obviously because in the free economy prevailing at\nthat time business and industry offered more lucrative and less dan-\ngerous opportunities than the often humiliating and mostly precari-\nous service of the sultans. We have indeed seen that big business was\nlargely in Muslim hands. From the thirteenth century on, however,\nwhen the economy became increasingly monopolized by the state, the\nclamoring Muslim candidates for government posts became ever\nstronger, and the members of the minority groups had to give way.\nFanatical religious propaganda then formed an effective superstruc-\nture for this socioeconomic pressure.\n\nIn short, it was the unattractiveness of government service which\nmade it available to non-Muslims at a time when plenty of other\noutlets for economic activity were open to Muslims. This explains\nwhy the mints in most Muslim states remained largely a domain of\nthe Jews even in later periods. Daily work with hot melted metals in\na hot climate must have been extremely unpleasant under the primi-\ntive working conditions of those days—and just good enough for\nJews. In addition, no other branch of government work was so ex-\nposed to the temptation of fraud and embezzlement as the manufac-\nture of coins. Jews, the least protected minority, were by their very\nstatus the most faithful servants of the state, for they knew only too\nwell that in case of discovery of any impropriety no one would shield\nthem from punishment.\n\nFinally, we have to keep in mind that Muslim writers often exag-\ngerated grossly in speaking about the non-Muslims’ share in govern-\nment. The verses quoted are one case in point. As late as the forties\nof the thirteenth century a visitor to Egypt from the Muslim West\nreports that most of the Christians and Jews in that country were\nofficials working in the revenue offices and physicians.® As far as the\nJews are concerned, the Geniza enables us to check that statement.\nThe medical profession did indeed form an unproportionately large\nsection of the community.

We should not take such remarks too\nliterally, although it is generally true that in the Fatimid and Ayyubid\nperiods the non-Muslim minorities were conspicuous among the ser-\nvants of the state.\n\nTrying now to specify the various branches of administration in\nwhich persons represented in the Geniza were active, we are up\nagainst our imperlect knowledge of the nomenclature and admini-\nstrative practice of those times—and this despite the rich literature\nabout the subject produced by the Muslims. Thus we find in Cairo\nin December, 1236, a highly praised Kohen, bearing the title Nafis\nal-Dawla, “Priceless [Servant] of the Government,” and described as\nthe deputy of a qadi. Now it goes without saying that a Jew could\nnot become a deputy judge in Islam. Thus we must assume that that\nqadi, in addition to or instead of his substantial duties, headed a\ngovernment department where the Nafis, as he is referred to for short\nin other Geniza documents, acted as his substitute.”\n\nAround 1140, a person bearing the title ‘Amid al-Dawla, “Support\nof the Government,” was in charge of a dar wakala, a warehouse and\nbourse, and the same is reported for the year 1203 with regard to one\nAmin alDawla, “Trusted [Servant] of the Government.”® This\ncould mean that these persons were public servants who used their\nhigh position for running a profitable dar wakala; or such a dar\nwakala itself was a semiofficial institution, as is indeed suggested by\nsome Islamic sources.® Only in exceptional cases is the department\nover which an official presided expressly stated, as when a calligraphic\npersonal letter is addressed to the tax office, or when a sahib dar\nal-tiraz, head of the government embroidery workshop in Damietta,\ncalled Jalal al-Dawla, “Splendor of the Government,” receives a loan\nof 50 dinars in a document from the thirteenth century, unfortu-\nnately undated.’® As a rule, the Katibs are referred to by their names\nand titles, not by the office they held, which was known to all con-\ncerned.\n\nThe uppermost stratum of officialdom was formed by the courtiers\nwho had direct access to the caliphs and sultans, or, where these did\nnot exercise the highest power, to the actual rulers, whatever titles\nthey chose to bear. To this group belonged above all the court phy-\nsicians, about whom we hear so much in the Geniza, and some of\nwhom, such as the Nagids Mevorakh and Samuel b.

A Jew called Ibn\nAbi 'I-Dimm, “The Son of the One Whose Pet Was a Cat,” was head\nof the chancellery of the caliph al-Amir (1101-1130). Despite the rar-\nity of the name and the chronological coincidence it is doubtful that\nhe was identical with a physician bearing the same name in a Geniza\ndocument.!! The famous Abii Sa‘d was vizier to the mother of the\ncaliph al-Mustansir who ruled for her minor son, wherefore he, and\nnot the vizier of the caliph, exercised the highest power in the state.\nThe Geniza, as remarked before, calls him simply viceroy.!? Of a\nsimilar type was the man who claimed to be the administrator of\nal-Malik al-Afdal’s fabulous treasures and possessions. In order to be\nable to hold high office, however, Jews as a rule had to convert to\nIslam, as proved by the examples of Jacob Ibn Killis and of Aba\nSa‘d’s own son, who was given an important position after his father’s\nassassination but attained the vizierate only aiter his conversion.!3\n\nA less conspicuous but still important position was occupied by\nthose officials who controlled the revenue of the state in one capacity\nor another. Throughout, the Geniza refers to two different types of\nsuch officials, sometimes confused in the literary sources: the\nmushirif or mushrif, controller of revenue, and the ‘amil, director of\nthe revenue office. The two acting together, with the musharif men-\ntioned first, fixed the amount of the yearly payments to be made to\nthe government by tax-farmers.!* The control of the revenue of a\nlarge district such as that of Alexandria was a powerful position. We\nhave learned from a Geniza letter that it was once held by the famous\nqadi al-Makin, and a literary source shows that even a former vizier\ndid not regard it beneath his dignity to occupy it.?* Abu ’l-Munajja,\nthe Jew, the digger of the canal named after him, was musharif of\nthe equally rich Damietta province.’¢ In one Geniza letter a person\nboasts of having received by a rescript from the caliph ishraf al-Rif\nthe control of the Egyptian countryside, which makes him so bold\nthat he defies the orders of the Nagid. No doubt, the appointment\nreferred only to a certain district.”\n\nAs in the case of “katib,” the term “musharif” was applied to the\ncontroller of both a whole province and a little village. Therefore\nwe are not astonished to find that such a post was sought even for a\nyoung good-for-nothing aged twenty-two years. In some places, the\nsynonymous term ndzir, “overseer,” was used instead of “musharif.”\nA striking description of the doings in a revenue office in the capital\nwith its host of officials from the minority groups is contained in the\nletter translated in Mediterranean People.18\n\nGoitein, S.

We remember\nthat even a tax-farmer had this right.1?\n\nThe duties and authority of an ‘amil, director of revenue, are illus-\ntrated by the following instances. In Jerusalem around 1060 that\npost was occupied by a Karaite Jew, which, by the way, may partly\nexplain the powerful position of that sect in the Holy City. When he\nwas replaced by a Christian, we read in a letter sent from Jerusalem\nto a notable in Old Cairo: “I learned today that Ben ‘Alliin [the\nKaraite] was dismissed {rom his post of 'amil of Jerusalem ... and\nthat Ben Ma‘mar, the Christian, has been appointed. If it seems right\nto you, please approach ‘the prince of the community’ [a court phy-\nsician] who should obtain a letter from X. [a high dignitary] to Ben\nMa'mar advising him to be considerate toward our coreligionists\nwith regard to taxes and other matters.” This shows that an @mil had\na say not only in fixing the amount of taxes, but “in other matters” as\nwell. To be sure, the word should never be translated as “governor.”\nThe governor of Jerusalem was an “amir.” 20\n\nOn the other hand, we find ‘amils in small towns of Egypt where\nthey were befriended by the Tunisian merchants who went there to\nbuy flax. For flax, the staple crop of Egypt those days, was a govern-\nment preserve and could not be bought except with a permit from\nthe local ‘amil.2! Again, like the musharif, the director of revenue of\na whole province was also called “ ‘amil,” as was the one in charge of\nthe Buhayra district to whom the young good-for-nothing referred to\nabove (through the intercession of his grandmother, the widow of\nanother ‘amil) applied for a post. Finally, of course, the director of\nrevenue dealt also with the collection of the poll tax, whereas in a\nbig city, like Alexandria, this branch of revenue was in the hands of\na special ‘amil. In an account of expenditure from the eleventh cen-\ntury a significant item is called: gift to the attendants of the director\nof revenue.?2\n\nA more comprehensive designation that comprised the two offices\njust discussed, as well as the customs stations, was the sahib al-diwan,\n“director of the government office.” He is mentioned as fixing the\namount of rents to be paid for houses owed by the government or\nthe amount of the purchase tax for mules and camels. Even a private\nperson who had farmed out the revenue from a customs house was\naddressed in this way.23\n\nThe monetary system of that time necessitated a host of money\nchangers, bankers, and accountants to cope with the collection of the\ntaxes and the accounting of expenditures.

These full- or part-time servants of the government\nare discussed in Med. Soc., 1, 248-250.\n\nSince the Jews were avid travelers, it is not surprising that some of\nthem occupied government posts connected with seafaring. We find\nJews as superintendents of the ports of Alexandria, Egypt, and of\nDenia, Spain, and as “coatrollers” of ships, who were in charge of\nthe passengers and their goods. Like other government officials, the\nlatter were permitted to do business on their own account while on\ntravel and could not be sued during the time they were actually in\nservice. On the other hand, merchants were reluctant to make use of\nthem as agents, precisely because of their connection with the gov-\nernment.??\n\nAlthough it may seem odd at first, the Geniza proves that Jews\nserved as police. Persons working in the shurta (the guardhouse of\nOld Cairo) or as a hdshir, “rallier,” or as nightwatchmen, or as mem-\nbers of the secret police appear in our documents at different times.\nJews are repeatedly called raqqas, “runner,” which had various mean-\nings. But when, in an argument, a person threatens to become a\nraqqas, it is most likely that he meant enlisting in the auxiliary\npolice. Since the “ralliers,” “runners,” and plainclothesmen assisted\nthe authorities in the collection of taxes and customs dues, the sur-\nveillance of minority groups was facilitated by employing for these\ntasks persons from their own midst.26\n\nThe army was composed of foreign contingents, such as Berbers,\nTurks, Negroes, and some Bedouin levies, and, as a rule, did not\nadmit members of the local sedentary population, whether non-Mus-\nlim or Muslim. In two letters from Alexandria, when a desperate\nfather asks his friends in Old Cairo to help him find his son who had\nrun away to the army, we may safely assume that the young man\nexpected to be employed as purveyor or clerk, not as a soldier. For\nhe carried with him goods, and the unhappy father did not preclude\nthe possibility that the adventurous youth had traveled as far as\nYemen.?? A kdtib al-‘arab, chief clerk of a contingent of Bedouins, is\ndescribed in one letter as a particularly influential and reliable per-\nson, and a Karaite family, famous for its copyists of Hebrew books,\nhad as patronymic the same appellation, proving that such an ap-\npointment was regarded as a distinction.28\n\nGoitein, S.

A physician of the navy (or rather of the battleship,\nustil) has left us his accounts for the year 1139.30 Abi Zikri, the elder\nson of the judge Elijah b. Zechariah, so often mentioned in the Gen-\niza, served around 1220 in the army of the Ayyubid prince al-\nMu‘azzam. He must have been quite influential, since in one letter\nhe promised to procure for his old father a pension from the sultan\nal-Kamil; still, he could not get away from the army whenever he\nwished.3! A similar and far stronger complaint is made by another\narmy doctor who had first to cure a Mamluk who resided on his fief\nin an out-of-the-way Egyptian village and then to report back to his\namir and supervise his taking medicine, with the result that he was\nunable to attend the confinement of his own wife.32 Of particular\ninterest is a long letter to an important physician who was away with\nthe army while his son-in-law, the writer of the letter, collected his\nsalary, which was obviously paid in the capital. He reports on the\nmanifold affairs regarding which the old man had written to him and\nto his friends.

The provisions\nof ancient Islamic law which exempted the indigent, the invalids,\nand the old were no longer observed in the Geniza period and had\nalso been discarded in theory by the Shafi‘i school of law that pre-\nvailed in Egypt. It is precisely persons of such descriptions about\nwhose plight we read so much in our records. The payment of the\npoll tax was item number one in the budget of families with modest\nincome, such as teachers or laborers. For a man could clothe himself\ninexpensively, he could eat at starvation level, as perhaps a very large\nsection of the population did. But he could not escape the tax-gath-\nerer—at least not for long.

A schoolmaster from Qalyiib, a\nsmall town north of Cairo, who also earned some money by copying\nbooks, complains to a relative in the capital around 1225: “This place\ndoces not provide me with the poll tax or clothing, and, as to {ood, the\nfees suffice only for me alone. For they amount only to 5 dirhems a\nweek and I nced three-quarters of a dirhem a day at least. Thus my\nincome is not enough even for having a robe laundered. . . . The\nNagid promised me a year ago that he would take care of the jaliya.\nBut the year has passed and I have not received anything from him,\n1 am now perplexed and pondering where to turn and where to\nflee.” He sends four books copied by himself, hoping, somewhat\nfaintly, that the proceeds would resolve his predicament.

In a letter addressed to Moses Maimonides\na person is accused of having neglected his duties as pater familias,\nsince he had never paid the poll tax and school fees (in this sequencel)\nfor his two boys, one of whom was seventeen and the other thirteen\nat the time of the complaint.” From a document written around 1095\nit seems that the jaliya was due from the age of nine.?\n\nWhether death canceled arrears in poll tax due was a moot point\namong Muslim doctors of law. In the Geniza period it went without\nsaying that it had to be borne by the legal heirs.

In a similar case, where a brother had disappeared in\nSyria, the demand was contested (whether successfully, we do not\nknow), because, during his absence, the traveler had not charged his\nbrother with the payment of his poll tax.13 In a letter from Alexan-\ndria, a brother away in India is politely reminded to send something\nfor his jaliya, since his father was spending money for this purpose all\nthe time.24 At his arrival in Alexandria after an absence of four years\n\nGoitein, S.

In a smaller locality when the taxgatherer had not ar-\nrived in time, no one could set out on a journcy, since it was danger-\nous to do so without a bard’a. A scholar from Ascalon, Palestine,\nwriting a letter of recommendation for a colleague from Damascus\nwho traveled to Egypt emphasizes that the latter was in possession of\na certificate issued by the poll tax office (and not merely by an indi-\nvidual tax-gatherer). Even so he asks the addressee to see to it that the\nEgyptian authorities should not “interpret” the certificate in a way\nthat would enable them to squeeze an additional amount from his\nfriend.1¢ It was a common occurrence that Nile boats were not al-\nlowed to depart or were even turned back by the police because one\nof the passengers was unable to produce his jaliya receipt.!?\n\nSince everyone paid where he was registered as resident, one would\nexpect that a traveler would not be held liable to contribute to the\njaliya of the locality where he sojourned temporarily.

The letter regarding the\nscholar from Damascus just mentioned, as well as the stories of the\nmerchants from Sicily and Tunisia sketched earlier, are cases in\npoint.18 Even while setting out from one town of Egypt to another,\na traveler would provide himself with a letter of recommendation to\nan influential personality asking him for protection against over-\nreaching tax collectors. A letter written in Arabic characters to a\nnotable in Fustat by his brother traveling in the Rif contains this\nstory: The mugaddam of the little town of Damira paid his poll tax\nin the provincial capital al-Mahalla. While staying in Fustat for a\nyear he paid there as nonresident and received a proper Bara’a. When\nhe returned to Damira, however, the authorities did not honor the\nreceipt and asked him to pay a second time.

There are many in this city who have arrived\nprior to myself, but were not treated the way I experienced. Every day they\nmolest me and summon me to the court, asking me to pay the jaliya in full.\nThey want to register me as a resident, whereas my father, as you know, was\nonly a “newcomer.” What they impose on me, is remitted to others, who do\nnot allow themselves to be molested—you know whom I mean. The benefit\nwhich I derived from your intervention for me is that I have to pay this\nyear almost 2 dinars. I would not have minded, if others had been treated\nin the same way. The tax-gatherers (hushshar, “ralliers”) and the director of\nthe jaliya are not to be blamed; all this is entirely the work of the jews!\n\nThe role of the local communities in the collection of the poll tax is\ndiscussed presently.1?\n\nWhen did a person cease to be a newcomer, {ari’, and obtain the\nstatus of a permanent resident, gatin? Owing to the astonishing mo-\nbility of the Mediterranean middle class of those days, this question\ncaused many headaches both to the administration and to the persons\naffected. As we have already seen in the example of the Egyptian\nmerchant who was immobilized by illness in Constantinople, much\ndepended on the goodwill of the individual official (and the amount\nof the bribe offered to him). In general, however, it appears from the\nGeniza records hat it was not casy to change one’s status. An ele-\nventh-century Tunisian merchant and scholar who, after having\nlived in Egypt for years, spent some time later on in Byzantium and\nfinally settled in the Holy Land, writes: “I intend to pass the winter\nin Jerusalem, for I have learned about the [bad] Nile {which meant\nfamine for Egypt to where the writer expected to travel]. Further-\nmore, I am registered in the revenue office (khardj) of Old Cairo as\nresident. Originally they registered me as a newcomer, but when my\nstay in the country extended, I became a gdtin. By now, I have been\naway from Egypt for ten years and this is my eleventh.” Since the\nwriter wished to pay the poll tax incumbent on a resident where he\nactually lived, namely in Palestine, he preferred not to return to\nEgypt, where he still was registered as such.20\n\nBecause of the large number of Syro-Palestinians living all over\nEgypt, a special office was created for them in the capital, where they\nhad to appear every year in person for the payment of their jaliya.\nThe occurrences described in Med.

No direct reference to the “Syro-Pales-\ntinian jaliya” has been found thus far in the Geniza with regard to\nthe Fatimid period.2!\n\nWere there any exemptions from the duty to pay the poll tax? The\nancient idea that those who dedicate themselves to the service of God\nshould be free from the service of men was realized in the Jewish\ncommunity by its bearing of the tax burden for its scholarly officials.\nIt was an internal arrangement. The Muslim authorities had nothing\nto do with it. There are, however, two reports in the Geniza, from\nthe eleventh and the twelfth centuries, respectively, claiming that\ncertain Jews in Baghdad were granted exemption from the poll tax.\nIt is stated in one that they should not publicize this special favor;\nin the other, that the ben'eficiaries themselves declined to accept it,\nbecause the tax protected their life and property (as is indeed the\nofficial Muslim theory). Those reports are semilegendary and al-\nthough they may contain a grain of truth, lack the details to make\nthem significant =2\n\nA few cases of exemption from the poll tax occur in Geniza letters\nrelated to Egypt. A distinguished traveler from France acknowledges\ngratefully his having been freed from the zimiya, a term he explained\nby a Hebrew word for capitation, as well as from other impositions,\nby a special rescript of the viceroy (al-Malik al-Afdal).28 A man who\nhad lost his riches and served as a minor community official earning\n1-14 dirhems a dav (“which is really not a salary”) informs the Nagid\nSamuel (1140-1159) of his intention to settle definitely in a village\nnear Minyat Zifta belonging to one Nasir al-Din, whose inhabitants\ndid not pay the jaliya. Another destitute person writes that he had\nbeen offered a government post in Alexandria, “where he would not\nbe held for the poll tax.” Whatever this expression may mean, the\nlast two cases do not represent a real exemption, but rather payment\nrendered in the form of a service, which, to be sure, was salvation for\npersons without cash.24\n\nThe strangest case of an exemption from the poll tax is that of the\npoet Yakhin, who had settled in al-Mahalla but fled from there when\nthe superintendent of revenue “harassed him” by demanding from\nhim the poll tax. The letter supposes that Yakhin was entitled to tax\nexemption because he was a Khaybari, a Jew from a north Arabian\nclan that asserted it had received special privileges from the Prophet\nof Islam.

        "text": "vii, G, 2 Poll Tax 387\n\nGranted by the Prophet.” References to persons called Ibn al-Khay-\nbari are found in various Geniza documents of the eleventh century.\nBut no express testimony that any tax collector did honor the Khay-\nbaris’ claim has turned up thus far. And it seems to me that a distinc-\ntion should be made between Jews who really emigrated from north\nArabia and were called Hijazis and the Khaybaris, who probably\ncame to the West via Iraq and had no real connection with their\nregion of origin, the oasis of Khaybar.2\n\nThe Geniza proves that the data given by the Muslim handbooks\nof administration on the amounts of the poll tax, although hardly\nreflecting the realities in full, are basically correct. Ibn Mammiti (a\nChristian convert to Islam, d. 1209) notes as the highest yearly rate\n4-1/6 dinars. This is exactly the sum paid by a physician according\nto a document dated 1182.26 As lowest grade he gives “1 plus 14 and\n14 dinars and 2 habbas,” that is, 1-54 dinars. We find this amount in\nthe Geniza repeatedly for Saladin’s time, but also 120 years earlier,\nwhen a Tunisian merchant in Old Cairo paid the poll tax for a\nJewish packer who worked in the flax-growing center of Busir, but\nwho as a foreigner most probably had to deliver his jiliya in the cap-\nital.2? According to the “Scroll” of the Norman proselyte Obadiah, in\nBaghdad, around 1100 the three classes of non-Muslims paid 1-14,\n2-v4, and 4-14 dinars, respectively.?8\n\nIn practice, these rates were adjusted in conformity with local\nconditions. A passage from a letter, written in Alexandria in May,\n1141, is instructive in this respect: “Rayhin [a freedman or slave of\nthe caliph or the vizier] promised the Jews and the Christians to ob-\ntain for them a properly ratified rescript vouching that the rates of\nthe jizya would remain as they are at present and that no one would\nhave the right to ask them for more. The rates should be the same as\nthose fixed by the qadi al-Makin [the well-known judge of Alexan-\ndria, who died in 1134).” 22 At approximately the same time there\nwere complaints about gross misuse and embezzlement of the pro-\nceeds of the poll tax in that city. In a later letter the same writer\nalludes to both, namely, the attempt to raise the rates and the mal-\npractices of its collection, when he says: “It was X. fan influential\npersonage-in Old Cairo] who saved the Jews from the jizya and the\nways of its collection.” 3¢\n\nIt seems to me that such adjustments represented not only in-\ncreases in the rates (as when the caliph al-Hikim doubled the poll\ntax for some time),3! but occasionally also alleviations made with\nregard to the poverty of the affected population.

        "text": "388 Muslim Government vii, G, 2\n\nincome, as proved by the Geniza for three centuries. It may well be\nthat the qadi al-Makin reduced the rates to some extent. When we\nfind that both foreigners and persons native in Egypt registered for\nthe jaliya not in the cities where they lived, but in smaller towns, we\nmay safely assume that this practice was advantageous, most prob-\nably because of lower rates. Unfortunately, it is not possible for the\ntime being to answer this question with the aid of the many details\nabout actual payments given in the Geniza records, for these amounts\nmay either include fines for arrears, or, on the contrary, represent\nonly installments.\n\nA few examples may suffice to illustrate this complex situation. A\nlocal Egyptian Jew, registered in a small town, who was momentarily\nout of cash, asks for a loan of 2 dinars for the payment of the current\nyear’s jaliya. As security he provides three books: a compendium of\nmedicine, valued at 50 silver dirhems, the Magamat of Hariri (a\nfamous work of Arabic belles lettres), worth 13 dirhems, and a book of\nrabbinical law, whose price is not indicated. He promises to return\nthe loan in a month’s time. The three books combined betray the\nwriter as an educated medical practitioner who would be expected\nto pay at least the rate for medium income, officially 2 dinars in\nEgypt. Thus we could assume that the amount of 2 dinars mentioned\nin the letter represents a reduced rate. The writer also remarks, how-\never, that most of the year had already passed, which means that\nhe had to pay arrears. Consequently, either the rate for medium in-\ncome in that little town was considerably below 2 dinars, or the\nphysician paid the jaliya for the poor, which is unlikely. Since the\nletter is from the late Ayyubid period, for which a flat rate of 2 dinars\nis attested in literary sources, this rate might have been in effect here,\ntoo. The same rate is found in two other Geniza documents from the\n1280's.32\n\nSimilarly, when a religious slaughterer paid 1-34 dinars around\n1180, it may represent either a substantially reduced medium rate or\na slighty raised minimum. Arrears could not be assumed in this case,\nbecause the person worked on the market and the accounts of his\npayments to the community for every week of the year have been\npreserved. Thus he could not escape the tax collectors.3?\n\nIn the financial report of a parnas, or social officer, in Old Cairo\nfor the last month of the Muslim year coinciding with April-May,\n1182, we find the following items: “jiliya for X: 13 dirhems, balance\nof the jaliya for Y: 11-14 dirhems.” Since we are here near the “clos-\ning of the accounts” (see below), it stands to reason that the first\n\nGoitein, S.

On the one hand we find many requests addressed to notables\nto use their influence on the tax officials with regard to a certain per-\nson or local community.3® On the other hand, one wonders whether\nso much hardship could have existed had the granting of alleviations\nbeen common practice.\n\nThere are repeated references to fines for arrears. These were ac-\ntually payments to the “ralliers” sent to summon the non-Muslims to\nthe tax office. A man who was 30 dirhems in arrears had to pay one\nsilver piece, fidda, every week. Another one writes that he gave the\nhushshar 4 dirhems at a time (perhaps four “ralliers” appeared to-\ngether). Moreover, his house was offered for sale by auction.37?\n\nThe extortion of payments of the poll tax in advance is thus far\nknown from Geniza records only for Palestine and for the second\nquarter of the eleventh century, a period of anarchy and misrule.\nAccording to one report, payment was asked a full five months before\nthe Muslim New Year on which it was due.s8\n\nIt has often been asserted that the jaliya was collected by the non-\nMuslim communities and their official heads. This assumption is\nrefuted by the evidence of the Geniza records which show that each\nindividual was contacted by the state authorities directly and had to\nfind the means for payment himself. A person lacking the required\ncash would sell or pawn his clothes or take from his wife's marriage\nportion, which he was not allowed to touch, or even appropriate\nmaterial given to her for processing, such as raw silk that she was\nsupposed to unravel3® If such supplementary sources were un-\navailable he would ask for an advance or a loan, and, if that was not\nforthcoming either, he would request of a person known for his\nmunificence to contribute something himself and to introduce him\nto others.40\n\nIn addition to the references given, three more examples illustrate\na subject so profusely represented in the Geniza records. A letter by\na Jewish judge from Old Cairo recommends to a physician and\nscholar living in the provincial town of al-Mahalla a young cantor,\nwhose father had pursued the same profession: “When the bearer\nof this letter learned that the time of the collection of the poll tax\nwas nearing, he sought rescue by traveling to the Rif [the countryside]\n\nGoitein, S.

He is a fine young man,\naspiring to noble goals, religious and devout and deserving of all the\ngood you will do for him.” A religious functionary in Bilbays, an-\nother provincial town, writes to his superior in Old Cairo: “What\nholds me back here is the hope to get the money for the poll tax for\nme and my son. Otherwise, I would have left the place, since one\ncannot really make a living here.” Despite the reference to his son,\nthe man must have been comparatively young, for he asks the ad-\ndressee’s permission to come to the capital to continue his studies\nwith him.

One letter remarks: “This week the people\nexperienced hardships because of the jiliya and we all were hiding\nin the houses.” 42 This means of escape had many drawbacks, though.\nFirst of all, as we. have scen, the fugitive’s male relatives were held\nresponsible for him. Second, he was unable to earn a livelihood,\nespecially if his income was derived from a workshop or a store. When\na person in such a predicament writes that his wife and children had\ndied of hunger because he was in hiding and unable to maintain\nthem, he meant it literally, not figuratively.

The total amount to be levied in one area,\nlike other items of the budget, was fixed in advance (otherwise it\ncould not be farmed out), and explains why the Jewish authorities\nwere so eager to register foreigners, who sojourned in a city even for\na short while, as residents.®> Moreover, although, in Egypt at least,\nthe Jewish local leaders were not held responsible for the total\namount of the poll tax to be raised—~we do not read even about\nthreats in this respect—they themselves regarded the payment of the\njaliya for the poor as a holy obligation and a pious deed comparable\nwith the highly meritorious ransoming of the captives. For the or-\nganization of this charity see above (chap. v, sec. C).\n\n1t is evident from many Geniza records that during long periods\nand in many places the assistance of the indigent taxpayer was not\nhandled by the community, but was left to the vagaries of private\nphilanthropy, as repeatedly illustrated. Conversely, there were times\nwhen a local non-Muslim community was charged with a global poll\ntax or, where its leaders saw themselves coerced, to take into their\nown hands a yearly collection, at least for a section of the commu-\nnity. When, owing to the dismal economic and security situation in\neleventh-century Jerusalem, the population fluctuated spasmodically,\na fixed sum was made mandatory on the Jewish community, and its\nleaders were held responsible for its payment, as we may conclude\nfrom desperate appeals for help to brethren in the Egyptian capital.\n“A heavy poll tax is imposed on us in a lump; but we are few, and\nunable to pay even a fraction of it. Every year we take loans {from\nMuslims] for interest so that the pilgrims to the Holy City should not\nbe molested with warrants of arrest for nonpayment of the tax.” 46\nOne letter from Jerusalem sent around 1040 is an appeal for a collec-\ntion toward the repayment of such a loan incurred by the community\ntogether with the arrears due from previous years.A7\n\nA somewhat similar but still different situation is reflected in\norders given by the Nagid Abraham Maimonides to his treasurer\n(and, by the way, written in his own hand): “Please pay immediately\neighty-one dirhems to the qadi Shams al-Din [the director of revenue\nin Old Cairo] in order to close the account for the balance of the\njaliya for the year 614.” The Muslim year in question ended on\nMarch 29, 1218, and the paper is dated April 22. “Send thirty-five\ndirhems to the illustrious elder The Trusted to be taken from the\n\nGoitein, S.

This assumption is corroborated by a third\norder of the Nagid, found in the same batch of papers (but written\nin Arabic characters) dealing with the ground rent paid for the poor\nliving inside the old Roman fortress of Fustat.18\n\nIn the orders just mentioned the department in charge of the poll\ntax is referred to in a general way as “the government office.” But it\nis evident from many records that this task was assigned to a group\nof special officials, one called ‘amil, who took care of the administra-\ntive side, while the technicalities accompanying cash payments were\nhandled by a government cashier, who was styled jahbadh al-jawali\ndown to the twclfth century, whereas later on the general designation\nfor banker or money changer, sayrafi, was used instead.*® In case of\nirregularities the chief of police and even the governor of a city were\napproached. This was done in Alexandria, around 1140, when the\n‘amil, with the connivance of the cashier, issued receipts to the tax-\npayers but left their names “open,” that is, as still owing the tax in\nthe government records in order to extort from them two payments,\none for the state treasurer and one to be pocketed by himself and his\naccomplices. As the document shows, the local authorities approached\nhad good intentions but their efforts were of no avail and an appeal\nwas lodged with the central government.50\n\nThe express testimony of the Geniza letters to the severe hardship\ncaused by the jaliya is confirmed by implicit evidence of the Arabic\npapyri. In his painstaking study quoted in note 1, A. Grohmann\ncomes to the conclusion that the numerous data about arrears and\ninstallments in the payment of the jaliya indicate the straitened cir-\ncumstances in which the large mass of taxpayers usually found itself.\n‘The papyri discussed by Grohmann refer to Christians.\n\nIn general it has to be emphasized that the subject of the poll tax\noccupies far more space in the Geniza records than one would antici-\npate.

Soc., volume I, chapters ii and iii.\nImpositions on special occasions are referred to in the Geniza records,\nbut as a rule we cannot make head or tail of them since the writers\npresuppose that the addressee has knowledge of the pertinent facts.\nThus, one letter describes most vividly a requisition, musadara, car-\nried out against a whole town, in which Muslims, Christians, Samari-\ntans, and Jews were all affected, with the latter suffering even more\nthan the other communities. All the clothing and the provisions of\nwheat and wine hoarded in the house of the writer's uncle were\nplundered; even the rope of the well was taken away. The authority\nordering the requisition is circumspectly referred to as the biblical\n“Haman the wicked” so that we are left in the dark as to his iden-\ntity.?! When, in a letter from Alexandria, dated October 21, 1219,\nwe read about a “voluntary contribution” of 6,000 dinars collected\nfrom “the people of the city,” the date makes it evident that it was\na war effort in connection with the attack of the Crusaders on Dam-\nietta, taken by them a few weeks later. “The people of Alexandria”\nmust mean the whole population, for a letter written about 1195\ntells about the share in a weekly tribute to be paid by the Jewish\ncommunity (milla, as called here) which, although amounting to\nonly 7 dinars, was regarded as a heavy burden on the decimated and\nimpoverished community.5?\n\nFinally, in war and peace alike there were occasions when the civil\npopulation was summoned to do corvée, enforced and unpaid labor\nfor the government or for whomsoever was in power. ‘*“The markets\nare closed and no one is to be seen in the streets, for anyone making\nan appearance is taken to digging trenches,” says one letter referring\nto a state of war in other passages.’3 Nowhere is there an allusion to\nthe special singling out of non-Muslim minorities for such duties. On\nthe contrary, a query addressed to Maimonides refers to a generally\naccepted custom that Jews were not forced “to dig trenches and to\npull down walls” on Sabbaths and holidays. This tallies with the\nreport of a German traveler who visited Cairo after Acre had been\ntaken by the Mamluks in 1291 and reports that the prisoners were\nforced to work on buildings, but the Jews were given freedom to\nobserve their Sabbath.5¢ It is natural that local people tried to de-\n\nGoitein, S.

A group of workmen who\nwere newcomers to a provincial town complain: “We were dragged\nto the corvées, beaten with sticks and told: you do the work for the\nsultan.” The same group asserts that the old-timers did not permit\nthem to exercise their crafls.5®\n\nBesides the corvée, common all over the Middle East to the be-\nginning of the twentieth century, the Geniza refers to another form\nof enforced labor about which we are less well informed: the man-\ndatory recruitment of skilled artisans for government workshops.\nThe plight of one such man is told in Med. Soc., I, 82. I suspect that\nthe many persons described as (government) employees without fur-\nther definition were craftsmen working for the government.58\n\nNext to the poll tax the appropriation of estates by the government\ncaused constant concern to the people speaking to us through the\nGeniza records. This aflliction was by no means confined to the re-\nligious minorities, as we know only too well from Muslim literature.\nBut the Christians and Jews had to fight to preserve the right to have\ntheir cases of inheritance treated according to their own law and\nbefore their own courts. Although practice varied widely in different\nplaces and times, it seems that during the Fatimid period this right\nwas generally recognized, although it had to be reinforced from time\nto time by caliphal rescripts. Al-Malik al-Afdal, whose reputedly\nbeneficial regime has been referred to so often in this book, was\ncredited with stopping the illegal appropriation of estates by the\ngovernment.5” While this applied to the population as a whole, the\nGeniza reveals that measures were taken under his reign to safeguard\nthe specific rights of non-Muslims as well. His court physician, the\nNagid Mevérikh, obtained from him an order reemphasizing the\nexclusive rights of Jewish authorities to deal with the estates of alien\nJews who had died in the country. When, after Mevorakly's death\nand in the wake of some dispute among the dead foreigner’s acquain-\ntances, the Alexandrian qadi’s Office of Estates appropriated the\nproperty left, recourse was immediately sought with the central gov-\nernment in the capital. On that occasion we hear that only a short\ntime before the Christians in Alexandria, as well as those in Upper\nLgypt, Tinnis, and Damietta, had received rescripts confirming that\nno government office was to interfere with estates of persons of their\ndenomination. This remark, written around 1115, proves that there\nhad been many such attempts and that each region had to fight\nseparately to have its rights reconfirmed.®® This question must be\nstudied in the general context of the interplay of laws and authorities\nto be observed in the Geniza records.\n\nGoitein, S.

The Interplay of Laws\n\nThe fight of the Christian and Jewish communities for the right\nto apply their own laws of inheritance had its good reasons. In certain\ncases, Muslim law gave the government opportunity to lay claims on\na part or all of the estate, and, in addition, opened the door for\narbitrary and unscrupulous practices. A few examples selected from\nthe relevant Geniza records illustrate the complex situation.\n\nAccording to Muslim law, a woman is worth half a man. Therefore,\na daughter can never inherit more than half her father’s estate. If no\nother heirs are extant the other half falls to the government. Accord-\ning to Jewish law, an only daughter inherited the entire estate of\nher father. No wonder the Muslim authorities were cager to apply\ntheir own law. In addition, they would not investigate too deeply\nwhether other heirs existed or whether the possessions left actually\nbelonged to the intestate or not. In view of all this, any interference\nby the Office of Estates was dreaded as harmful.\n\nIn 1058, an Egyptian Jewish merchant entrusted a business friend\nreturning to his native Sicily with a large consignment of Oriental\nspices, drugs, and other goods. The agent died on the high sea, and\nthe ship arrived in Tripoli, Libya, instead of Sicily. The Jewish au-\nthorities in Tripoli sequestered everything carried by the deceased\nin order to guard the rights of his widow and only daughter back\nin Sicily. The very fact that “the Jewish court and elders” were able\nto take possession of the goods of the foreigner proves that in those\ndays the right of the non-Muslim communities to deal with the\nestates of their coreligionists was still recognized in principle. The\nEgyptian merchant tried to get his shipment back, but the Jewish\nauthorities in Tripoli refused to return it except on the basis of a\nfull-fledged lawsuit between the merchant and the representatives\nof the widow and the orphan, a protracted affair. In order to protect\ntheir countryman, the rabbinical court in Old Cairo turned to the\nJewish high court in Jerusalem. The reasoning of the Cairene court\nwas the following: Any delay in the return of the goods of the Egyp-\ntian Jewish merchant might lead to their confiscation by the Muslim\ngovernment of Tripoli who would use the pretext either that they\nbelonged to a foreigner (and would not care to inquire whether they\nreally had been his property) or that the heir was a female (who had\nclaim on only half the estate of her father).

This happened to the\nestate of the freedman Bundar, about which a detailed, but much\nmutilated document has been preserved.? Around 1200, Maimonides\nmentions in one of his responsa as a well-known fact that the Office\nof Estates in the locality concerned used to confiscate one-half the\nproperty left when an only daughter was the heir.3\n\nA particularly interesting case, which illustrates also the interplay\nof government and communal jurisdiction, is described in a Geniza\ndocument dated 1231. A woman had left a daughter and a sister.\nAccording to Muslim law the former was entitled to one-half, the\nlatter to one-sixth, making a total of two-thirds of the estate. Ac-\ncordingly, the government appropriated one-third of a house the\ndead woman had possessed. In actuality, she had been the proprietor\nof two houses. During her lifetime, in order to restrict government\nseizure of her estate to the possible minimum, she had given her\nsister the other house as a gift. In the 1231 document, the sister\ndeclares in a Jewish court that she laid no claim on the estate han-\ndled by the government office, since she had received her share be-\nfore.t\n\nBy their very nature, most cases of succession are complicated.\nSince it was taken for granted that the government would appropri-\nate a part of the estate when there were only female heirs, and since\nthe Muslim authorities did not want to be bothered too much with\nthe intricacies of administrative practice superimposed on Jewish\nlaw, we read about agreements on flat sums between the two authori-\nties. According to Jewish law a widow was not an heir, but was\nentitled to an indemnity fixed in her marriage contract, which was\nregarded as a debt and, as such, had precedence over the claims of\nthe heirs. Some Geniza documents show that this principle was\nrecognized by the Office of Estates. In an agreement on a flat sum\nbetween the latter and “the elders of the {Jewish] community,” dated\n1203, the balance left to the survivors by the state was presumably\nthe share of the only daughter, which was approximately equal to\nthat of the state, and the widow’s indemnity, which was considerably\nhigher.?\n\nWe find private persons, too, engaged in high-handed practices\nagainst orphans.

As\nusual, the case was complicated. Their mother, who had no right to\ndo so, had sold those ruins to a Jew before they were taken by the\nMuslim. The very fact that the sisters, now grown up, expected to\nobtain their right shows that the Muslim state—we are in early\nAyyubid times—respected law when there was someone ready and\nable to fight for it.¢\n\nIt was not only in cases of females as sole heirs that the interference\nof the government Office of Estates was dreaded. It was the same\nwith male heirs, and even where there was no discrepancy at all\nbetween Jewish and Muslim law. An heir who informs his corres-\npondent that no one, the government included, had any claim on his\ninheritance, adds resignedly that, as his case stood, there was only the\nquestion whether the government would take one-half or three-\neighths.” An old man, who was supported by his nephew out of the\nestate of his late brother, lost this support when the nephew died\nand the family of the deceased was not prepared to continue the\nhelp. But the old man was afraid of invoking the help of the govern-\nment. When the heir was a son, a brother had no legal claims ac-\ncording to both Muslim and Jewish law. Still, it was assumed that, if\napproached, the Office of Estates would intervene and use the oppor-\ntunity to appropriate a lion's share of the remaining estate. The\nletter is addressed to the judge Elijah b. Zechariah, requesting him to\nsubmit the matter to the Nagid Abraham Maimonides for redress;\notherwise, it would finally reach the Muslim authorities.®8 Around\n1040, a merchant from Tunisia applies to the head of the Jewish\ncommunity in Old Cairo to look after the goods of a countryman of\nhis, on which the qadi of Tyre, Lebanon, had laid his hand. We have\nalready met that qadi as the proprictor of a large ship, a warehouse,\nand a bourse. Thus, it is not clear whether the man had acted in his\ncapacity as Muslim judge or as representative of the merchants.?\n\nThe confiscation by the state of the goods of a merchant who had\ndied in a foreign country was in itself a conflict of laws. According to\nthe concept that law was personal and not territorial, the very notion\nof a foreigner did not apply to the sphere of the law of personal\nstatus. All the local authorities had to do was to let the representa-\ntives of the denomination to which the dead man belonged deal with\nhis estate. This principle was indeed recognized and reinforced by\nrescripts granted Jews and Christians under al-Malik al-Afdal. A\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The vast material on the subject can\nbe grouped under three different heads. First, persons approached a\ngovernment court when the law applied there was more advantage-\nous to them. Second, for litigants unsuccessful in a lawsuit in the\nJewish court, the government served as a kind of court of appeal; or\nvice versa, when the opposite party refused to appear before the Jew-\nish court, government was approached with the request to force him\nto do so. Finally, deeds were made out at a government court (or,\nconcurrently there and before a Jewish authority) in order to safe-\nguard their legality and to have them as an instrument of proof\nshould litigation at a government court ensue.\n\nThe first point is best illustrated by examples from the field of\nsuccession. The Muslim and Jewish laws of inheritance differed not\nonly with respect to females as sole heirs, but in many other points\nas well. This contrast owed to their entirely different origins. Israel-\nite law, like the Roman and Germanic, grew in a peasants’ society,\nwhich is eager to hold an estate together in an agricultural unit large\nenough to sustain a family. For this reason, laws of inheritance give\nthe firstborn preferential treatment, a trait unknown to Muslim law.\nOn the other hand, the ancient Arabs were Bedouins and merchants\nwhose possessions were flocks, goods, and cash, which, unlike land,\nlent themselves easily to division.

It was\nnatural that in such cases Jews tried to take advantage of the privi-\nleges offered to them by the law of Islam. For example, if a son and\na daughter were the heirs, according to the ancient Jewish peasants’\nlaw the son took the whole estate, normally the father’s farm, but he\nwas under the obligation to provide his sister with a marriage por-\ntion. In Islam, according to the principle that a female was worth\nhalf a male, the brother received two-thirds of the estate and the\nsister one-third. To forestall a conflict between his children arising\nfrom the discrepancy in coexistent laws, a Jewish father would will\ntwo-thirds of his property to his son and one-third to his daughter, or\nprovide the latter with a house and other parts of her marriage por-\ntion early in life. Similarly, Jewish courts would compensate sisters,\nor the families of sisters, with an appropriate share in order to avoid\nthe interference of government agencies.!3 These precautionary mea-\nsures must have been successful, for cases of a sister claiming a share\nin an inheritage from her brother in a Muslim court are extremely\nrare4 One must bear in mind that lawsuits of a sister against a\nbrother were almost unheard of in this period, since he was regarded\nas her natural protector against her husband.\n\nWhen a father “sells” to his firstborn one-half a house, but wills\nto two others one-quarter each, it is evident that the “sale” was a\nformality intended to safeguard the rights of the firstborn and to\ndeprive the others of the possibility of claiming equal shares in a\nMuslim court.l® When Jewish authorities allot a small part of the\nestate of a man whose only heir was a daughter to the son of his\npaternal uncle, they no doubt acted so because Muslim law granted\nthe nephew this right.18 A protracted lawsuit between a father and\nhis son over the latter’s inheritance from his mother, grandmother,\nand great-grandmother was argued before a Muslim qadi, but was\nfinally settled in a Jewish court on December 31, 1100. Naturally, we\nread in the Geniza records only about cases connected in some way\nor another with Jewish courts?\n\nTo be accurate, the protracted lawsuit was originally an appeal to\nMuslim authorities against the decisions of a Jewish court. Such\nappeals were made even in family matters, normally the prerogative\nof the denominational judiciary. In Maimonides' times, when a\nKohen was refused by Jewish authorities the permission to marry a\ndivorcee (prohibited by Jewish law) he contracted the marriage in a\nMuslim court.

When an Arabic hujja,\nor legal document, containing all the details of a case is attached to a\nJewish record merely summarizing its upshot, it stands to reason that\nthe Jewish court was approached solely out of religious scruples.\nSimilarly, when a contract presupposing hidden interest is made be-\ntween two Jews and a Muslim before a rabbinical court in Alexandria,\nit was probably done to give the transaction additional force.?®\n\nIn principle, Christian and Jewish authorities alike regarded any\napplication to a Muslim court by one of their flock as a religious\noffense. As we have already seen, this transgression was liable to be\npunished with excommunication! In quite a number of Geniza\nrecords, the contracting parties undertake not to apply to a gentile\ncourt. This was done not only in matters of family law and inheri-\ntance (documents dated 1052, 1117, and 1055), but also with regard\nto purely commercial matters (dated 1027, 1052, and 1098). The very\nfact that such provisions were stipulated in contracts proves, though,\nhow common the practice of turning to the state judiciary had be-\ncome, and we are not astonished to find a judge newly transferred to\nal-Mahalla stating with relief that his flock apply solely to him and\nnever “transgress” to a Muslim court.3? There are many references\nto this fact in the responsa of the Gaons and those of Moses and\nAbraham Maimonides, and its discussion betrays many shades of\nopinion. The different views on this complicated problem voiced in\nthose sources can be summarized as follows: While, in principle, only\nthe denominational courts had religiously approved competence, it\nwas permitted and even recommendable to apply to the state authori-\nties when the causes of justice and expediency were served by such a\nstep.\n\nThe numerous relevant Geniza records are in the same vein. Al-\nmost all the powers of attorney made out in Jewish courts allow the\nappointee to bring the person or persons accused before a gentile\ncourt. Letters of attorney were written mostly in extreme cases after\nall other means had failed. Therefore, it was assumed that only the\nthreat of arraignment by a government authority would bring the\nrecalcitrant debtor to reason. The creditor would deposit his “Arabic\nlegal proofs,” that is, documents written by a Muslim notary and\nwitnessed by Muslims, with the Jewish court in deference to Jewish\njurisdiction, but received the permission to make use of them in a\nMuslim court should the opposing party not turn up at the béth\ndin,3® When an Iragian Gaon gave a decision in 1166 in a case of\n\nGoitein, S.

The Muslim authorities on their side did not accept any\nJewish case indiscriminately and, as the Geniza shows, there was a\ngood deal of cooperation between the state and the denominational\ncourts. A slave girl, who claimed to be Jewish, was sent by a Muslim\njudge back to his Jewish colleague.3® When two parties, after having\nmade a settlement in the Jewish court of Alexandria in 1152, wanted\nto make a different one before the qadi “according to the noble reli-\ngion of the Muslims,” the qadi sent his messengers first to the rab-\nbinate, where a declaration, properly fortified by the symbolic\npurchase, was deposited by the parties acknowledging that they\nannulled their former arrangements.37 A female heir, who felt herself\nwronged by a Jewish judge to the advantage of her late father’s busi-\nness partners and who had applied to the qadi of Alexandria, was\nfavorably treated by the qadi, but was directed for a final settlement\nto the Nagid Mevérakh in the capital 38 There is no need to empha-\nsize that such cooperation prevailed particularly in the realm of\nfamily law.3?

Months of travel separated Baghdad from\nQayrawin, and the latter from Sijilmasa, Several frontiers of mu-\ntually hostile countries had to be traversed. Still, the disposal of the\ndeceased’s estate is treated here as an entirely Jewish affair. No ref-\nerence is made to the governments of the countries concerned. In-\nstead, all the Jewish authorities, religious and lay, ecumenical,\nterritorial, and local, are involved. Could there be a more eloquent\ntestimony to the autonomous character of a non-Muslim community\nwithin a Muslim state, as revealed by Geniza documents?\n\nNaturally, this is not the whole story. Looking back on the varied\nmaterial assembled in this volume one turns cautious and feels that\nit is not easy to discern how much of the communal life described\nhere was the fruit of long-standing tradition and inner strength and\nhow much was due to outside pressures and models. Where pre-\nIslamic precedents, parallels from Christian countries, or definitely\nun-Islamic elements prevail, autonomous developments should be\nassumed. The yeshiva was pre-Islamic, and, even during the heyday\nof Islam, differed completely from its Islamic counterpart, the mad-\nrasa (as far as it could be compared with the yeshiva at all). There-\nfore, the ecumenical Jewish authority and all that is connected with\nit, in particular, the diocesan organization of the diaspora, which\nlater gave rise to religious and secular territorial heads, must be re-\ngarded as essentially autochthonous, The Jewish local community,\nwith the prominent participation of the laity in all its functions, is\nage-old and, as far as our present knowledge goes, nothing compar-\nable with it existed in Islam. The works of charity described in this\nvolume had their roots in talmudic ordinances and were matched by\nthose practiced by Jews in Christian countries, although we are less\nwell informed about them since a Geniza has not yet been found in\nEurope. Jewish education grew organically out of the needs and\npractices of Jewish religion many centuries prior to the rise of Islam,\nbut was open to Islamic influences because of the close affinity be-\ntween the two religions. Secular education within the Jewish com-\nmunity was identical with the courses of study in the corresponding\nsocial milieus of Muslims and Christians.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "404 Muslim Government vii, D, 2\n\n‘The impact of the environment was strongest where the contacts\nwere broadest: in the economic, legal, and political spheres. Ulti-\nmately, all power and authority rested with the state. But before the\nstate’s influence can be appraised, some preliminary questions must\nbe asked: What was the character of this state? How far was it willing\nand able to occupy itself with its non-Muslim subjects?\n\nIn our days, most inhabitants of the globe live either under totali-\ntarian systems or in welfare states. In one way or another, the personal\nfortunes of the individual citizen are affected by the state day in and\nday out. Things being so we are hardly able to envisage a state en-\ntirely different from what we are accustomed to. The Muslim state,\nlike most others in the past, was concerned mainly with supplying\ntwo precious commodities: security and justice. Not more. The wel-\nfare of people—providing them with food, clothing, shelter, medical\ncare, education, and other needs of life—~was the concern of God. God\ndevolved his task on human charity, obligatory on everyone, in the\nfirst place, of course, on those with power and wealth. The state as\nsuch had contact with its subjects only in two respects: it needed\ntheir money in order to maintain court, army, administration, and\njudiciary, and provided them with police and juridical protection—\nif asked for. The institution of public prosecutor was unknown. In-\nstead, every Muslim was under the obligation “to order people to act\nproperly and to prevent them from acting improperly.” This im-\nportant koranic precept could be and was understood and applied in\nvery different ways by both individuals and whole groups. The Almo-\nhads of North Africa coerced Christians and Jews to accept Islam and\nput to death Muslims who refused to conform with their particular\ncreed. The Fatimids of Egypt were of the opposite type. They ex-\ncelled in laissez-faire, out of indolence, it seems, rather than convic-\ntion, The far-reaching degree of autonomy enjoyed by the Jews (and,\nof course, the Christians) during their rule has a very simple explana-\ntion: their Muslim subjects, too, were left mostly to their own devices.\n\nThe data about communal life culled from the Geniza should be\nunderstood in the light of this situation. Everyone wishing to exer-\ncise authority, the exilarch, the Gaons of Baghdad and Jerusalem,\nterritorial and local leaders, and, of course, the Christian patriarchs\nand other dignitaries, needed the backing of the state. But it was the\nperson seeking appointment, or his followers, who were eager to ob-\ntain such confirmation; the state itself was not particularly interested\nin providing the dhimmis, or non-Muslim groups, with a strong or-\nganization. The assumption that it was the Muslim state that united\nthe Jewish congregations into local communities shows very little\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Certainly there was no\ngovernment initiative, for the relevant decrees were given at the\nrequest of the interested parties, The same happened during the\nthree years of communal strife resulting from the rivalry between the\nPalestinian Gaons Solomon b. Judah and Nathan b. Abraham (1038-\n1041). Once, at the request of one or two of the parties, a high Jewish\npersonage in Cairo, apparently a government official, was appointed\nto put the affair in order. But he did nothing, and no further action\n‘was taken by the central government. After some time, the crisis came\nto a head anew and the government was approached again by both\nsides. Finally, the authority of the legitimate Gaon was upheld by\nthe government, but, as the document reveals, the settlement between\nthe parties resulted from the intervention of the Jewish laity.5\n\nSince the local community leaders were appointed or confirmed in\ntheir position by the Gaon of Jerusalem, they were quasi government\nofficials, and misgivings about them were voiced before the Muslim\nauthorities in the form of complaints over the Gaon who was re-\nsponsible for them (Solomon b. Judah).® Conversely, when, in 1134,\nthe prerogatives of Masliah, the head of the Palestinian yeshiva, who\nthen had his seat in (New) Cairo, were not respected in Aden, his\nsupporters, who happened to pass through that south-Arabian port\non their way back from India, threatened to apply to the local Mus-\nlim authorities for redress.” Confirmation of local leaders by the state\nis rarely mentioned during the Fatimid period, and then only in the\ncase of dissension. When Abraham (I1I) b. Nathan (II), originally a\nhigh dignitary of the Palestinian yeshiva, met with much opposition\nwhile trying to create for himself a position in Egypt, he requested\nNahray b. Nissim to secure for him “government papers.”8\n\nThe position seems to have changed slightly under the Ayyubids.\nIn Saladin’s time, a Jewish judge in Alexandria declares having re-\nceived a letter of appointment from no one except the sultan (mean-\ning: none from a Jewish authority), which he had presented to the\ngovernor of the city.?

In accordance\nwith this situation Jewish judges received, or expected to receive, a\nsalary or pension from the Ayyubid rulers. But there seems to have\nbeen no regularity in this matter.1*\n\nThe dangerous practice of turning to the Muslim government even\nin controversies of a purely religious nature became rampant in\nAyyubid times. The Ayyubids were Kurds and staunch supporters of\nstrict orthodoxy and the preservation of established rites. No wonder\nthat the opponents of innovations in the Jewish cult were confident\nto have the ear of a similarly minded government. A case in point is\nthe rescript of a sultan in favor of the retaining of the time-honored\npoetical insertions into the synagogue liturgy, which reformers, for\nvarious reasons, wished to abolish, or, at least, to reduce in size.13 The\nGeniza has indeed preserved a query written in Arabic characters and\naddressed to one ‘Imiad al-Din, entitled mufti dawlat amir al-\nMwminin, “legal expert of the realm of the caliph,” containing this\nquestion: Jewish prayer on workdays, Sabbaths, and holidays follows\nancient patterns and long-established customs. Now certain people\nwant to introduce changes. Are such innovations permissible “in the\ndays of Islam, may God make them permanent”? The expected an-\nswer was, of course, that any “innovation” was anathema.\n\nEven more serious was the action taken with the Ayyubid govern-\nment by the adversaries of the Nagid Abraham Maimonides, using as\npretext his pietist reforms. Abraham strove to give the service a\nstrictly devotional character. The members of the congregation\nshould be seated in rows facing the Holy Ark (and not along the walls\nfacing each other, as is still the custom in Oriental synagogues), cush-\nions and pillows should be banned, and, when seated at all, everyone\nshould maintain an upright position. Prosternations and genuflec-\ntions, as of old, should underline the character of the prayer as\n“service,” and copious ablutions precede them—stressing man’s need\nfor inner purification. The text of the liturgy was also to be reformed.\nThe opponents of these measures, led by Abraham Maimonides’\npolitical foes, approached the sultan al-Malik al-‘Adil (d. 1218), and\nthe Nagid took pains to explain that his reforms were a matter of\npersonal religion and confined to his private synagogue; he did not\nuse his office in order to exercise pressure on anyone to make changes\nin his established customs. How aware Abraham was of the dangerous\ncharacter of such an accusation may be gauged from the fact that he\n\nGoitein, S. D.

When, however, the\nMonk confiscated all money on which he could lay his hands, the then ad-\nministrator of the pious foundations distributed the sum at hand to the poor\nand had the text of the will changed accordingly.\n\nThe cdited tex: needs some slight revision.

It reads: minha yusraf immd fi shardb, “the balance should\nbe used either for medicine.”\n\nF.130v,1. 9: .tmh; read ktbh, “which he wrote.”\n\nIbid,, L. 12: read @manu and translate: “This was safer than that the Monk\nshould hear that money was deposited with him.” The interpretation of the\ndocument should be changed accordingly.\n\nThe will was made in favor of both the Rabbanite and Karaite communi-\nties, but my surmise (Journal of Jewish Studies, 12 {1961], 153) that it was\nmade before a Karaite court is not borne out by the text, which says only\nthat the head of the Karaites, their muqaddam, possessed a copy of the will.\n\n129.

Detailed report, in large, clear Arabic script,\nabout work done intermittently by at least seven different masons—normally\ntwo working together on one day—and one carpenter during July through\nNovember 1045 (sce A 9, 123). The report used the reverse side of a letter\nfrom Qayrawin written on parchment. One of the masons, Abu ’l-Yumn\nal-shammas (the deacon) certainly was a Christian, and another, called Ja‘far,\na Muslim. The names of the others could have been borne by Jews.

For this purpose, the money was delivered to the parnis Abi Sa‘d,\n“the Head of the Congregations,” who died, however, “under the well-known\ncircumstances,” perhaps on his way to Alexandria. The problem now was\nhow to retrieve the 5 dinars.

TS K 15, fs. 14 and 66, the latter forming the upper part, and the\nformer the lower part, of one list of about a hundred persons, all male,\nforeigners, laborers, craftsmen mostly of lower standing, community officials,\npersons called ghuldm or sabi, that is, slave, freedman, or employee, and five\nothers designated as damin, persons for whom security was given. They\ncontribute or are asked to contribute from Vs to 34 dinar, that is, a partial\npayment of the poll tax, the community making up the balance. The sums\nfollowing the names may also indicate the amounts to be paid by the com-\nmunity (see B 58).\n\nThe notables whose employees are mentioned (Dosa, Ibn Sighmir, Ibn\n‘Awkal [son of the famous Joseph], Bahiidi, Ibn Hirbish) were active around\n1040.\n\nForeigners: From Palestine, 5 (Tiberias, 3; Baniyas, 1; Jish, 1, the latter\nalso B 9, 1. 21); Persia, 2; Tiflis, 1; Spain, 3; Saqlabi (of Slavic origin), 1.\nSome names are only partly visible.\n\n6. TS K 15, f. 93. A list of about ninety persons similar to the preceding\none. Many names and sums identical with those in it. Three details call for\nspecial comment. As in official documents from the Fatimid chancelleries,\nblank space, three times as wide as the height of the script, is left between\nthe lines. Thus, no doubt, the list was destined for public display.\n\nIn one place, col. I, 1. 2, the words “from the collection, pesiqa” are added.\nCertainly a special circumstance, where it was found that the person con-\ncerned was unable to pay even the very reduced rate of 14 dinar imposed\non him.\n\nVerso, col. 11, 1. 11, Yahyi al-Majjani is listed with 9 qirats. Yahya b. Misa\nal-Majjani was a Qayrawanese merchant commuting to Egypt and known\nfrom many Geniza documents. It would be hazardous to assume that another\nperson bearing the same rare name (derived from Majjana, a little town in\ninland Tunisia) lived in Egypt at that time. It is more probable that the\nwell-known Yahya al-Majjini was in dire straits that particular year (as we\nfind him in Bodl. MS Heb. a 2 [Cat. 2805], f. 17°, and in other letters of his)\nand was therefore assisted with the payment of his poll tax. This point\nneeded elucidation because a list containing the name of a well-knawn\nmerchant is taken prima facie as one of contributors, not of beneficiaries of\na reduced poll tax.\n\nForeigners: From Palestine, 5 (only 1, Sa'd al-Baniyasi, identical with\nthose in the preceding section; Acre, 1; Haifa, 1; Tiberias, 1, “the man from\nJerusalem who works with Qasim, the silk-weaver”); Maghreb, 4; Persia, 8\n(among them a cantor and one called Mordecai, a name rare at that time in\nthe West, but appropriate in Persia, the scene of the biblical story of Mor-\ndecai and Esther); Iraq (‘Ukbara), 1; Barqa, 1; Sicily, 1; Spain, 1.\n\nGoitein, S.

Ten weekly payrolls for the second through the tenth\nweeks and then again for the fourteenth week of the liturgical year, which\nbegins after the autumn holidays. In this account and those in B 41, 42, and\n49 the total sum spent on the distribution of loaves is also listed every week.\n\nThese important lists are drafts in the hand of Solomon, the son of judge\nElijah, presumably in preparation of fuller reports such as those represented\nin B 41 and 44b. Each week is headed by its liturgical name (mostly differing\nfrom those used in the synagogue today, but easily recognizable) and the\nsum put at the disposal of the writer. Often noted, too, are the name of the\ncollector who handed over the money (always onc), 2 balance from the pre-\nceding week, or arrears due on its account. Then, never in the same order,\nfollow the items actually paid, concluding with the balance remaining or\ndue, Payments to officials (not their total salary, of course, but their share in\nthe weekly collection) remain the same for many weeks: “the cantor~7 [dir-\nhems], [the judge] R. Jephthah—635, the Cleaner—4, R. Yeshi'a—3, judge\nManasse—214, the two beadles [namely, Tihir and Mahisin]—4 [together].”\nWhen we find Mahasin once with 214 dirhems, the reason is that 14 dirhem\nwent to raisins for the “wine” used during the service, as evident from the\nitem “beadle and raisins—214\" in the eighth week and the payment of 2\ndirhems to each beadle in B 445 and 48b. The weekly expenditure on bread\nwas 29, 30, 3015, 32, 32%, 38Y4 dirhems and similar sums. Compare this with\n12814 in B 27 and the amounts in B 19-24. It is possible, however, that there\nwere one or several distributions handled by other communal officials, whose\nnotes have not come down to us (cf. B 27, where we indeed find three\ndistributors).\n\n41. TS Misc. Box 8, f. 100. Similar payroll in the same hand as preceding\npayrolls for the scventh and eighth weeks of another year. Mostly same\nnames and sums. The entries for the eighth week are in Arabic script. Some\npayments of arrears from the sixth week are also noted.\n\nThis is a full report. The numerals are nnt defined. In the first 15 lines\nthey represent dirhems, in the remaining 20, loaves of bread. Proof: (a) the\nbeadles appear twice, because they receive their cash payment in the first\npart, their bread in the second. The same in B 44b, 11 1-14 and 15-31. (b)\nThe numbers of loaves of the families of the beadles and of some other\nhouseholds are completely, or almost completely, identical with B 47, which\nis expressly characterized as a distribution of bread on a Friday.\n\nThere remains another difficulty. In B 42, 1. 20, 150 pounds of bread cost\n15 dirhems (their transport % dirhem), in B 47, bottom (upside down, Coptic\nnumerals), the same amount costs 13-1/3. The total loaves or pounds dis-\ntributed in this payroll was 126 (see below). Since the standard price in that\nperiod seems to have been 10 pounds for 1 dirhem, as we have seen in B 42\nand 47, one wonders why during the week covered by this payroll the item\n“bread” required 32 dirhems. The solution is this. There still were two\ndistributions every week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, as had been the practice\na hundred and more years before.

The first list comprises about forty persons, of these\nsome scholars, others people originating from places such as Aleppo, Tyre,\nDamascus, Ramle, or the Maghreb, or dealing in Syro-Palestinian products\nsuch as mint and acorns, or persons in inferior positions, such as the em-\nployee (called sahib in the first list and wakil in the second) of Abit Nasr, or\ntwo gatekeepers of ‘Imrin of Tyre, or the ghulam of Ibn al-Taherti.

The name Ma'ali [bn Dihgén is also\nfound in B 32, which is beyond doubt from the twelfth century, but Dihgan\n(Squire, nobleman of the low gentry, Persian) is a family name found\nthroughout the centuries, and Ma‘ali is a common personal name.\n\nBesides outsiders from Ram, Damascus, Tyre, Haifa, and Buzi‘a (near\nAleppo), one is listed as Misri, that is, from Fustat.

But it would be odd to assume that “the blind” of Fustat had\nto walk twice a week the two miles to Cairo to get their shares. The com-\nplainant must therefore have been a Cairene who came to a dignitary in\nFustat to lodge a daim with him. In most of the longer lists of poor from\nFustat one or several blind are mentioned, but their number is smaller than\none would expect.

Many of the 105 or so\nnames are found in secs. 4 through 8, above, especially in secs. 6-8. Late\neleventh century.\n\nForeigners: 2 from Iraq (Baghdad, Mosul); 4, Syria-Lebanon (Damascus,\n2 from Tyre, 1, Ladhiqiyya); 4, Palestine (Acre, Haifa, Jaffa, Tiberias); 1,\nLibya (Barqa); 1, Rim.\n\nAmong the occupations: 3 muqaddams, 2 teachers, 1 cantor, 4 clerks of\nprivate persons, referred fo as sabi, katib, and sahib, respectively; a musician\n(alati; in sec. 6, col. II, 1. 1: Bishr, the stepson of the musician; here: Bishr,\nthe musician; when his mother remarried, she probably stipulated that her\nhusband should teach him his art); an cmbroiderer (ragqdm, rare); many\nfrom the food industry. These two lists significantly complement secs. 4\nthrough 8 above.\n\n108. TS Arabic Box 40, f. 161. List of names, many rare, of male persons.\nThe document is in Arabic characters, with the exception of the heading,\nwhich is in Hebrew: “The progeny blessed by the Lord” (Isaiah 65:23). Sev-\neral persons are described solely as the sons of, or are listed together with\nunnamed brothers. The occupations mentioned are low (porter, cook, seller\nof hazelnuts, roaster of lupines, measurer of grain, etc) Many foreigners,\namong them three Palestinians (from Banyas, Dalata, Tiberias); Eli ha-Kohen\nis most probably the poet Eli ha-Kohen b. Ezekiel, who was active in Egypt\naround 1030.\n\nThe heading is euphemistic. It designates poor people, probably requiring\nassistance for the payment of their poll tax.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

A further proof of this assumption are sums such as “3 dinars\nless 1 girat” (col. II, 1. 7), or “114 dinars less one habba” (col. IL, 1. 13). (On\nthe other hand, “Abu ’I-Ma‘dli b.

        "text": "484 Appendix C: Contributors\n\nPart C begins on page ¢, col. I, after 1. 2 and after a blank space of five\nlines. It lists the contributors in groups according to the amount donated:\n\n15 households contributing 114 dirheins each, total 2214 dithems\n36 households contributing 1  dirhems each, total 36  dirhems\n8 households contributing 14 dirhem each, total 4 dirhems\n1 household contributing Y% dirthem each, total 14 dirhem\n\n \n\n60 households contributing a total of 6234 dirhems\n\n(A note on the margin has 6214, but the first letter might be r = 200, and\nthe note might refer to something else.)\n\nAll these were actual payments, not pledges, as proved by the fact that\nnine donors noted on the first day appear again on the second with an addi-\ntional gift, for example, Ma‘ali b. Nu‘min (see C 30) gives 1 wayba on the\nfirst day (p. a, 1. 6) and 114 dirhems on the second (p. ¢, col. I, 1. 7). Another\nproof: the contribution of an order of payment drawn on another person\n(p- b, col. 11, 1. 18-19).\n\nIn this list, four persons are noted together with their partners, one with\nhis employee, one with his brother-in-law, and one item reads “the shop of”\n(p. d, col. 11, L. 5). Sons and brothers are listed scparately, albeit sometimes\nwith very small sums. Reason: these donations were certainly made in con-\nnection with the fast of the Ninth of Av. Giving alms on a fast was an act\nof piety and had an expiating power. Therefore, everyone had to give in\nperson.\n\nAssuming that a wayba cost 6 dirhems (see above) and taking into account\nthat nine persons donated twice, the contributions might be summarized\nthus:\n\n1firm gives 18 dirhems\n1 firm gives 71 dirhems\n\n10 firms give 6 dirhems Reduced to six main groups:\n\n5firmsgive 5 dirhems I 1gives 18 dirhems\n7 firms give 3 dirhems II. 16 give 5 -7v dirhems\n3 firms give 214 dirhems 1I1. 10 give 214-3  dirhems\n19 firms give 2 dirhems 1v. 85 give  1%4-2 dirhems\n16 firms give 114 dirhems V. 38 give 1 dirhem\n38 firmsgive 1 dirhem VI. 12 give Y4— V4 dirhem\n\n1t firms give V5 dirhem\n1 firm gives 14 dirthem\n\nTotal 112 firms consisting at least of 117 persons\n\nThe main groups were not divided entirely according to the professions of\nthe donors. Taking as indicators the two most common professions men-\ntioned, that of the ‘aftdr, perfumer, and sayrafi, banker or money changer,\nthis distribution emerges:\n\n2 ‘attars each contribute 6 dirhems 1 sayrafi contributes 6 dirhems\n2 ‘attars each contribute 3 dirhems 2 sayrafi contribute 5 dirhems\n3 ‘attars each contribute 1 dirhem 2 sayrafi contribute 3 dirhems\n\n2 sayrafi contribute 2 dirhems\n1 sayrafi contributes 114 dirhems\n2 sayrafi contribute 1 dirhem\n1 sayrafi contributes 1; dirhem\n\nGoitein, S.

With three exceptions (includ-\ning two names written on the margin), all names are preceded by a stroke,\nindicating perhaps that the task of soliciting the persons concerned had\nbeen assigned.\n\n35. TS 10 J 26, f. 13v. Upper part of a fragmentary list, written in the\nhand of the judge Samuel b. Saadya (see A 26), on: the reverse side of a docu-\nment issued on the authority of Maimonides in spring 1172. The contribu-\ntions are partly in dinars (14-2, the latter sum appearing four times), partly\nin dirhems. Practically all the names recur in contemporary lists, but because\nof the dilapidated state of the manuscript no general conclusions are pos-\nsible. Of the sixteen persons whose names are discernible in the left column,\nfour give together with their partners.\n\n36-58.

Elazar ha-Kohen) is known from many docu-\nments signed by him from [208 through 1222 and others whose dates are\nnot preserved.\n\nThere might be some connection between the two pages. The congratula-\ntory poem strangely concludes with a stanza directed against the adversaries\nof the Nagid (Abraham Maimonides), who is advised to excommunicate\nthem. A report about machinations against the Nagid (TS Arabic Box 51, f.\n111* [see chap. v, sec. A, 2, n. 50]) mentions that, at the time of the crisis, a\nlarge gathering was convened, but instead of excommunicating his adver-\nsaries, the Nagid threatened with this punishment those who had made\npledges for Dammiih, but had not yet paid. Our list might well represent one\ngroup of such defaulters. TS 10 J 82, f. 12*, is a circular admonishing the\ncommunity to contribute toward the upkeep of Dammih.\n\n87. ENA 2727, £. 15E.

(The editor erroneously mistook the sign for\n1 as another form of 1; in seventeen entries in his last column—which,\nactually, is the first (see below), and contains the names of most of the\nnotables—the number 1 is to be replaced by 14, easily verifiable by the total\nwritten at the end of the page.)) While in many collections the upper class\nshoulders the main burden (see, e.g., 30, 33, 40), a fact conspicuous especially\nin appeals to a limited number of persons (e.g., C 23, 24, 41-43), here the\nbulk of the revenue comes from small contributions, and there is little grada-\ntion in scale. List C 32, where practically everyone gives the same small sum,\nand which is very neatly written with totals at the end of each column, is\nvery much of the same type as our list, but, because of its fragmentary state,\ncannot contribute much to a comparative study of both. Too, our list is un-\ndoubtedly incomplete; since it notes the totals of each column, there must\nhave been the customary final column summarizing the totals.\n\nTentatively, I take these lists as yearly pledges for the weekly contribu-\ntions toward feeding the poor and paying the community officials (see C 49).\nCharity is obligatory on every Jew (as on every Muslim or Christian), and its\ncontinuous practice was safeguarded by these pledges, the amounts of which\nwere held to a comparatively low and general level. The innumerable col-\nlections for special purposes or on extraordinary occasions gave the more\nopulent or more liberal members of the community the opportunity to prove\ntheir mettle.\n\nNotes on the edited text: The sequence of columns as printed has to be\nreversed: the first is verso, col. Il = g; recto, col. T = b; recto, col. II = ¢;\nverso, col. I = d. Reason: the scribe folded a leaf so as to form a booklet of\nfour columns. Most (but not all) the Geniza scribes folded their paper so;\nthat it was done here is proved by the state of the leaf and the fact that col. a\nstarts with the judge Hananel, followed by the notables, most of whom are\nknown from contemporary documents and who alone contribute sums of 1\nor more. For easier identification, however, in the fo]lowing all references\nare made to the columns in the sequence in which they are printed by\nStrauss Ashtor.\n\nThe printer omitted the totals at the end of recto, cols. I (10) and II\n(9). On verso, col. II, there are two sums, one, 2314 (of course, not: 23 1, as\nprinted [see my comment above, about the sign 14]) and another, 22 less a\nquarter (read r = ruba‘i, a quarter, not d). The words “less a quarter” seem\nto be crossed out, but are correct according to my own summation (one num-\neal is not quite clear).\n\nRecto, col. I\n1. 2 ndkhoda is not a captain, but a shipowner.\n1. 14 al-t! read al-nil, trader in indigo.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

All three—taking Aba Zikri as the elder son of the\njudge Elijah, who was a prominent physician in Alexandria—are conspicu-\nous in TS 10 J 16, f. 6, a complaint by the administrator of the quppd, or\nbreadbasket of the community, in Alexandria who was threatened with\ndeath when he retained certain quantities of wheat in order to meet emer-\ngencies in a time of scarcity.

Jesse and his son Abi Nasr Samuel, the latter men-\ntioned, e.g., in TS 20.175), and then “Our Master Samuel and his boy,”\nprobably the French rav, who was Jewish chief justice in Alexandria before\nmoving to Cairo (see TS 10 J 19, f. 14, L. 15). Each of the three pays 2 dirhems,\nor 1 for each adult male, like all other persons except those engaged in\nspecifically lucrative occupations.\n\nThe list, although only a partial one, is the most comprehensive found\nthus far in the Geniza with regard to this period.

TS NS J 384. Nethanel reports to a relative (as whose pupil he de-\nscribes himself) that a collection (called siniyya, lit., “tray”) arranged at the\nwedding of Musallam the embroiderer, brought around 30 dirhems. Since\nNethanel was not present the money was handed over to the “Pride of the\nCantors,” who did not deliver it to the addressee, as usual, but to the writer.\nWas this a collection for the poor or one for the cantors functioning at wed-\ndings? The addressee presumably acted also as a cantor, since the writer most\nurgently asks him to deliver to the bearer of his letter the “Rahaman” (Heb.),\na religious poem beginning with this word (Oh Merciful, like Kyrie eleison\nin the Church). At Muslim weddings it was common custom to collect money\non a tray for the musicians active at the celebrations, see, for instance, The\nArabian Nights, Story of Nir al-Din and Shams al-Din, Night no. 21.

The interesting fact to be learned\nfrom this note is the speediness with which the pledges were collected. There\nare only four days between the Day of Atonement and the beginning of the\nFeast of Tabernacles. The letter scems to assume that, say, on the third day\nof the interval between the two holidays most of the pledges had already\ncome in. -\n\nAnother interesting point is the Nagid's acmonition to think of the poor\non the Siyyam (Heb)), the festive conclusion of the yearly reading of the\nPentatcuch, which takes place at the end of the autumn holidays.\n\n133.

He was called\nJoseph al-Rimi and had come to the Mediterranean port of Damietta with\na letter of recommendation from the Nagid Samuel b, Hananya. The appeal\n(presumably made on the Day of Atonement) brought 1 dinar worth of\ndirhems. The traveler boarded a Nile boat on the eve of the Feast of Taber-\nnacles (“at sunset,” i.e., when, according to strict custom, the holiday had\nalready begun) and, after having collected the money on the half-holiday\nimmediately following the Feast, and also wares “for the perfumers in Sam-\nmanad,” he departed.\n\nWorking-day actions, such as traveling or accepting money and merchan-\ndise, are not prohibited on a half-holiday (the meaning of mé‘ed [IL. 8, 12]),\nbut were avoided by the more scrupulous. The purport of the rather excep-\ntional document seems to be that the foreigner did not really deserve the\nrecommendation of the Nagid.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

A collection for the man from\nAntiochia.”\n\nWritten, but not very carefully, by the scribe of A, sec. 15, B, secs. 18, 17,\n18, G, secs. 16-18. The list is arranged in four columns and divided into six\nsections, bearing the dates of the days on which the various collections were\nmade. Around 1100. The manuscript is defective; names, dates, and sums\nare often incompletely preserved.\n\nThe sums contributed were astoundingly small, ranging from 1614 dirhems\ncollected from 5 persons, to 10214 dirhems given by 22 contributors; but sev-\neral persons, about 10, contributed more than once. Many of the altogether\nabout 70 names preserved are identical with those listed in secs. 16-18, ahove.\nThe contributions were made mostly in dirhems, but on the second and third\ndays, in qirits, which is exceptional. Abii ‘All. that is, Tapheth b. Abraham,\n“The Pride” (see secs. 16, 19-21), gave V4 dinar, converted into 24 dirhems,\nwhich is in conformity with the exceptionally low exchange rate of the\ndirhem in thosc days (1:48) (sce Med. Soc., 1, 378-379, sccs. 38-44). The high-\nest payment in dirhems was made by Abii Ya‘qib al-Hakim (sce sec. 16. and\nespecially sec. 21, above) , namely 6 dirhems, then worth 14 dinar. Several pay-\nments were made through the banker Sadaqa al-*Attar (ool 11, 1L 9, 21, 29).\n\nThe whole collection mus: have brought less than 10 dinars, far less than\nneeded for the ransom of a captive. When we remember that Antiochia was\ntaken by the Crusaders in 1096, “the man from Antiochia\"” might have been\nransomed with money provided by a notable, partly to be restituted by the\ncommunity. Our list might have been drawn up for such a purpose. There\nare, of course, other possibilities.

MS Heb. d 66 [Cat. 2878] f. 58). Thus, there too, per-\nhaps each of the two rites possessed a house of worship. For Palmyra see Mann, I,\n37, n. 1. (Tadmor is the correct reading despite the remark in Mann, II, 341) E.\nAshtor (Zion, 30 [1965], 62 n. 7) maintains that even a small place like Minyat\nGhamr had two such congregations and adduces TS 18 J 16, £. 4, as proof.

Since the term “great\nsynagogue” is rendered in our documents not oaly in Hebrew and in Arabic, but\nalso in Aramaic (Worman, ibid.), we may safely assume that this differentiation\ngoes back to the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century at latest.\n\nA record book from Damascus, dated 933, states three times that the marriages\nregistered were contracted “according to the custom of the small synagogue of the\nBabylonians” (TS 16.181, ed. Assaf, Texts, pp. 64-69). This should not be under-\nstood as meaning that the Iragians had two synagogues in Damascus, one large\nand another small, but that the Babylonian synagogue was called “the small” as\nopposed to the main synagogue which followed the Palestinian rite (see S. D.\nGoitein, “Four Ancient Marriage Contracts,” L&Sonénu, 30 [1966), 201 n. 6). For\nthe Muslim historians on the synagogues of Damascus see N.

Every\nweckday morning, in winter before, and in summer after the service (which means\n6:30 A.m. at latest) he gave a course to a select group of students and laymen, In\naddition, he read several classes in the evenings and on Saturday. The man was a\nrich banker and a chain smoker of choice cigars. Never in my life did I enjoy again\nan aroma comparable with that pervading the dayyan's study. Whencver there\narose a difficult problem in the Talmud (and when does it not?), he took his cigar\nout of his mouth, turned it upside down, and carried it in ciicles around his\nnostrils, inhaling the exquisite fragrance of its smoke—and soon the solution was\nfound. He personally acted also as circumciser because he strongly objected to\nphysicians performing that little operation on newly boin boys, lest it lose its\nreligious character and become merely an act of medical treatment (as, indeed, it\nhas in this and other countries). When I studied with him, he had already cir-\ncumcised about 8,800 boys. How could a busy banker indulge in this religious\nsport which might require his absence from office three times a day? He had made\nit a matter of principle not to stay on for a single minute, even with close friends,\nfor the reception or dinner following the ceremony.

The attentive\nreader will have noticed that the average contribution per donor on the two lost\npages would be about 8 dinars (164 — 17 = 147--50), while the last 12 donors\ngave an average of only 114 (17 : 12). This, however, is perfectly in order since\nthe lists always start with the big contributions. For the ten days for which we do\nnot have lists, to assume a daily average of 30 houscholds, each contributing about\n2 dinars, is justified in view of the details set forth in the analysis of G 30. The\ntotals, thus, would be:\n\nFirst day (50 + 12) 62 households\nSecond day 39 \"\nThird to twelfth day 300 ”\nThirteenth day 18 ”\nFourteenth day 5 ”\nTotal 424 households\n\n‘Taking into consideration that contributions were occasionally made by several\n\nGoitein, S.

As late an authority as the Nagid Joshua, the great-great-\ngrandson of Maimonides, writes in the name of his ancestor that the qiddish\nmight be recited in the synagogue, if this was a local custom (see Responsa of\nJostua ha Nagid, ed. A. H. Freimann [Jerusalem, 1940], p. 39). Nowadays, in the\nUnited States and most other countries, the giddiish forms a most solemn part of\nthe synagogue service, but in the Yemenite synagogues it is not recited at all. In\nthe Geniza period it was chanted in the synagogue for the benefit of the foreigners\nwho had no home of their own, but lived in the synagogue compound. In TS 8 J 41,\nf. 11, 1.3+, a boy chants on the anbd! the Nishmat (“All souls praise Your name\"),\nan ancient hymn immediately preceding the official morning prayer.\n\nTS Misc. Box 25, £. 139, 11, 1-2 (which continues f. 132), When it was suggested\nto the writer to excommunicate a man for practicing masturbation, he answers:\nsuch a man is too despicable for being mentioned on the pulpits, ‘ala I-manabir.\nThis phrase is classical Arabic and simply means: in public. In Maimonides,\nResponsa, 11, 316, the editor put al-minbar into the text, but the manuscript has\nal-anbdl. The mistake is corrected in ibid., II[, 127, In ibid., 11, 341, al-minbar is\nused, perhaps by a writer from outside Egypt.\n\n1 The publications rendering the Hebrew inscription, seen by me (including the\nGuide of the Israel Museum up to 1968) provide incorrect readings and transla-\ntions. The first three letters are rwr, with dots on the two #'s which are indicative\nof abbreviations. They stand for (ma)r(éna) wer(abbénit), “our master and teacher,”\nwhich is almost equivalent with modern Mr. The reading David (dwd), besides\nbeing incorrect, is impossible, for double names like “David Solomon,” common in\nlater times, were absolutely unknown to the Arabic-speaking Jews of the High\nMiddle Ages. The eulogy on the deceased is taken from Isaiah 63:14 and should\nbe translated “may God's spirit give him peace,” and not “may the spirit of God\nbring solace to us.” The woodwork on the Louvre piece is more elaborate, but the\nHebrew letters are less well preserved (see, eg., L. A. Mayer, L'art juif en\nterre de I'Islam [Geneva: A, Kundig, 1959], p. 13, and fig. 6b). The pieces in the\nLouvre and the Cairo Museum were accessible to visitors and well displayed when\n1 visited those museums last. For the turners see Med. Soc., I, 423 n. 90,\n\n15 See Med. Soc., I, 398 n. 42, where the sources for the identification of the syna-\ngogue of the Iraqians with the church building are listed. In his Ph.D. dissertation,\nmentioned p. 118, above, Moshe Gil arrived independently at the same result.\nThere exists additional topographical evidence in favor of that assumption.\n\nD, S, Rice, “Studies in Islamic Metal Work V,” BSOA4S, 17 (1955), 206-231\n(with many illustrations). Plates X and XI of this study show a grillwork lamp of\nordinary workmanship dated 1090, which might well have been similar to those\nsuspended at that time in the synagogue of the Palestinians in Fustat. The Star of\nDavid visible on Rice’s lamp was not a Jewish emblem in those days, although the\nrenowned Nahray b. Nissim used it as a trademark on one of his consignmeuts.\n\n When one reads in a letter sent from one country to another the description of\n2 festivity detailing the numbers of wax candles (of different types!), oil lamps, and\nchandeliers illuminating the place one understands the importance attached in\nthose days to proper, or, as the case would be, luxurious, lighting (ENA 4020 [de-\ntached leaf, not yet identified], ed. Mann, I1, 172, 1. 18-19).\n\n8°The covering of columns with siglaton textiles is mentioned in TS 20.47, 1. 12,\ned. E. J. Worman, JQR, 20 (1908), 458-459 (see my note Eretz-Israel, 7 [1964), 92\nn. 65). Certainly not all the columns were covered or covered permanently, for one\naccount has the item: “For the polisher of the columns,” TS 10 JIL, £.26, 1.7\n(App. A, sec. 113).\n\n1 At the time of the edition of the 1159 document in Eretz-Israel, 7 (1964) 94-96,\n1 had only its left half, preserved in TS NS J 296. Because of the importance of the\ndocument I supplemented its right half by surmise. In summer, 1968, I found the\nmissing half, contained in TS Misc.

Tritton uses the word amdrd, which is a more ancient term for\nthe (me)turgeman, the broadcaster of the words of a scholar teaching a large audi-\nence. For the Muslim office of the mustamli (lit., the one who asks the lecturer to\nlet him dictate his words to the students), see the detailed study of Max Weisweiler,\n“Das Amt des Mustamli in der Arabischen Wissenschaft,” Oriens, 4 (1951), 27-57,\nwhere further literature is cited.

It seems that the cantillation of the Talmud had its\norigin in the institution of the (me)turgeman. While the lecturer himself spoke in\nan ordinary tone, the broadcaster, who repeated the latter’s words in a loud voice,\naccompanied them with a singsong, a custom apparently disapproved by the\nmasters of the Talmud themselves, as may be concluded from the puns on Ecclesi-\nastes 7:5 and 9:17: “The words of the wise are spoken quictly”—this refers to the\nlecturer—\"[They] are more acceptable than the shouting of the preacher address-\ning the fools”—\"“This refers to the [mejturgemans, who speak in a loud voice with\na singsong so that they may be heard by the masses™: Kohelet Rabba, referring to\nthe biblical passages cited.

Hofni Gaon. It\nshould be noted that Rava was famous for the excellence of his reasoning,\n\nWhen the Gaon Samucl b.

Shemarya, who had studied\nwith him in Baghdad and was now back in Old Cairo, from where he sent his\n“questions” to his master: “Every letter which reaches us from him is better than\nthe one preceding it and his new questions are continuously superior to the older\nones—and all this while he is still young.” Bodl.

The first word is bn’,\nwhich can be taken either as Heb. beng, expressed with Imala (i.e., @ for é), or as\nan abbreviated Arabic (a)bna.\n\nThe list is headed by Nahray b. Nissim, and the first havér mentioned is Ben\nShema'‘ya, i.e., Abraham b. Shema‘ya (App. D, sec. 12). The rayyis or Nagid heading\n“the Cairenes” was either Mevérikh, or his opponent David b. Daniel. Ben\nShema'ya signed documents also under the latter’s authority (TS 16.77, TS 20.31).\n\nFor *I-sqwy in 1. 14 read al-‘Asgalani, no doubt identical with the cantor from\nAscalon, mentioned in the contemporary list TS Misc.

Although he married in Old Cairo as carly as\nJanuary, 1050 (TS 20.7), many references in the Geniza betray him as a Tunisian.\nSee Med. Soc., 1,529, Index, s.v.

The old usage: “In ancient times, each individual teacher\nlicensed his own students. . . . Later on, honor was given to this house [of king\nDavid, namely to the family of the Nasi, or head of the Jewish community in\nPalestine during its Roman period, which claimed to be descended from the royal\nhouse of Judah). A license issued by the Nasi was valid even without the consent\nof the court {namely, of the yeshiva]). Finally, it was resolved that a license had\nto be given both in the name of the court and the Nasi.” (Palestinian Talmud,\nloc. cit,, 11, 49-56). In Geniza times: TS 12.328”, ha-samikh ba-yeshiva mippi\nrabbé ha-yeshiva, “licensed in the yeshiva by the masters of the yeshiva”; TS\n12.722*, Licensed by both the exilarch and the schools: sec. 7, n. 28, above.\n\n7 For Muslim “permissions” see Tritton, Muslim Education, pp. 40-46 and 201.\nIn the al-Azhar of Cairo no official diploma was granted untit 1872 (B.

From a query by Dr. Ezra Fleischer, dated Dec. 2, 1968,\nabout the name Sakan, otherwise unknown in Hebrew letters, it appears that he\nhad identilied about fifteen liturgical poems with Sakan as acronym.

In 1. 25, where the names are\nrepeated, the scribe (Hillel b.

        "text": "vi, 12 The Medical Profession|Notes 581\n\ninto English by Nina Salaman (Philadelphia, 1924), p. 113. My translation tries to\nrender the intention of the poet, as far as discernible to me.\n\nM This is an allusion to the so-called istikhdra, “letting God choose for us,”\nbefore any undertaking, such as going on a journey, doing some important busi-\nness transaction, or taking a medicine. See Med. Soc., I, 346, where I should have\nremarked perhaps that the custom was already common in Talmudic times (see\nBerakhot 29b), More about this in Med. Soc., Vol. 111, chap. x.\n\n12 The subject of this section has been treated by me in “The Medical Profession\nin the Light of the Cairo Geniza Documents,” HUCA, 34 (1963), 177-194, but 1\nhave now greatly enlarged and thoroughly revised it. For the general background,\nsce H. Friedenwald, The Jews and Medicine (Baltimore, 1944), and Sami Hamar-\nneh, Bibliography on Medicine and Pharmacy in Medieval Islam (Stuttgart, 1964).\nThe Iatter publication is to be used together with the very important study (which\nis partly a review of it) of Otto Spies, “Beitriige zur medizinisch-pharmazeutischen\nBibliographic des Islam,” Der Islam, 44 (1968), 138-173, and the review of Manfred\nUllmann, ZDMG, 118 (1968), 177-179. The delightful paper by Owsei Temkin,\n“Byzantine Medicine: Tradition and Empiricism,” Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 16\n(1962), 97-115, is also relevant. The latest comprehensive work on the subject:\nManfred Ullmana, Die Medizin im Islam, Handbuch der Orientalistik, Ergin-\nzungsband VI (Leiden, 1970). About criticism, and even ridicule of the medical art\nand attempts of its vindication see F. Rosenthal, “The Defense of Medicine in the\nMediacval Muslim World,” Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 43 (1969), 519-532.\n\n13, DRUGGISTS, PHARMACISTS, PERFUMERS, AND\nPREPARERS OF POTIONS\n\n17t is not correct to translate sharabi as wine merchant, as is sometimes done. A\n\npotion, sharab, is frequently mentioned as bought for a sick person. Wine is called\nin the Geniza nabidh or khamr. In the prescription TS Arabic Box 30, f. 65v (see\nn. 30, below) khamr is recommended as an alternative for a sharab. Of course, wine\nitself served as a major medicine (often flavored with various spices or drugs, as in\nENA 2808, f. 22). The tabbakh sharab, “cooker of potions” (App. G, sec. 55), pre-\nsumably produced sharibs wholesale and traded them to retail sharibis.\nA physician practicing in the store of a sharibi is mentioned in ULC Or 1080\n93\"\n! 2 A saydalani is listed in TS 20.168 (App. A, sec. 6) and TS K 15, £. 45 (A 7) as\ntenant in a communal building (1043). Others are mentioned as prospective or\nactual proprictors of houses: TS 16.79+ (1051), TS 13 J 2, £. 3 (1093); in an Arabic\ndocument TS Arabic Box 53, f. 61. The word saydani seems not to appear in a\ndictionary, but occurs twice in App. G, sec. 19, referring to different persons (TS\nMisc. Box 8, £. 102, col. I, 1. 16: Mubarak, ibid., col. 11, 1. 24: Aba Nasr b. Mukhtar).\nFor safafi see TS Misc. Box 8, f. 99, p. 6, col. VI, subcol. A, L. 5 (C 55).\n\nThe word saydalani is traditionally explained as dealer in sandalwood (the Eng-\nlish word goes back to the same Sanskrit name of that sweet-smelling wood as the\nArabic sandal, the common word for sandalwood). Thus, saydalani, like ‘attar,\noriginally designates a perfumer.\n\n3 Med. Soc., 1, 173-179, 364, sec. 11, where, in a contract of partnership, a special\nstipulation is made for a popular medicine helping women to get fat. A prescrip-\ntion how to become stout (“not only women, but men as well”) is found in the\nGeniza MS D. W. Amram, f. 2v, preserved in the Library of the University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia, (not in the Museum, like most of the other Genizm\nmanuscripts in the possession of the University). It is a genuine prescription, not\na cabbalistic one, as stated in 3. Halper, Descriptive Catalogue of Genizah Frag-\nments in Philadelphia (Philadelphia, 1924), p. 218, no. 456.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

I have the impression, rather, that\nhe was a Christian from a city not far away from Damascus, for only two, three, or,\nat most, four words are missing between the statement that “he left . . .” and\nanother saying that he fled “from them” to Damascus (1. 8), and in the next line\nwe read “they followed him.” His persecution by the Christian officials of Damascus\nand Jerusalem is also easier to understand if he was a native and therefore easily\nrecognizable (speaking the local Arabic vernacularl).\n\nTS 10 J 30, £.10v, 11, 3-7.

Supplement in HUCA, 38 (1968), 168-172.\nMy short article “Obadya, a Norman Prosclyte,” Journal of Jewish Studies, 4\n(1953), 74-84, in which I drew attention to TS 8.271, concluding that Obadiah was\nnot a Crusader, as formerly assumed, but a south Italian cleric, and encouraging\nsearch for the scroll in the literary sections of the Geniza set into motion a real\navalanche of publications. First, A. Scheiber identified the important fragment\nfrom the David Kaufmann Collection edited by him in the articles cited above.\nThen, N. Golb and A. Scheiber recognized that a liturgical text equipped with\nItalian musical notation (neumes) was in Obadiah’s handwriting. Another text\nwith neumes was identified by N. Allony in Cambridge. An unending discussion\nabout the nature of the music represented in these neumes ensued. fee N.

When I\nsaw it first, I noted: “Italian neumes, late” (i.e, of little value for me), a view\nshared by the eminent musicologist Eric Werner (sece Papers of Fourth World\nCongress of Jewish Studies, p. 406). But what seems unimportant to one scholar\nmay be most exciting for twenty others.

The work is remarkable for its sheer magni-\ntude, but more particularly for the humane sensibility and imagination, the skill, and the\nformidable learning that it reflects.”\n\nThe Haskins Medal Commictee\n\n“This is 2 most readable book. . . . A new vista of research has opened for the student\nof history of Mediterrancan countries during the Middle Ages. . . . An outstanding\naccomplishment.”\n\nHarry Poppers, American Historical Review\n\n“A truly remarkable achievement. . . . When we consider that [previously] consulting Geniza\nmaterials was possible only for the learned few, we may measurc the debt we all owe Goitein.\n. Given the exceptional importance of the Geniza and the unusual difficulties posed by its\ncontents, we understand how much we have been given.”\n_Jacob Newsnet, Journal of the Academy of Religion\n\n$.D.

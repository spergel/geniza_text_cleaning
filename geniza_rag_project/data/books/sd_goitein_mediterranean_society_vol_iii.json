        "text": "Preface\n\nWriting a book on the family these days is a risk. The confusion\nand controversy encompassing the contemporary family, and by\nno means the family of the Western World alone, have left their\nmark on the research going on in this field. Only a misanthrope,\nthough, would deny that we have made substantial progress in the\ntwentieth century in the mutual understanding between the sexes\nand different age groups, progress manifested in social experi-\nment, legislation, and practice. This favorable development has\nfound expression in, and was partly put into motion by, fertile\nthought, often distinguished by boldness and sophistication. Any-\none trying to find his place among the multitude of writers on the\nsubject is obliged to define clearly what kind of contribution he\nintends to make and what results may reasonably be expected from\nhis endeavors.\n\nThis volume undertakes to portray the Mediterranean family of\nthe High Middle Ages (tenth through thirteenth centuries) with\nthe aid of a great variety of letters and documents from that region\nand period, still largely unpublished. The authors of those writings\nwere mostly Jews who spoke Arabic, but usually wrote that lan-\nguage with Hebrew characters, although for certain specific pur-\nposes Hebrew, too, was used. All the material was originally found\nin Fustat, or Old Cairo, the ancient Islamic capital of Egypt, but it is\nnow dispersed in the libraries of many countries, predominantly\nEngland and the United States. The interested reader will find a\nfull description of the Cairo Geniza, as this treasure trove of manu-\nscripts is usually called, in the Introduction to the first volume of\nthis publication.\n\nThe systematic historical study of the medieval family is com-\nparatively new, even as far as Europe is concerned. For the coun-\ntries of Islam it has hardly begun. The Arabic-speaking Jews,\nnaturally, formed only a small section of the population in Islamic\ncountries, and an even smaller one of the Mediterranean region in\ngeneral. But they were old-timers, indigenous to that area, not\nnewcomers and foreigners like the Jews in the northern parts of\nEurope. On the southern shores of the Mediterranean there were\n\nGoitein, S.

In medieval France, Germany, and England the\nJews used Hebrew, not Latin, for written expression. In the Islamic\ncountries of the Mediterranean even the doctors of Jewish law\nwrote their legal opinions and court records in Arabic, and so did\nthe theologians, and, of course, the physicians and the students of\nthe sciences. In short, the writers of the Geniza papers may\nlegitimately be regarded as part and parcel of their environment,\nseparated from it, like their Christian neighbors, by a different\nreligious law and by a specific group ethos, which, as a social force,\nshould be compared with modern nationalism. Thus, with the\nlimitations just indicated, the material presented in this volume\nshould be valued not only as a contribution to the history of the\nJewish family, but also to that of the family within Mediterranean\nIslam at large, and, to some extent, even within the Mediterranean\narea in general.\n\nThe Geniza papers originated mostly in the middle and lower\nlayers of society, which makes them particularly valuable, since we\ndo not have much information about this, the main part of\nhumanity, from that period. That competitive and mobile world of\nhardworking merchants, craftsmen, lawyers, and physicians, de-\nscribed in volumes I and IT of this book, has much in common with\nour own society, and, therefore, is far less colorful and exotic than\nthat of the feudal lords, knights, and their ladies, monks, and\ntroubadours, who populate the medieval scene as commonly\nknown. But precisely for this reason—that is, the ordinary char-\nacter of urban Geniza society—the specific traits of its family life\nbecome an intriguing topic of inquiry: similar socioeconomic\nconditions do not necessarily create the same type of family.\n\nI have characterized the work carried out in this volume as “pre-\nsenting materials.” I have done so because I feel that I am still occu-\npied with spadework, with establishing the facts, as far as one can\ncull them out from documents often incompletely preserved and\ndifficult to understand. The facts presented are interpreted in the\nway the writers themselves saw them whenever they have made this\nknown to us. Often telling utterances are cited in full. Where the\nsources do not provide interpretative comments, I have tried to\nmake sense of the facts with the aid of my general knowledge of\nIslam and Judaism. Sometimes matters do not fall into focus, either\nbecause our information is insufficient or, perhaps, because life\nitself was not in focus, was variegated and even contradictory. The\nsociety presented in the Geniza records was by no mean homo-\n\nGoitein, S. D.

There were marked differences between the various\ncountries and, even more so, between the different layers of the\npopulation.\n\nThroughout the volume references to Islamic law and custom\nare given. Such occasional hints are made by way of illustration and\nshould by no means be taken as attempts at systematic compari-\nson. The time for that has not yet come since the preliminary\nstudies for an undertaking of that kind have not yet been made. 1\nshall be grateful to my fellow historians who explore the medieval\nsocieties on the northern shores of the Mediterranean for any\ncomparative comments they may care to make. I crave their\nindulgence for the few cases in which I trespass on their precincts.\nThis is also the place to thank David Herlihy of Harvard University\nfor his bibliographical hints to recent research on the medieval\nhistory of the family in Western Europe, to which he himself has\ncontributed so much.\n\nThe reader may wonder why the Jews of Yemen (now found\nmostly in Israel) are mentioned so often in this book. I have studied\nthem for many years because, on the one hand, they were most\nintensively arabicized, and, on the other, they probably presented\nthe traditional Jew in the purest form. Comparing and contrasting\nthe results of my fieldwork among them with the findings of the\nGeniza writings was quite illuminating. The Introduction to my\nTales from the Land of Sheba (New York: Schocken Books, 1973)\ngives an idea of this remarkable community.\n\nI have tried to keep the references to Jewish law to a reasonable\nminimum. I did so relying on my former student Mordechai A.\nFriedman, now Professor of Talmud and Jewish Law at Tel-Aviv\nUniversity, who has made the Geniza family, as seen in the context\nof the development of Jewish law and legal practice, the object of\nhis life work. Friedman has published numerous papers on the\nsubject, and his forthcoming book on the Geniza marriage con-\ntracts according to Palestinian custom is certain to be a major con-\ntribution. The Palestinian marriage contracts represent only a\nsmall fraction of the Geniza material relevant to family life, but\nFriedman’s treatment is so comprehensive that it illustrates many\naspects of medieval marriage (see Author’s Note).\n\nSome material bearing on family life had to be reserved for the\nfourth and concluding volume of this book. The trousseau lists,\nfound in the Geniza in abundance, provide countless details about\na bride’s jewelry, precious utensils, clothing, bedding, hangings,\ncopper vessels, and other household implements. This most valu-\nable information must be studied in connection with other Geniza\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Sexual\nmores are discussed there in the context of moral attitudes in\ngeneral. The reader of the present volume should not feel cheated.\nPlayboys, gays, and lesbians were not absent from the Geniza\nsociety, but they were not as vociferous as some of our con-\ntemporaries, wherefore I have not much to tell about them. The\nmore intimate aspects of marital symbiosis are, of course, touched\nupon repeatedly in the pages that follow. Finally, legal dispositions\nin contemplation of death naturally deal to a large extent with\nspouses, children, and other relatives. But they embrace many\nother matters. All the multifarious details included in wills reflect a\nman’s concern when approaching the end of his days, and conse-\nquently had to be treated as one single group.\n\nThe organization of the family had a tremendous influence on\neconomic life. Some considerations in this respect are offered in\nthe conclusion of B, 4 (“The Economic Foundations of Marriage”),\nC, 4 (“Heirs and Orphans”), and in D (“The World of Women™).\nAttention is also drawn to the Appendix (“The Economics of Mar-\nriage”). Beyond these, relevant material is to be found throughout\nthis volume, which might therefore serve, to a certain extent, as a\ncomplement to volume I of this book, which is subtitled Economic\nFoundations.\n\nA note on the purchasing power of the dinar, the gold coin\nmentioned on many pages, may be welcome. Because of the\nabysmal difference in living standards and the unstable character\nof our own money, a comparison with the dollar serves no purpose.\nA few examples of standard earnings gleaned from the Geniza\nmight do a better service. Emoluments of 2 dinars per month for a\nlower community official were regarded as appropriate. A master\nmason could make up to 4 dinars during the same period, if he\nworked seven days a week. An allowance of half a dinar per month\nfor a single person, such as a wife whose husband was abroad, was\ncommonplace.\n\nI feel obliged to make another technical observation. Since the\nvarious aspects of family life are closely intertwined, this volume is\nreplete with cross references. References are made to notes rather\nthan to pages, the reason being that often numerous notes occur on\none page and where a mere hint to a page might entail guesswork,\nthe note number, with the help of the running heads on both the\nnotes and the text, will guide the reader directly to the required\nreference.\n\nLeafing through this manuscript again I feel the general reader\n\nGoitein, S.

It was surrounded and influenced by a state and a\nsociety with laws and moral notions at variance with its own.\nMoreover, it displayed social and geographical mobility and evinced\ncreative flexibility in the conduct of its economic and public affairs.\nA community of this type cannot be expected to manifest a rigid\npattern of a family system, A composite and complex situation is to\nbe anticipated. No attempt is made here to place the family emerg-\ning from the Geniza documents within any defined sociological\ncategory.\n\nStill, some major features are clearly discernible, shared, it\nseems, by other societies around the Mediterranean.\n\nThe bonds of blood were stronger than the ties of marriage. A\nman’s family, foremost in his mind, was not the small one founded\nby himself but the larger one into which he was born. His family\nwas, as is said in so many documents, “the house of his father.” The\nterm “father” included the forefathers as well as the agnates.\n\nLaw favored the paternal family. The economic security of a\nwoman largely depended on what she had brought in from her\nfather’s (or “fathers’ ”*) house, and for her legal protection during\nher marriage she relied on him or on her brothers. Nor did she\ninherit from her husband. Although Islamic and Jewish laws\ndiffered considerably in some respects, both made special pro-\nvisions for the widow, but if a man had no issue his estate “re-\nturned”—in legal parlance—to his father’s house, and the wife’s\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "2 The Extended Family viii, A\n\ndowry, or, at least half of it, returned to her family when she died\nchildless. Legal practice—although not statutory law—and com-\nmonly accepted custom made the members of the extended family\nresponsible for one another. Finally, the widespread practice of\nmarrying close relatives, especially first cousins, had its origin not\nso much in economic considerations as in the belief that such\nunions would provide protection for the young couple, especially\nthe wife, and safeguards for the honor of the family.\n\nIn view of these social and psychological realities I treat the ex-\ntended family first. Biologically, of course, and, therefore, so to say,\nlogically, the nuclear, “natural,” family comes first. But factually\nand conceptually, the latter was an outgrowth of the “father’s\nhouse,” it was a branch of the tree, not its root.\n\nThe Arabic of the Geniza documents has two sets of designa-\ntions for the term “family,” some for the extended, and others for\nthe nuclear family.* Similarly, Hebrew mishpahd, “family,” refers,\nas a rule, to the extended family, usually one with a noble pedigree,\nthat is, one containing a number of distinguished personalities,\nsuch as high religious dignitaries, judges, scholars, government\nofficials, physicians, great merchants, or other persons of any walk\nof life who had been munificent or otherwise meritorious in the\nservice of the community. Hebrew bayit, “house,” may designate a\nman’s nuclear family or his wife, but the plural, in the phrase ba‘ale\nbattim, invariably describes the person concerned as the scion of a\ndistinguished (extended) family.?\n\n1. Honoring Ancestors and Agnates: Memorial Services\nand Family-oriented Names\n\nIn an intensely religious society man’s attitude toward his family\nmust be explored first through its place in religion. The Geniza\nreveals that reverence for his forefathers and for the past genera-\ntions of his family was paramount and found its regular expression\nin the synagogue service. As a rule, prayers for a person, alive\nor dead, were said, not for him alone, nor for him and his immediate\nrelatives, but first and foremost for his ascendants and noteworthy\nagnates, all male, to be sure, even when the person for whom the\nprayer was recited was a woman. We possess detailed knowledge\nabout these procedures in the numerous “memorial lists” preserved\nin the Geniza.!\n\nMemorial lists—The reading of these lists must have formed an\nimportant part of the synagogue service and taken considerable\n\nGoitein, S.

Here is a brief example: An “esteemed,\nchaste, and pious lady departed to her eternal abode with a good\nname and after having done good deeds” (we are not told her\nname); blessings were recited for her late father; an uncle, who had\ndied young in a foreign country; a grandfather, who had been a\njudge; and a great-grandfather, a notable. Then “life, wellbeing,\nhonor, and all the consolations written in the holy scriptures” were\nwished the mourners, namely, her husband and two sons, who\nwere present, a third son, out of town, and to other male rela-\ntives mentioned by name. The prayer concluded with blessings\nfor the congregation and above all for the Nagid, the head of the\ncommunity.?\n\nA similar service was held after the first month of mourning.

The principle of heredity of\npublic office, high or low, so thoroughly familiar to the Geniza\nworld (see Med. Soc., 11, 89—91, 161162, 319), was based on the\nsame assumption.

These were well-known or\notherwise meritorious persons and those whose life was cut short\ncither by an early natural death—a common occurrence—or by a\ndisaster such as the collapse of a house, drowning, shipwreck,\ndisappearance abroad, murder, or, especially, dying for God’s\nsake, that is, in a religious persecution. By remembering such\npersons, who often had died generations ago, they were, so to say,\nkept alive.'®\n\nAs a rule, a memorial list is superscribed with the name of the\nperson or family for whom it is composed. It opens with the first\nancestor who is often characterized as an important person, and is\nfollowed by his descendants for five to seven, but sometimes ten\nand more generations.

One of his own sisters\nwas married to one of them. Each of the brothers-in-law is listed in\nthe joint genealogy of the two families, with both the Hebrew and\nArabic forms of their names, but nowhere do we learn the names\nof Moses Maimonides’ wife or sister who created this union.' It\nmust be noted, however, that a man’s status in society depended on\nthe family of his mother no less than on that of his father. This is\nexpressly stated in letters and can be deduced from the memorial\nlists. “Ibn al-‘Ammani [a scion of a prominent Alexandrian family\nof physicians and public servants, see Med. Soc., 11, 245] wrote to\nmy brother a letter full of conceit, announcing that he had mar-\nried our paternal cousin—may God grant her happiness. Please tell\nhim that she was not honored through him, but he through her,\nnamely her pure and noble house, her ancestors from her mother’s\nside.”* In the genealogy of Mishael b. Isaiah, Maimonides’ father-\nin-law, first his mother’s lineage is provided through fourteen gen-\nerations because her family had played an important role in Pales-\ntine, as well as in Egypt, followed later by six generations of Mish-\nael’s paternal ancestors known as scholars, physicians, and public\nservants.'® In a doctor’s “itra, or pedigree, the mother’s lineage pre-\ncedes, because it included the Nagid Samuel b. Hananya, certainly\none of the most prominent figures in the history of Egyptian Jewry.\nThe first and last name in this lineage also was Samuel. The Karaite\nfamily name “Son of the daughter of Saul” also indicates that\nyikhas, or noble descent (Hebrew), could be transmitted through\na mother. But it is always a male person to whom her reputation\nand that of the family accrued. The woman appears solely as a link,\nas daughter and mother, and is not mentioned by name. When a\nfather of daughters is wished a son, it is said to him: “May God not\nwipe out the name of your fathers.”*\n\nThe absence from the genealogies of the names of women is\nconspicuous because women are constantly referred to.

It\nwould not be difficult to adduce other examples from the Geniza.\n\nNaming one’s firstborn son after his own father was a wonderful\nway to show him the filial piety that religion, Jewish, as well as\nMuslim, and of course Christian, imposes on us as a most holy duty.\n(“You have given life to me, I ensure the perpetuation of your\nname.”) We must remember that in those days young couples often\nlived in the father’s house, so that the old man had daily opportun-\nity to see himself continued and, as it were, perpetuated through\nhis namesake grandson. This idea occurred to me many years ago,\nwhen the Muslim sheikh, with whom I read Hadith (Muslim oral\ntraditions), wanted to show me his little grandson who played in the\ngarden; he shouted: Sidi, Sidi (“Grandpa”); when he saw my as-\ntonishment, he explained: “I love him; so I call him as he calls\nme.”?8\n\nIt seems that an additional, religious, element was involved in\nthis symbolic linking together of the generations. The Bible ad-\nmonishes: “Teach your sons and grandsons” (Deuteronomy 4:9),\nand “Peace over Israel” will be when “you see sons of your sons”\n(Psalm 128:4). To this the Talmud adds: when religious scholar-\nship is cultivated by father, son, and grandson, “the Torah will\nfrequent its lodgings,” that is, religiosity will stay firmly rooted in\nthe family.” Hence the interest of the grandfather in the studies\nof his grandsons. When ‘Amid al-Dawla (“Support of the Govern-\nment”), a high official, returned from a trip, the first thing for him\nto do was to examine his grandson, who, to judge by the reading\nmatter he had covered, must have been a mere child; the old man\nwas highly pleased with the boy’s attainments, at least so his teacher\nreported.*\n\nThe history of naming also seems to indicate that religion had\nsomething to do with the custom of naming a child after an an-\ncestor or agnate. It was unknown in biblical times. Not a single\nking of Judah or high priest in the First Temple of Jerusalem is\ncalled by the name of an ancestor. In the genealogies of pre-\nIslamic and early Islamic Arab tribes and clans, which we have in\nthe hundreds, a name is repeated in only a few exceptional cases,\nand then it usually has a characteristic byname to distinguish it\nfrom the first occurrence.®\n\nGoitein, S.

When the Seleu-\ncids of Syria and the Ptolemaeans of Egypt, successors of Alex-\nander the Great, who alternately held sway over Palestine, named\ntheir sons after themselves or their fathers, and later the Roman\nconquerors were observed to do the same, we find that the high\npriests of Jerusalem, and later the Hasmonaean kings and high\npriests, followed suit.* In the pedigree of the “patriarchs” of\nJudea the name Gamaliel (known also from the New Testament,\nActs 22:3) recurs six times, to be followed in frequency by those of\nJudah, Simeon,* and Hillel. How far the common people followed\nthis example, we cannot say. When the custom of naming a boy\nafter his grandfather or another ancestor or agnate became stan-\ndard practice in Geniza times, in addition to strong family attach-\nment a religious element was present: “The Torah frequents its\nlodgings.”\n\nIn Islam something similar to what we have observed in Judaism\nis to be found. The endlessly repeated names from the holy history\nof Islam replaced the onomastic inventiveness of Arab antiquity. I\ndo not see, however, that the Muslims had developed a system of\nrotating names within the family comparable with what we have in\nthe Geniza. I scrutinized the genealogies of fifty Islamic authors\nfrom the High Middle Ages and found that only four bore the\nsame name as their grandfathers, two, of their fathers, and two of\ntheir great-grandfathers, and these were ordinary names such as\nMuhammad, Ahmad, ‘Ali, and Husayn. Of fifty persons signing a\ndocument in Aswin, Egypt, in 948, and mentioning the names of\ntheir grandfathers, only nine were named after them and again\nwith names of the character just described.** Thus the custom of\nnaming a child after his grandfather seems to have been more con-\nsistent in the Jewish family than in the Mushm family of the day.*®\n\nNaming a son after his own father, living or dead, was not un-\nknown in Geniza times. But it was incomparably less common than\nthe naming after the grandfather. This difference, like the cus-\ntomary memorial service, seems to be an indication of a certain\nprecedence of the extended over the nuclear family. Young\nparents of the 1970s, when choosing names for their newborn,\nusually pay no attention to either. This, too, teaches us something\nabout the importance of onomastics for the understanding of a\nman’s attitude toward his family.\n\nSurnames.—Family names in the strict sense of the word were\nknown in Talmudic times and it was assumed that they might be\npreserved even through ten generations.

Scribes list their ancestors in their colophons, 1 suppose,\nbecause they had inherited their art from them. Our analysis of\nthe Geniza data on the Ibn Bagara family has also told us some-\nthing about its history. Like many natives of Tunisia, Abraham II,\nor his father, left his country in the course of the eleventh century\nand settled in Egypt. In the sack of Qayrawan of 1057 the riches\nof the family had vanished, and what had been an avocation for\nhis ancestors became a profession for the emigrant. He derived\nhis livelihood from the copying of books, one of the worst-paid\noccupations in those days.\n\nThe surname Ibn Kammiuna, “Son of the Grain of Cumin\n[fem.),” which sounds even stranger than “Son of the Cow,” is quite\nanother story. It appears first in the Geniza in the year 1121, in a\nreport about messianic troubles in Baghdad, when an Aba Sahl Ibn\nKammiina was received by the caliph and intervened with him for\nthe Jewish community.”” Another Ibn Kammiina, clearly a promi-\nnent personality, died in an underground prison in Wisit, Iraq, in\n1204/5, reported by a Muslim historian as a noteworthy hap-\npening.” A third one, bearing the title “Pride of the Efficient\n[servants of the government],” is referred to as a benefactor in a\nletter by the Gaon of Baghdad, Samuel b. Eli, dated 1206.” All\nthese as well as the famous oculist and philosopher 1zz al-Dawla\n[bn Kammiina, one of the most interesting authors of the Jewish\nMiddle Ages (d. 1284), might have belonged to the same family.\nFor all of them lived in Iraq and were connected with the govern-\nment in one way or another.

Connecting links may still be\nfound.®\n\nWhile very specific names were borne by different families, it was\nequally common for ordinary names to form the distinctive marks\nof families represented in the Geniza throughout the centuries. For\ninstance, Andalusi, “Native of Muslim Spain,” was a frequently\nfound surname. Still, one Andalusi family, with headquarters in\nQayrawan, Tunisia, was prominent in the business correspondence\nthroughout the eleventh century.® The manufacture of sugar was\na favorite Jewish occupation, wherefore the name Sukkari, “Sugar-\nmaker,” was widespread. Yet, one Sukkari clan, active in Fustat\n(and working in the mint and as merchants, but not as sugar-\nmakers), is well attested in documents and letters. The first known\nmember, who lived in the tenth century, was known as Ben al-\nSukkari (“Son of the Sugarmaker”).* In short, while doing research\non the families of the Geniza, we should not disregard the\nsurnames, but can make use of them only if their occurrence is\naccompanied by additional corroborating information.\n\nThe “illustrious houses.”—Three types of families tended to per-\npetuate themselves by adhering to the same profession or by adopt-\ning one of similar status: (1) tamilies of religious dignitaries and\nscholars, both high in rank, such as judges and heads of the ye-\nshivas,® and lower in rank, such as cantors, scholars, and scribes;*\n(2) powerful merchant houses, such as the Tahertis of Qayrawan;*\nand (3) government officials and purveyors, as well as physicians,\nwho often treated rulers and governors and thus were close to the\nseats of power.*\n\nNaturally, the three types interchanged occupations freely. Since\njudges and cantors frequently engaged in commercial activities, it\nwas no wonder that their sons might prefer business to a learned\nprofession altogether.

Moses II returned to his great-\ngrandfather’s profession and became a doctor.*\n\nWhether the family in the poorer sections of the population was\nequally cohesive in adhering to the same profession or one of\nsimilar status is difficult to say at this stage of research. An an-\nalysis of the preserved communal lists has shown that, as a rule,\nindigent families were smaller than middle class families, the rea-\nson being that the boys had to leave the home of their parents at a\nvery tender age in order to earn a livelihood wherever they could\nfind it.** In general, the exigencies and stresses of economic life\nhad a decisive influence on the formation and structure of families.\nThe basic concepts about family represented one set of motiva-\ntions, the economic realities quite another.\n\nThe vertical aspect of the extended family, that is, the immense\nsignificance of the patriarchs and agnates, as documented in the\nGeniza papers, was nothing exceptional. Ancestor worship was one\nof the foundations of the high civilizations of the ancient Mediter-\nranean world, such as those of Hellas and Rome.* The veneration\nof the forefathers, entailing widespread knowledge of genealogy,\nwas the backbone of pre-Islamic Arab tribal organization. There is\nalso no need to point to the central position of the idea of “the\nmerit of the fathers” in postbiblical Jewish religiosity.** The Geniza\nletters show that this notion was fully alive in the High Middle\nAges, referring not only to the ancestors of the community but also\nto those of the person addressed, including his mother. A strong\nsense of the duty “to make good mention” of dead relatives,\nespecially those whose lives were cut short, was also very much\npresent and is to be understood within the general concepts about\ndeath, future life, and resurrection. It seems, however, that the\nsocial aspect was equally strong. “Man’s success depends on his\nsocial position,” as a Geniza letter has it, and this was largely pre-\ndetermined by his origins, by the prominence, meritoriousness,\nand renown of his ancestors and agnates.*\n\n2.

The famous lines written by Moses\nMaimonides about his brother David eight years after he perished\nin the Indian Ocean have often been quoted. I have translated\nthem in full in my Lettess of Medieval Jewish Traders (p. 207), and the\nreader will find there also the beautifully informal and personal\nletter that David wrote to his illustrious brother from an east\nAfrican port immediately before embarking on his ill-fated voyage.\n\nLabrat I b. Moses I Ibn Sighmar, judge in al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia,\nhad a younger brother, Judah, who, like many other young men in\nthat country, emigrated to Egypt and had some initial difficulties in\nadjusting himself to the new environment. The judge had given\nhim some very outspoken instructions, both directly and through\nhis learned friend Nahray b. Nissim, who had emigrated to Egypt\nbefore. Here is the sequence of this correspondence. The first\npassage translated is from a very long letter, which opens with most\njoyful congratulations on the birth of Judah’s first son:\n\nYou wrote, dear brother, that you were much distressed by my words of\nreproach. But we only criticize the ones we love, and if not you, whom is\nthere that I should criticize? Have I not sworn to you time and again that\nyou are not only my brother, but both my younger brother and my eldest\nson?> When will this little boy whom I made soil his feet [i.e., whom I sent\non errands] and whom I punished for his misdeeds, be grown up? . . . For\nall the world I would not have misunderstandings come between you and\nme. . .. You are dearer to me than the world and all that is in it.?\n\nAnd to the common friend sojourning in Egypt: “As to my words\nof excuse for my elder son and younger brother—God knows that\nhe is dearer to me than my own soul. In fact, no blame comes to\nhim at all. Only because of my exaggerated love for him have 1\nused some strong words against him.\"”\n\nAbout another brother, however, the judge wrote this: “In these\ndays, because of my sins, I have become totally solitary. Our\nbrother, may God keep him—you know the lowness of his char-\nacter and nature. My attitude toward him mostly is not to have\nanything to do with him and to regard him as a complete stranger.\nThese days, however, although the way caused me hardship, I went\nto Sasa to attend his wedding.”®\n\nGoitein, S.

The idea\nunderlying this expression is that just as close relatives must be\nprepared to stand up for each other in civil life, so must they be\nready to bear the misfortunes that God has apportioned to their\nbeloved—although the Psalmist (49:8) has clearly stated that God\ndoes not accept one brother as a substitute for another. This\nimplies also that a man must be prepared to take upon himself the\nresponsibility for his brother’s misdeeds, a trait for which examples\nare to be found in the Geniza correspondence.?\n\nOccasionally the phrase “may I be your ransom” is used in letters\nexchanged between persons who apparently are not relatives\n(although we never can be sure about this point) by which the\nwriter wishes to emphasize that he belongs to the family of the\naddressee signifying that he has a claim on the other’s support or\nprotection.'®\n\nOne kisses the hands of an elder brother.\" If the addressee is\nyounger, then the sons of the writer would kiss their uncle’s hands\nand, if he was a scholarly person, even his feet, although the latter\nexpression of reverence is not common in the classical Geniza\nperiod.'* “My brother, master and lord,” or “crown of my head” is\nthe minimum of respect paid to a brother in a letter.\" Longing was\nexpressed by the usual phrases, such as “we are well and miss\nnothing except the look of your beloved face.” Around the holidays\nthe wording became stronger and more specific, for the holidays\nwere the great occasions for family reunions.'*\n\nWith the exception of these and similar phrases letters ex-\nchanged between brothers or other close relatives on business,\nprivate, or public affairs were not different from the corres-\npondence of persons unconnected by family ties. As a rule, one\nwrote for a practical purpose, not for pouring out one’s heart. This\nattitude is well expressed in the letter of a man from Alexandria\nthanking his two brothers in the capital for 10 dirhems they had\nsent to his mother and sisters living with him:\n\nI was told that you had complained of not having had a letter from me\nfor a long time.

A dead\nbrother would be honored by a decorative wood panel bearing his\nname, placed in the synagogue, or by a Torah scroll donated to it,\nenshrined in a silver case, on which the donor would have\nengraved his own name and that of the deceased. In the cases of\nmourring and joy, such as wedding weeks and circumcision\ncelebrations, services were held in family homes.**\n\nThe firstborn son occupied a privileged position. In the opening\nof letters he is often addressed together with his father, while his\nbrothers are referred to only by number or in general.?® Although\nthe kunya, or honorific byname, had long before become stereo-\ntyped and was given even to a child at birth, it had not lost its\noriginal function of teknonymic, that is, parents calling themselves\nproudly father and mother of their firstborn. Thus in a letter, the\nfirstborn Samuel “and his brother” are greeted, while the ad-\ndressee’s wife is referred to as “Mother of Samuel.”® Even when\nthe name of the firstborn was not mentioned, one would write:\n“Kindest regards to your boys, especially to your eldest.”’ Paying\nrespect to primogeniture apparently was good form.\n\nAccording to Jewish, but not Islamic, law, the firstborn also\nenjoyed economic prerogatives. This discrepancy between the two\nlaws created delicate situations (see Med. Soc., 11, 389—390).\n\nBrothers and sisters—The relationship between brothers and\nsisters did not differ in many respects from those between male\nsiblings.

Men could repudiate their wives, and\noften did so, but a sister was a lifelong responsibility. The noble\nbrother was the rock on which the security of a woman rested. A\nJewish woman from Yemen explained to me her situation by using\nthese words: “A husband—I can get; children—I can bear; but a\nnoble brother—from where shall I get him?”* This saying must\nhave been widely used, for when I mentioned it in passing in a\ncolloquium held in Salerno, Italy, in June 1973, a colleague from\nthe Oriental Institute of Naples remarked that he had often heard\nit from his old mother, a native of the province of Lucania in\nsouthern Italy. The idea behind the saying has an age-old history.\nHerodotus tells us about a woman who, given the choice by the\nPersian king Darius of whose life should be spared, that of her\nhusband, her children, or her brother, chose her brother, and for\nthe same reason, namely, that ke was irreplaceable.® In a famous\npassage of Sophocles’ Antigone the heroine declares that she acted\nagainst the laws of the ruler of the city by burying her dead\nbrother, a transgression that she would not have committed for\nother relatives.”” Readers familiar with Arabic letters remember that\nthe dirges that gained fame in pre-Islamic Arabia were those\ndedicated by women poets to their brothers, not to their husbands.\nThe root of all this is that, even after marriage a woman remains,\nto some extent a member of her paternal family. A married woman\nsays to her brother’s wife in a north Palestinian Arab village, “You\ncannot prevent me from taking food from my brother’s stores. It is\nnot your money and not even his. I eat from my father’s\npossessions.”?\n\nThe few examples given show that the brother-sister syndrome\nwas not confined to Egypt or to the orbit of Islamic civilization, but\nis a human experience well attested in the countries of the\nMediterranean and the Near East. A selection from the rich\nmaterial on the question preserved in the Geniza will demonstrate\nhow it worked during the High Middle Ages.*\n\n“My brother is an unsocial, bashful young man\"—with these\nwords a woman submitting a boldly worded complaint against her\nhusband to the Nagid Samuel b.

The oldest letter preserved, still written in Aramaic (eighth\ncentury?), is addressed by a sister to “my beloved and cherished\nbrother, my hope and trust, my salvation from distress.” When a\nyoung Tunisian, looking for work in Egypt, sends home to Qay-\nrawdn two rather detailed, but almost identical, letters, one to his\nparents and one to his sister, the latter can be understood only as\nan act of fraternal love or as compliance with etiquette.®® A\nremarkable letter of condolence written by a brother to his learned\nsister Rayyisa on the occasion of the death of their old mother\nbetrays a dedication which had only deepened with the years.*® The\neasygoing talk of an elder sister writing to her brother in Egypt\nshows indeed that it was expected that a brother write to his sister\nin addition to his immediate family.” Presents should accompany\nthe fraternal message.

The father, as we learn from many deathbed declarations\nproviding for small children, often died young. It was the brother\nwho accompanied his sister through life: he had to look after her in\nher orphaned childhood, he was bound to provide her with\neverything needed for her marriage, and, at old age, admitted her\nto his household, when, as a widow or divorcée, she had nowhere\nelse to go. Engagement contracts and other documents show that,\neven in a father’s lifetime, a brother often would represent his sister\nin the negotiations leading to the marriage. A variety of specific\ncircumstances, such as the age or health of the father, might have\nbeen involved in each particular case. But this certainly was also a\nmatter of decorum. Commenting on the story of Rebekah (Genesis\n24:50), where her brother Laban, and not her father, confers with\nthe messenger of her suitor, Abraham Maimonides (1186—1237)\nremarks: “As is well known, fathers feel embarrassed about per-\nsonally dealing with the marriage of their daughters.”*\n\nThe brother-sister relationship was by no means a one-way\naffair. In many cases, a married woman was economically stronger\nthan her agnates and could serve them as a pillar of refuge. By\ncharacter or other circumstances she might enjoy a position of\ninfluence within the family, and, even beyond, and thus be able to\nintervene in disputes between her relatives. Finally, the code of\nhonor demanded that a person possessing authority or power\nshould harken to the cry of help of a woman, especially a noble\none, wherefore a sister was the natural intercessor for her brother.\n\n“If I do not apply to you, to whom should I? It is up to you to\nspare us humiliation and to extricate us from our plight.” With\nthese words a former official of the mint in Cairo who had been\nreduced to abject poverty appeals to his sister.*® The most detailed\ndescription of exceptionally cruel, prolonged, and repeated tor-\ntures found in the Geniza is addressed to a sister, with the aim, of\ncourse, to elicit her compassion and financial help.*” That such calls\nfor support were not in vain is proved by numerous documents,\neven those related to women from less well-to-do families than\nthose addressed in the two letters just cited. In order to help her\nbrother a woman sold her maidservant, which she was not per-\nmitted to do, since the girl was part of the dowry (and consequently\nher husband’s responsibility); the price obtained was 10% dinars,\nabout half the standard price.** Another woman gave to her\n\nGoitein, S.

The surname was acquired even when the uncle was still\nalive.

The marriage with the father’s brother’s daughter\n(FBD) is attested over twice as frequently as that with the mother’s\nbrother’s daughter (MBD). This difference is perhaps partly to be\nexplained by the fact that we have much patrilineal, but little\nmatrilineal, information; the father, and occastonally also the\ngrandfather of the bride and bridegroom are noted, but their\nmothers only in exceptional cases. Still the testimony of the Geniza\ndoes indeed reflect the actual situation: marriages with the FBD\nwere common practice; bint ‘amm, daughter of the paternal uncle,\nin Arabic means a wife.\n\nMarriage with the first cousin, especially with the FBD, is a\nwidely diffused social institution, found far beyond the confines of\nthe Arabian world. A comprehensive discussion of this phenome-\nnon is provided in a recent publication by Paul Bourdieu surveying\nthe latest literature on the subject and dealing specifically with\nKabyle ethnology. A critical appraisal of research in this field,\nwritten by the anthropologist Richard L. Antoun, has just ap-\npeared.” And a study on the subject carried out in the 1960s by\nHarvey Goldberg among Tripolitanian Jews is illuminating. It\nshould also be noted that marriage between first cousins, although\nprohibited by most Orthodox churches, is permitted and widely\npracticed in the main Christian community of Egypt, the Copts. We\nare concerned here with the problem of why the urban society of\ncraftsmen, merchants, and professionals speaking to us through\nthe Geniza should adhere to this matrimonial system with the same\ntenacity as a tribal peasant or pastoral population.™\n\nTo be sure, Abraham, the father of the Jewish faith, saw to it that\nhis son Isaac should marry a girl from his family; Rebekah, Isaac’s\nwife, was a daughter of his first cousin; Jacob, Isaac’s son, was sent\nby his parents to woo a cousin (Genesis 28:2). He won two, Rachel\nand Leah; and when Ruth was married to a man from her dead\nhusband’s kin, she was blessed with the wish that she might become\nlike Rachel and Leah “who built the house of Israel” (Book of Ruth\n4:11). This blessing, naturally, was used in Geniza letters conveying\ngood wishes for a wedding.™ Nowhere, however, does marriage\nwith relatives appear as religiously motivated. Nor can the eco-\nnomic factors have been decisive. We do hear of properties united\nby marriage,”™ but any woman not related to the family would bring\nin houses and other valuables as dowry, receive them as gifts, or\ninherit them. Thus the main incentive for the proliferation of\nmarriages with cousins and other close relatives must have been\nattributable to the role of the extended family and to the notion\n\nGoitein, S. D.

But because of our lack of matrilineal\ninformation we do not read much about them. Here is an example:\na father had left a maidservant to his two married daughters who\nlived in one house, most probably also given to them by their\nfather. When one of the daughters died, her husband inherited\none-half of the legal rights on that girl, but gave it to his son, when\nhe married his cousin, the daughter of his father’s sister-in-law. She\nin turn gave the other half to her daughter.®\n\nMention has been made before of two sisters married to broth-\ners, and of a father wishing to marry his two daughters to his\nnephews.® By chance documents showing two sisters actually\nmarried to brothers have been preserved.*® From a passage in a\nletter from David to Moses Maimonides I conclude that their wives\nwere sisters.®* Such occurrences were not more frequent than they\nare in our own society, and there is nothing specifically noteworthy\nabout them.\n\nIt is well known that a sister of Maimonides was married to one\nof his five brothers. I looked for similar arrangements in the\nGeniza documents, but did not find any. No wonder. “Exchange\nmarriages,” as they are called in various Arabic vernaculars, were\nand are common in societies living according to Arabic tribal, not\nIslamic religious, law. In the former, the father gets the mahr, or\nnuptial gift, in the latter the bride does. One “exchanges” the\ndaughters, in order to save the payment of the mahr. When the\nbride is the recipient, as in Islamic and Jewish laws, no such saving\ncan be made. Maimonides’ case was exceptional. Similar cases\noccur, albeit rarely, in our own society.\n\n1 should like to conclude this survey with two examples of\nendogamy preceding and following the “classical” Geniza period,\nbut belonging to the same cultural milieu. The scene of the first is\nsouthern Italy in the later part of the ninth century. Shefatya, a\nscholar and writer of religious poetry, also a rich and powerful\nman, had a beautiful and lovely daughter whom ke wished to marry\noff, but his wife stalled: she would give her only to a man as\nlearned and prosperous as her own husband. One night Shefatya\ngot up to pray and to write poetry. When Cassia, his daughter,\nheard this, she rushed out of her bed, brought water, and poured it\nover her father’s hands—as was obligatory before prayer. Observ-\ning Cassia in her nightgown, her father realized that she was a ripe\nwoman and became very angry with himself, and, of course, also\n\nGoitein, S. D.

But now Shefatyd was resolved not to wait any longer\nand said so to his wife. In the morning, after the synagogue service,\nhe told his brother, summoned the entire congregation to his\nhouse, and the betrothal was enacted. The great-great-great-\ngrandson of Cassia, who tells us this story in his family chronicle,\ndoes not find it necessary to notify us when the young couple were\ninformed about their fathers’ decision or how they took it. He only\nsupplies us with the title of the religious poem which her brother\nAmittay wrote for the occasion (we still have the poem).*\n\nOur second example is less dramatic, but connected with one of\nthe most famous personalities of the later Jewish Middle Ages,\nR. Isaac Luria, the great cabalist of the sixteenth century. When his\nfather died, his mother was invited by her rich brother to stay with\nhim in Cairo. Isaac consented to follow her because only his uncle\nwould be able to provide him with the books needed for his studies.\nHe was a child prodigy confounding all the wise men of Egypt with\nhis wisdom. At the age of fifteen he was married to his uncle’s\ndaughter. This is what his biography, which, naturally, bears\nlargely the character of a hagiography, has to tell us. But there is no\nreason to doubt the detail about his marriage, which is confirmed\nby other sources.®®\n\nThe survey presented above seems to show that endogamy was\npracticed at all times and by all professional groups and sections of\nthe population represented in the Geniza. It also reveals the fact\nthat close relationship was no panacea for achieving happiness in\nmarriage. We have read about engagements dissolved, hardship,\nand even utmost misery in marriages with a cousin, as well as about\ndivorce. But endogamy was a fact of life, based on strong social\nconvictions.\n\n3.

Moreover, both the government and public opinion\nwere prone to hold a father, or brother, or an even more distant\nrelative responsible for a man’s commitments, although strict law,\nboth Islamic and Judaic, did not recognize such a claim.

        "text": "34 The Extended Family viii, A, 3\n\nwidening of the family concept was counter-balanced by the\nindividualistic spirit of the time, the fervent insistence of nearly\neveryone on his full rights.\n\nBefore going into details, I should like to illustrate this situation\nof the Geniza family by three ordinary examples. A father writes\nfrom a Sudanese port to his son in Alexandria sending him the\ngoods acquired there and leaving it largely to him how to deal with\nthem. The son is admonished to take good care of his mother, his\nwife, and his boys, but receives only one tenth of the profit made\nfrom the goods sent, and this after some advance lump deduction\nfor the father. Thus, the married son might live with his parents\nunder one roof, but property is not shared in common; he is not\neven a partner of his father, but receives a kind of commission like\nan agent. The maternal uncles of the writer and their sons as well\nas his aunt’s son greeted in the letter might have lived on other\nfloors of the same house or close by.!\n\nThe troubles caused by agnates—but endured with resignation—\nare vividly brought home in a letter from Alexandria, addressed to\nthe sons of a dead sister in the capital. The writer must have had a\nnumber of children, for he reports the death of the youngest, a\nboy, only in passing, adding drily: “May God preserve the rest.”\nTwo aged sisters lived with him, together with an orphan boy from\na niece whose recent death is also reported. Another niece staying\nwith him had a suitor whom she could not marry because she was a\ndivorcée and had not received the legal documents needed for the\nnew marriage. The main purpose of the letter to the nephews was\nto secure the missing papers (perhaps one of them had been\nmarried to the unhappy woman). As though that were not enough:\ntwo sisters of those nephews lived in a house belonging to their\nfamily in Alexandria. The house was maysham, ill-omened, proba-\nbly because someone had been killed there, or had died an\nunnatural or premature death. No one came to visit the girls, and\nthey lived in complete solitude, “the most miserable creatures in\nthe entire city with no one to care for them.” The writer was\nprepared to invite these nieces to stay with him, but their brother\nwould not permit them to move, probably in order to have\nsomeone to look after the property. Having already beenill for five\nmonths, during which time he was able to go out to the bazaar only\nonce, the writer had entrusted one of the sons of his dead sister\nwith some of his business, but he had completely wrecked it.\n“The complaint is to God alone” (for what can one do against a\nclose relative?). Several other relatives are mentioned in the letter\nin a rather sarcastic vein.?\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Sill the urge, and almost moral\nobligation, that the members of a family should live close to one\nanother was strongly felt—as was the opposite and more modern\nendeavor to escape from the supervision and encroachment of\nrelatives. Both tendencies are amply documented in the Geniza.\nThe situation within another Jewish society inside Islamic civiliza-\ntion, a society of more recent date, but perhaps more pristine\ncharacter, might serve as a backdrop.\n\nIn a recently published autobiography, a Yemenite octogenari-\nan, Joseph Hubarih, gives an account of the resettlement of his\nfamily, after the Jews had been pillaged and expelled from\nSan‘a, the capital of Yemen, in 1679 and temporarily banished to\nthe unhealthy coast of the Red Sea. On the land outside the city\nacquired by the exiled after their return, the Hubariéhs, like the\nother families, settled together and erected in the course of time a\ndouble row of houses including a synagogue bearing their name.\nAt the time of the exodus in 1950, nine houses, one adjoining\nanother, were still owned by Hubarihs; the others had been sold or\nabandoned. Thus propinquity of domicile as an expression of\nfamily coherence had endured for 270 years. It stands to reason\nthat it had existed within the city walls of San‘a for centuries\nbefore. The Hubarihs were one of the minor Jewish families in the\ncity. A look at a map of the Jewish town shows that, with a few\nexceptions, each of the twenty-eight or so synagogues and the\nsurrounding streets were named after families, all well known and\nstill extant.®\n\nNo such synagogues and streets are found in the Geniza docu-\nments. The twin capitals of Egypt were not the scene of mass\ndislocations and resettlements, as happened in San‘a both before\nand in the wake of the temporary expulsion of the Jews from the\nHigh Yemen in 1679, which made compact clannish domiciles\npossible. Fustat was originally a Byzantine fortress, inhabited by\nChristians and Jews, and enlarged by an Arab tribal camp-city, into\nwhich ever new trickles of immigrants infiltrated. Cairo, it is true,\nwas newly founded but, like Baghdad, was conceived from the\noutset as the seat of the court, the central administration, and the\ncaliphal guards. Of the civil population only persons directly\nconnected with the court, such as higher officials, purveyors, and\ncourt physicians, were admitted at the beginning. A document, by\nchance preserved outside the Geniza, tells us that the synagogue in\nthe newly founded city was surrounded on all sides by houses\nbelonging to one family of court physicians who had come o Egypt\n\nGoitein, S.

The houses were in the Zawila\nquarter of Cairo and probably were acquired or erected by the\nfamily when they moved from the old to the new capital. They also\npossessed shares in a house in Fustat. Of these the dying man gave\none sixth of the house to his older sister, a widow, and one twelfth\nto the son of a brother, both of whom certainly held other shares in\nthe same house.\"\n\nIn a fragmented document from Damascus, Syria, a man gives a\nhouse “on the side of my house” to a person with a different family\nname, presumably a son-in-law. The incompletely preserved de-\nscription seems to suggest that the two houses were interconnected.”\n\nNeedless to say, Muslim family attachment took similar forms.\nWhen a Jew acquired from a Muslim two neighboring abandoned\nbuildings, it seerns likely that they had been occupied by various\nmembers of an extended family which had moved elsewhere.\nWhen we read, however, of the mansion of a Muslim merchant in\nBaghdad, destroyed by flood, which comprised thirty separate\nbuildings as well as a garden and a bathhouse, we must remember\nthat a large section of the Muslim population of the Iraqian capital\nwas created by the influx of bedouins to whom a multi-domicile\nmansion was but an urban tent-camp of a clannish type.*!\n\nUseful information about the living quarters of an extended\nfamily may be derived from the lists of contributors to public\nappeals as analyzed in Med.

In many cases the\nsponsors clearly went from house to house and from one bazaar to\nthe next, and in their lists it is frequently evident that fathers and\nsons, brothers, and other relatives lived close to one another or in\nthe same house. Number 55 on page 492 is a good example.\n\nSince the Mediterranean house of the Geniza period, even in\nprovincial towns, often consisted of several stories, it was the\nnatural domicile for several branches of an extended family.\nExamples are provided in this book in many different contexts.\nThe origins of joint living were of the greatest imaginable variety.\nA father gives an entire house to his two sons because he wishes\nthem to stay together; the house consisted of two stories with a\nmezzanine in between; the gift was in two equal shares, but the\ndocument defines specifically the parts that belonged to each of the\ntwo.”* But when we find two brothers, government officials in\nDamascus, living together in a mansion, we may properly assume\n\nGoitein, S.

When a father gave to his daughter one half of a\nhouse newly erected by him, he clearly reserved the other half for\nhimself or another branch of his family.** How the arrangement\nworked in practice may be seen from a detailed will written at\napproximately the same time: In order to attract 2 desirable mate\nfor a young daughter who was widowed and had a son, her father\ngave her a large house (as it is called in the document); he stipu-\nlated only that he and his wife, as well as his son with his family,\nshould have the right to occupy the uppermost story as long as they\nlived.

In\ngeneral, letters to relatives may express the ardent wish to be\nunited with them “in one locality and in one house, so that we should\nsee one another all the time.”*\" A more modern tendency which\nregarded separate living quarters as more conducive to good\nfamily relations is discernible in the Geniza papers. The tension\nbetween the two attitudes is evident in the conditions on domicile\nagreed upon between a young couple, or imposed on it, at mar-\nriage und in marital disputes on this question and the legal\nsettlements intended to terminate them.?*\n\nJoint undertakings and responsibilities,—A similar contrast is to be\nobserved in other economic and legal matters. Since a son normally\nfollowed the occupation of his father and apprenticed with him or,\nin his absence, with an uncle or brother, occupational cooperation\nbetween a father and his grown-up sons, between brothers, be-\ntween an uncle and his nephew or nephews, or between cousins\nwas natural, and examples for all such unions are found in the\nGeniza. But which legal form such cooperation assumed is rarely\nstated expressly. When two washers of the dead, father and son,\nadmitted a partner to their funeral business, conceding him a\nquarter of the proceeds, they appear as one party to the contract,\nbut what the arrangements were within the family we do not know.%\nWhen two brothers, having inherited part of a sugar factory\nfrom their father, acquired the other part from their brothers, the\nother heirs, and then took in two investors as partners, they formed\none contracting party. There might, or might not, have existed\nanother document showing how the brothers divided work, operat-\ning expenditure, and profits among themselves.* We are inclined\nto assume as a matter of course that they had indeed made legal\narrangements to this effect. But this is by no means sure. The\ndetailed description in Med. Soc., 1, 180, of a partnership between\nan uncle and his sister’s son in the very considerable sum of 3,750\ndinars (worth about half a million dollars) shows that it was\nconducted for years without any formal agreement, and when one\nwas finally made, it was of extreme latitude, leaving to the partners\ncomplete freedom of action, but making them fully responsible for\none another.

Those merchants did, of course, make\naccounts, but insisted to be regarded as absolutely trustworthy “like\ntwo witnesses whose testimony is accepted in court” and who are\nnot obliged to prove their depositions by accounts. Such a stipula-\ntion was of decisive importance in case one of the partners died and\nheirs appeared making claims.*\n\nWe encounter quite a different type of partnership between an\nuncle and his sister’s son in a notary’s entry where a nephew puts\n26 dinars into his uncle’s bank, to be used as loans against\ncollateral. The uncle receives 13 out of 24 shares of the profit, the\nnephew the remaining 11 shares. Originally, profit was to be\nshared in equal parts. But the uncle pushed hard and the condition\nwas changed in his favor. Losses were to be borne by both equally.\nThese conditions were exceptionally bad for the investor and\nparticularly revolting, because the profit was to be paid to the\nnephew’s mother during his absence on travel, that is, to the uncle’s\nsister. No wonder that such an agreement was registered with a\nnotary. We see that it was not the size of the capital involved, but\nthe character and relationship of the persons concerned which\nmade formal and tight legal arrangements between relatives\nnecessary.*®\n\nLeafing through the documents translated in my Letters of\nMedieval Jewish Traders the reader repeatedly comes across com-\nmercial cooperation, representing a firm, or a formal partnership,\nor informal mutual services between fathers and sons (nos. 7, 40,\n57, 60, 76). brothers (1, 2, 11, 74), brothers-in-law (9, 22, 37),\nuncles and nephews (25, 30, 52, 64), or cousins (22, 38, 39). The\nmaterial assembled there also permits us to gain an insight into how\ninternal relationships developed. A father intent on grooming his\nson for independence gave him as early as possible some capital for\ndoing business of his own, at the beginning preferably in partner-\nship with the son of a relative or business friend overseas.*” The\ngeneral trend was toward keeping separate accounts. Between\nfathers and sons the separation appears to have evolved only\ngradually, if at all. I do not remember ever having seen in the\nGeniza an account made between a father and a son. The countless\nreferences to cooperation between brothers, uncles and nephevws,\nand cousins, however, indicate that, as a rule, they took care of one\nanother’s affairs, but made exact accounts to the last penny.

When three brothers and their two cousins are congratu-\nlated on their safe return from a successful business trip, a high\nmeasure of coordinated activity among them must be assumed.*\n\nHaving cooperated in business during a lifetime, brothers and\nother relatives were inclined to appoint the surviving partner\ntrustee of their children and possessions.

Soc., I, 180—~181. In a notary’s draft a dying man asks his\nbrother to let his daughter stay with him and to take care of her\npossessions.*' How such wills were carried out is exemplified in a\ncourt record in which a merchant who was entrusted by his dead\nbrother and former partner with his affairs and the guardianship\nof his four children makes this deposition: The two brothers had\nput a sum of 230 dinars, of which one third had belonged to him\nand the other two thirds to his dead brother, into a business\nventure with a third partner. The latter was unsuccessful and, on\nhis deathbed, declared that he was unable to return more than 100\ndinars. In view of this great loss the guardian declared that he\nwould not take the sum due him, but share with his wards whatever\nwould be retrieved in equal parts.*\n\nMembers of the extended family were entrusted with guardian-\nships, because they had the moral obligation to assist relatives in\nneed. The sarcastic Alexandrian, whose letter is summarized at the\nbeginning of this subsection, harbored in his house five relatives\nbesides his immed iate family and, despite his prolonged illness, was\nprepared to accept two more.”® Even a poor scholar had to main-\ntain two sisters and a mother (a need that procured public office\nfor him).** “Had it not been for the mercy of Heaven and for my\nbrother’s son Joseph, I would have been forced to take recourse to\nIsrael [i.e., public charity].

Soc., 1, 182—183.\n\nThings being so, it was natural that everyone tried to protect\nloved ones against any possible claims that might be made against\nthem after one’s death. Hence the endless releases found in the\nGeniza safeguarding the rights of heirs, and, where the circum-\nstances recommended it, also for the lifetime of a contracting\nparty. One of the most extensive, most carefully styled, and beauti-\nfully written Hebrew documents in the Geniza is a bill of release\ngiven by Turayk (“Little Turk,” a woman) to the representative of\nthe merchants Muhsin b. Husayn, his three sons, and to his three\ndaughters, Sarwa (“Cypress”), Fa'iza (“Favorite”), and Nabila\n(“The Noble One”), and, finally, to his wife Fahda (“Cheetah”).\nSince Turayk had lived in Muhsin’s house for more than ten years,\nher heirs could argue that she might have given something to the\nyounger or female members of the household (who meanwhile had\ncome of age), so the release was drawn up as a precaution to\nforestall any claims.® In a complicated release given by a merchant\nto his partner, at the latter’s request, his brother, although he had\nno stake in that partnership, also granted a release in general\nterms, testifying that the family had not retained for itself any\nrights except those specified in the legal instrument.

His\nonly child, a minor daughter, was declared sole heir.®® His wife\nwas to be the orphan’s guardian, would remain in the house as long\nas she lived, be maintained from the estate, and conduct its affairs\nwithout anyone entitled to interfere. This shows that the testator\nhad full confidence in her. But if the girl died, the court would take\nover the property and maintain the widow out of it, or, if she\npreferred to marry again, pay her the delayed installment of the\nmarital gift stipulated in her marriage contract. “The balance of\nthe estate returns to my father’s house.” The phrase “returns”\nimplies that a man’s possessions consist in the first place in what he\nhas inherited from his forefathers and agnates and only partly in\nwhat he has earned himself.5!\n\nDespite the strength of the extended family it is natural that its\nvarious members did not always live with one another in peace.\nSuch things happened in both highly educated and low class\nfamilies.

That Jewish law made marriage obliga-\ntory—and, therefore, abstaining from it, a sin—only for men, did\nnot change the fact that women, especially of childbearing age,\nwere not tolerated by their environment to remain unmarried. At\nbirth a girl was wished “to come into a blessed and auspicious\nhouse”—there was no other wish for her. An ancient stipulation of\nthe ketubba, or marriage contract, is the undertaking of the hus-\nband, obligatory also for his heirs, that the daughters of his wife\nwill live in his house, even after his death, “until they are married.”\nNo other prospect in life is foreseen for them. In practice,\nhowever, things did not always work out that way, as is shown at the\nend of this section.’\n\nMarriage being thus taken for granted (unlike today in the\nUnited States with its fifty million singles and endless disquisitions\non the subject), one would hardly expect to find in the Geniza\nmuch material about “the philosophy” of the institution. Never-\ntheless, the attitudes toward marriage, as well as its realities, were\nby no means simple. In addition to what follows immediately, some\nof our probings will be included in the section on the social position\nand spiritual world of women (D, below).\n\nLegal documents, such as engagement agreements and marriage\ncontracts, would hardly make good guides for us in our quest. Why\ncertain legal forms were created, perpetuated, or allowed to fall\ninto desuetude depended on very specific circumstances. Their\nexistence or absence does not necessarily express the spirit of the\ntimes and the thoughts and sentiments accompanying the acts\nsealed by them. Yet, the legal instruments used by a society cannot\nbe entirely disregarded.\n\nThere can be little doubt that as far as marriage between young\npeople was concerned procreation was regarded not only as a\nreligious duty but also as the natural thing to be expected. But only\nin very few marriage contracts of the Palestinian rite of the tenth\nand eleventh centuries is a stipulation preserved in which the wife\ndeclares her readiness “to become a mother of children,” and, as\nof the twelfth century, this phrase seems to have disappeared\n\nGoitein, S.

I assume, once it was established that\nthe biblical injunction to multiply referred only to men, some\nscholars felt that the female partner was not obliged to participate\nin the process unless she had promised to do so in advance of her\nown free will. No change of attitude toward procreation, so marked\nin our own time, should be assumed here.\n\nMorecover, the biblical quotation “they built and succeeded”\n(2 Chronicles 14:6), often formulated as “may they build and\nsucceed,” found throughout the centuries as a superscription over\nmarriage contracts—Rabbanite and Karaite, Palestine minority and\nBabylonian majority rites—means nothing but “be blessed with\nchildren.” For the Semitic root dn contains the ideas of both\nbuilding and having children and is applied in this double sense in\nthe biblical good wishes on the occasion of Ruth’s marriage to\nBoaz.’\n\nThe Karaites, then a numerous and influential section of the\nJewish population, were particularly explicit as to the content and\nscope of companionship. 1 translate the relevant section from a\nKaraite marriage contract written in Jerusalem on January 26,\n1028.

The verbal noun translated by me as “consideration”*\nbut usually rendered with “compassion, pity,” appears regularly in\nKaraite documents in this connection, probably meaning that the\nwife should have patience with her husband, even if his conduct\nwas not quite exemplary. This brings us to the last point, namely,\nthat the wife should listen to her husband’s voice and “be under his\nrule” (again a biblical phrase), whereas the husband vows to make\nno improper use of his authority, “not to grieve'® and not to\noppress her.”\n\nIn the Jerusalem contract of 1028 the groom promised (in\naddition to the 50 silver pieces due a virgin according to Karaite\nlaw) a marriage gift of 40 dinars, or gold pieces, of which he\ndelivered 5 immediately, while she brought in a trousseau,\ndescribed in meticulous detail and estimated as having a total value\nof 61-1/2 dinars. According to living standards in Jerusalem at that\ntime the couple belonged to the lower middle class.\n\nComparing this with a Muslim marriage contract of the very\nsame year, 1028, concluded in an Egyptian provincial town by a\ngrain decaler and the virgin daughter of a miller, but listing a\nnuptial gift of only 1 + 1 = 2 dinars, we find companionship\nexpressed as follows:\n\n“He must fear God in respect of her and render her good companion-\nship, and, as God has ordained, do her no harm. . . .”** Since this contract\nis incomplete, I provide the continuation from a similar contract from the\nsame environment: “He must render her good companionship and she\nhas the same obligation toward him, but he is a rank higher.””* The\nconcluding phrase is taken from the Koran, 2:228, and, as the correspond-\ning quotation from the Bible in the Karaite document, establishes the\nsupremacy of the husband as a decree of God.

Love is a gift of God, not something one can\npromise to do.\"’\n\nShould we assume here a fundamental contrast between Jews\nand Muslims in the attitudes toward the institution of marriage?\nHardly. The difference was linguistic. The Karaite ketubba was\nformulated in Hebrew, always a living medium of literary expres-\nsion for matters connected with religion. The Rabbanite clerks\nwere instructed to use Aramaic, a dead language, in documents\nwith grave implications for family life, such as marriage contracts,\nbills of divorce, and deeds of manumission. This was done in order\nto safeguard the exact rendering of the ancient formulas establish-\ned at a time when Aramaic was the language of the courts all over\nthe ancient Near East. Thus we can only say that the Rabbanite\nmarriage certificates do not help us much in our search for the\nunderstanding of the medieval concept of companionship in\nmarriage. But the Karaite form—paralleled, as we assumed, by\nMuslim contracts emanating from corresponding social milieus—is\nof an importance transcending the narrow limits of a minority sect.\nThe Karaite dispensation consolidated during the ninth century,\nthat is, at the time of the blossoming of the new Middle Eastern\nbourgeoisie. The elaborate description of the marital relationship,\ntranslated above, was to the taste of a more refined and sophisti-\ncated society, and there was certainly no difference in this respect\nbetween the two branches of the jewish community, except per-\nhaps that the Karaites, at least those known to us from the Geniza,\nmostly were richer than the majority of Jews. The warm words of\nSaadya Gaon (d. 942) on marital love, including the sexual aspect,\nare indicative.\"® The insistence of the rabbinical courts on the use\nof fossilized formulas had its source in the apprehension that new\nformulations of documents on family life could lead to unforeseen\ncomplications.\n\nThe Karaite certificate from Jerusalem, 1028, is superscribed:\n“In the name of the living God.” Similarly, Palestinian Rabbanite\nmarriage contracts bear superscriptions such as: “In the name of\nour Creator,” an allusion to the benediction at the wedding meal\nwhich praises God as the “Former” of Adam and Eve.' But the\noverwhelming majority of marriage contracts does not bear such a\nsuperscription nor any reference to God—so profuse in the\ncorresponding Muslim documents.

As\nour second quotation at the opening of this subsection shows, it\nwas, above all, destined to protect man from sin, a need particular-\nly urgent in an urban environment. “Living in Cairo without a wife\nis extremely difficult for blameless and chaste persons,” empha-\nsizes a Karaite husband again and again while imploring a relative\nto induce his wife to return to him*' The wife is a2 wall around her\nhusband, she brings atonement for his sins and peace to his\ndomicile—and these are only three out of twelve, mostly spiritual,\ngoods that marriage has in store for men, as we read in a Geniza\nsermon.”? The nucleus of this sermon is found in the Talmud\nwhich goes as far as to say: “When a man marrics, all his sins are\nforgiven to him.”** This is not a joke, for the two other changes in\npersonal circumstances which are credited with such a consequence\nare the attainment of high office and conversion to the Jewish faith.\nThis shows that marriage is conceived as entrance into a state of\nhigher rank and greater responsibility.\n\nThe more elaborate Muslim marriage contracts emphasize the\nidea of the avoidance of sin in detail. Here is the introductory\npassage of a contract written in the Egyptian flax center al-Bahnasa\nin the year 1207 for a merchant who promises a nuptial gift of\n35 dinars to the daughter of a clothier.

The benedic-\ntion praises God for what he has permitted and prohibited in\nmarriage and concludes: “Blessed be He who sanctifies Israel\nthrough the bridal canopy and the conclusion of marriage.”\nSanctifying means keeping away from sin. An ancient epithalam-\nium from the Geniza describes this aspect of the marriage quite\n\nbluntly:\n\nMarried man, by enjoying your graceful doe,\nYou will stay immune from the sin of embracing a stranger.\n\nBoth the benediction and the poem are based on the Talmudic\nconcept of the wives’ role: “It is enough for us that they bring our\nchildren up and save us from sin.”® .\n\nAs stated before, procreation was a great religious duty, the first\none expressly mentioned in the Bible (Genesis 1:28). Perhaps it was\ntaken that seriously by the Jews because the very existence of the\ncommunity was so often in jeopardy. But there was more to it. The\naim, as is so often stated, was not merely to have children, but to be\nblessed with “sons studying the Torah and fulfilling its command-\nments;” in other words, it was not only physical, but in particular,\nspiritual perpetuation which was sought in the institution of\nmarriage.*’\n\nFinally—from bed to board—*\"a man’s table atones for him like\nthe altar in the Temple,”® a man attains bliss in life only through\nhis wife—as the Geniza sermon referred to above assures us.\nWithout a proper home no Jewish religious life was feasible. The\nbenedictions and elaborate grace accompanying the meals on\nworking days, Saturdays, and holidays, and many other religious\nduties, such as hospitality and care for the wayfarer and the poor,\nwere best fulfilled in the atmosphere provided by a household.\n\nYet the conclusion of a marriage was a predominantly secular\naffair. As explained in Med. Soc., 11, 163—164, the ceremony was\nnever held in a synagogue (or a mosque, or a church) and the\npresence of a religious functionary was not required.

But the “seven benedictions”\npronounced at the ceremony and repeated at the subsequent\nbanquet, or, rather, banquets, the superscriptions over the Pales-\ntinian Rabbanite and the Karaite marriage certificates, as well as\nthe proems to the Muslim marriage contracts translated above,\nprove that the religious aspect of marriage never was completely\nabsent from the minds of the medieval people on the southern\nshores of the Mediterranean.*\n\n1t should be noted that in the Eastern churches, as well as in the\nCatholic church, the blessings of the Church, or even the presence\nof a priest, although customary, were not required for a marriage to\nmake it legitimate, until the Council of Trent (sixteenth century)\ndeclared it to be obligatory.*\n\nChoosing a mate.—1 doubt whether we shall ever be able to\nunravel the tangled threads of family politics which were set into\nmotion by the birth and growing up of a boy or a girl and\ncontinued to be at work until the marriage of both. The women\nhad much say in these matters, but their voice seldom reaches us\nthrough the Geniza papers. Conscious of this deficiency, I shall\nnow try to summarize what we are able to glean on this subject\nfrom the documents available to us.\n\nSince endogamy, especially marriage with a cousin, was an\naccepted practice, the choice of a mate was largely predetermined.\nIf a more or less suitable close relative was available and amenable,\nthe matter was decided (see subsections A, 2, above, and B, 2,\nbelow). In any case, the relative had precedence. A postscript to a\nlovely family letter addressed to Qalyab, a little town north of\nCairo, contains this note: “We have saved the girl for Abu ’I-‘Ala. If\nhe is coming, have him send a message and inform us. If not, don’t\nlet him detain the girl. And Peace.” Then there is a second post-\nscript: “She is not a poor girl; she is well off.” The boy and girl con-\ncerned belonged, of course, to the extended family of the writer\nand recipient, and were not close relatives of either.* How deeply\nthese sentiments about the prior rights of the cousin were rooted is\nillustrated by the story of the India trader Abraham Ben Yija. As\nsoon as he arrived in Aden back from India after many years of\nsojourn there he offered the hand of his only daughter (together\nwith his riches) to any son of his brother or sister who, during his\nabsence, had been forced to leave their native Tunisia in the wake\nof the Norman invasion. His moving letter is translated in my\nLetters of Medieval Jewish Traders (pp. 201—206). When no reply was\nreceived, Ben Yiju settled in Aden, promised his daughter to a boy\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Immediately he went back on his promise to the\nAdenese family; but everyone understood that “the son of my\nbrother has more rights to her than strangers.” Having arrived in\nthe capital of Egypt, communications with his family (who then\nlived as refugees in Sicily) again became severed, and again there\nwere many who asked for the hand of the daughter of the India\ntrader. But Ben Yiji remained adamant.

A grand-\ndaughter of Sahlawayh also must have married out, as proved by\nthe very high nuptial gift assigned to her by her future husband.”®\nA good example of marriage policy is offered by the scholarly and\npublic-minded Berechiah brothers of Qayrawin (first quarter of\neleventh century).

Soc., 1, 49.\n\nFamily politics in the selection of mates were even more pro-\nnounced in cases where girls were exported from one country to\nanother. Tyre, Lebanon, then the busiest harbor on the Syro-\nPalestinian coast, was engaged in a lively exchange of goods with\nthe capital of Egypt. No wonder, then, that business houses in the\ntwo cities were eager to strengthen their positions by establishing\nfamily relations. The Geniza has preserved a large document from\nthe year 1051 in which a Karaite girl from Fustat became be-\ntrothed to a Rabbanite man from Qargisiya on the Euphrates living\nin Tyre, the go-between being none other than a grandson of\nManasse, the administrator of Syria, mentioned above.

If her father was unable\nor unwilling to make the journey, he was entitled to appoint a\nsubstitute who had the right to appoint another substitute for\nhimself; but the young man selected by any of the three repre-\nsentatives envisaged would be her legal husband.

There are indications that\nthe two families in those distant countries had already been\nconnected by an earlier link.*\n\nWhen, by the twelfth century, Egypt had been superseded in the\nMediterranean by the Italian navies, it turned eastward, to the India\ntrade which became its most lucrative overseas undertaking. In\nthose days we find that Madmiin, represen:ative of the merchantsin\nAden and superintendent of its harbor, as well as head of the Jews of\nYemen, was married to a sister of Aba Zikri Judah b. Joseph\nha-Kohen of Fustat, scion of a family of Palestinian Gaons and\nprominent India trader. Judah himself was married to a sister of\nMahruaz, a shipowner in Aden, who was in turn, it seems, closely\nrelated to Madmuan.*\n\nYet, such overseas connections were not always sought merely\nfor worldly gain. By chance, a letter of congratulation on Judah\nha-Kohen’s wedding has been preserved. From its wording it is\nevident that the marriage was regarded as the joining of two\nscholarly families, “mixing,” as the Talmudic phrase goes, “grapes\nof vine with grapes of vine.” Madmiin was not only the secular, but\nalso the spiritual head of the Yemenite Jews, and the other\nmembers of his family known to us were well read and public\nminded.*\n\nThis brings us to the genetic aspect of Geniza marriage, the\nendeavor to marry a girl from a scholarly family in the expectation\nthat she would produce the desired result, “sons studying the\nTorah.” In a long letter of congratulation on the occasion of the\nmarriage of the son of one scholar with the daughter of another\nscholar, whose son also was noted for his learning, the father of the\ngroom is first praised for “the mixing of grapes of vine with grapes\nof vine” (see above), secondly, he is assured that the young couple’s\noffspring will live up to expectations, since “boys become like their\nmother’s brother,” and, thirdly, the union would be blessed\nbecause the girl was an orphan (from her mother), and marrying\nan orphan was an act of great religious merit.*” In an extensive\nholograph to a dayyan, or judge, and his learned sons in a provin-\ncial town the Nagid Abraham Maimonides strongly recommends a\nyoung man, probably one of his former students, as a prospective\nson-in-law.

Yet, the Nagid emphasizes, “he still\npersists in his love” (of course, not to the girl, whom perhaps he\nhad not even seen, but to the scholarly family) and was prepared, if\nrequired, to commit all his possessions for the nuptial gift—as\nrecommended in the Talmud (“Sell all you have and marry the\ndaughter of a scholar”).*\n\nTwo letters of suitors to their future fathers-in-law, each\nremarkable for some special traits, are in the same vein. In one, a\nscholarly person expresses in the most glowing terms his satis-\nfaction at becoming connected with such a personality as his\n“father,” the recipient (whom he clearly knew only by hearsay and\none visit) and ascribes his bliss to the merits of his own fore-\nfathers known to his future father-in-law. Then he emphasizes\n(using an inappropriate quotation) the genetic aspect of perpetu-\nating the Torah through proper marital links. Finally he writes: “I\nmet the cantor Sedaqa Ibn Nufay' [the matchmaker] and was\ninformed by him about the friendly deliberations going on between\nyou about the conclusion of the marriage. I understand that you\nprefer to present the younger daughter, and not the elder one,\nnamely Sitt al-ahl [“Mistress of the Family”], may God support her.\nBut. ...” Here, the manuscript breaks off. One might surmise that\nthe visitor had gotten a glimpse of the “Mistress of the Family,”\nperhaps also talked to her and had been under the impression that\nshe was the one destined for him and was not satisfied with the\nchange proposed.*\n\nIn a society whose standard ideal was the pursuit of religious\nknowledge, family connection with a scholar was also sought by a\nperson clearly lacking it. In a letter in which the sender describes\nhimself as “the biggest man in the community”—although,\nremembering Proverbs 27:2, “Let another praise you, and not your\nown mouth,” he hated to say so—he asks for the hand of the\nrecipient’s daughter, because he wished to follow the sages’ advice\nto marry a scholar’s daughter. In addition, that connection would\nstrengthen his position. His profession obviously was not a very\nesteemed one, for he suggests that if his future father-in-law\nshould wish him to do so he would open a clothing store, a\nclothier being the most common occupation of a respectable\nmerchant, Muslim, Christian, or Jew. Throughout the letter the\nrecipient was asked to treat the matter with utmost secrecy and to\nreply, if possible, with the dawn of next morning, for, if he was\nrefused and this should leak out, the suitor would lose face.

No other such case has come to my knowledge.®* One\nmust keep in mind the fact, discussed below, that about 45 percent\nof all the women married entered that state a second time, that is,\nafter having been divorced or widowed. Realizing the astounding\nfrequency of that occurrence, one wonders what percentage of\ndivorcées and widows did not-marry a second time. One of my\nearliest and strongest impressions while doing research among\nMiddle Eastern communities was observing how women in the\nprime of their lives, previously married, were leading solitary\nexistences. Being then very young and not yet inured to the niceties\nof Oriental etiquette, I would ask in all innocence: “Why does a fine\nwoman like you not marry again?” The reaction was invariably,\nalbeit mostly in veiled form (but sometimes with a shudder):\nHaving been disgusted by her previous experience she did not\ndesire to try again. Should we assume the same for the Geniza\nperiod? After reading this book to its end the reader can judge\nfor himself. Anyhow, it must be noted that both in letters and in\ndocuments, especially in the lists of beneficiaries, a great number of\nsingle women appear in the Geniza.\n\nTo illustrate the situation, I discuss here two lists of recipients of\nbread. Bread was distributed every Tuesday and Friday by the\nJewish community of Fustat. Each time, each person received two\nloaves. For the clumsy word armala, “widow,” invariably mara,\n“wife,” was used, for example marat al-shaykh al-mayyit, “the wife of\nthe dead elder.” The first list, of which only the lower part is\npreserved, comprises 136 households, 48 of which were headed by\nwomen, and about 80 by men; a few cannot be identified with cer-\ntainty or contain items such as “the orphans of so-and-so.” By the\nsignatures attached to it and through other indications the list can\nbe assigned to the 1020s (see Med. Soc., 11, 128, 438439, and 469).\nIn the following I translate only the items referring to households\nheaded by women, although single women lived also in households\nheaded by men.\n\nThe woman from Byzantium,” 6 (loaves of bread).

Although the names of all persons\nconcerned are given in full, they are referred to at the beginning as\n“Reuben” and “Leah,” which means nothing but “So-and-so™; this\nwas customary in questions submitted to a jurisconsult; and,\nalthough the contract fixed the date of the wedding for a year after\nthe engagement, the legal question speaks of “a fixed term” in\ngeneral. “The symbolic purchase,” an expression recurring in the\ndocument again and again, was an act required by Jewish law for\nmost legal transactions. It is explained in Med. Soc. 11, 329. “The\ncarly installment,” the gift given by the husband to his wife at the\nwedding, is discussed subsequently.\n\n[Question] Maimonides, Responsa, 1, no. 88, pp. 138—144\n\nMay our master enlighten us on this question:\n\nReuben was engaged to Leah. A document containing the relevant\nstipulations was written, a term was fixed for the wedding, and a fine of 10\ndinars was imposed on the side that would break the engagement.\n\nThen Reuben traveled to Tripoli of the West [today Libya], and tidings\nwere received that the ruler of that place pressed all the mariners of the\nboats into service and sent them to al-Mahdiyya on a military expedition.\nReuben did not come back, and the time fixed for the wedding passed,\nwhereupon the father of the fiancée engaged her to another man.\n\nThe father of Reuben appeared in court and sued the father of his\nfiancée. But the latter argued: “The time agreed upon between me and you\nfor the date of the wedding has passed, and I cannot detain my daughter,\nfor I am a poor man.” The father of the fiancé retorted: “My son is\nimpeded by force majeur: you are the side who broke the engagement,\nwherefore you must pay him the ten dinars agreed upon for this\ncontingency.”\n\nThen the two parties deposited the early inistallment, which Reuben had\npaid to Leah, and the fine of 10 dinars obligatory on the side breaking the\nengagement, [with a third party], as well as the present which the father of\nthe fiancé allegedly had given as a gift to the fiancée according to the local\nusage, namely certain victuals. All this was deposited by them until they\nwould receive the answer of your excellency-—may God give you excel-\nlence—explaining what the law prescribes.\n\nThe father of the fiancé vowed the fine of 10 dinars to be paid to the\npoor, binding himself to pay it from his own money and capital in case his\nson, after his return, did not honor his vow.

All presents given to her still extant, such as\nclothing, must be returned. Of victuals she has to pay two thirds of the\nvalue to the fiancé or his representative.\n\nThe father has no right to sue for the “early installment” given by his\nson nor to take delivery of it, except through a proper power of attorney\nvalidated in court. The poor have no claim in this matter.\n\nWritten by Moses.\n\nThis document beautifully illustrates the discrepancy between law\nand life. A Jewish father had the right to give his minor daughter\ninto marriage (although such an action was disapproved by some\nauthorities), but once she had attained sexual maturity (which was\nput at the age of twelve years and six months), she was a legally in-\ndependent person. Therefore, Maimonides, in his answer, carefully\nstates: “The girl may marry whomsoever she likes.” But the father,\nin court, simply states: “I engaged her to another man,” without any\nreference to the girl's wishes, but giving his own financial situation\nas the sole reason for the new engagement. (He meant to say that as\n“a poor man” he could not take the risk to let an opportunity for an\nadvantageous family connection pass by. His claim of indigence\nmust be taken with a grain of salt. As proved by other such\ndocuments, the marriage gift of 40 + 100 = 140 dinars indicates\nthat the contracting parties definitely belonged to the middle class.)\n\nThe appointment by the girl of a representative was not man-\ndatory. Had she been a fully grown up, formerly married woman,\nshe could have negotiated the contract with her future husband in\nperson. In this respect, as we shall see, Jewish law substantially\ndiffered from that of Islam. But since she certainly was a mere\nteenager, both decency and practical reasons made the appoint-\nment of an experienced man as mediator imperative. Unlike many\nother cases, where the father does the job, here a brother of the\nmother was chosen for it. Presumably the mother had a great say in\nthe matter, because a substantial (or the main) part of the girl’s\nfuture dowry would come from the mother’s personal property or\nher bridal outfit. But in his appearance before court the father\nmakes no reference to the legal representative of his daughter.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "viii, B, 2 Engagement and Betrothal 69\n\nSimilarly, a father, as Maimonides emphasizes in his answer, had\nno rights whatsoever to the property of his adult son. But as this\nand many other documents show, a father, a brother, or another\nmember of the extended family would take care of the legal affairs\nof an absent relative, even without any formal power of attorney\ngiven to him, see section A, 3, above.\n\nThe “well-known” marriage conditions listed in the engagement\ncontract are self-explanatory and are discussed in detail below. The\nlast one, which seemingly gives the wife the exclusive right to\nchoose the domicile of the couple, may puzzle the reader, and a\nword of explanation is offered now. Marriage was patrilocal, the\nwife normally moved to the house of the husband’s family. When\nthe young wife did not get along well with her mother- and\nsisters-in-law, the common living quarters could cause her great\nsuffering, as is copiously illustrated in the Geniza. This clause was\ninserted in middle class marriage contracts to protect her.\n\nThe vow to the poor is a side issue. Since Maimonides had ruled\nthat the girl’s family did not owe a thing, the vow made under the\nassumption it did, had become void.\n\nThe three stages.—In principle, a marriage was achieved in three\nstages:\n\n1. Engagement, a contract in which the two parties agreed in the\npresence of at least two witnesses on the mutual financial and other\nobligations and rights, fixed a date for the wedding, and stipulated\nfines in the event that the agreement or the date of the wedding\nwas not honored. This was called shidditkhin (see n. 68, below) in\nHebrew, and mildk or imlak (“property conveyance”) in Arabic. This\nlegal act naturally was preceded by cautious testing of the ground,\nindirect and informal negotiations, and asking for the hand of the\nchosen mate.’\n\n2. Betrothal, or legal conclusion and religious consecration of\nthe marriage, by which the partners became husband and wife,\nalthough no intimate relations were yet permitted. This relation-\nship could be terminated solely by an ordinary bill of divorce; “a\nvirgin, divorced after betrothal,” as a term describing the legal\nstatus of the bride, is repeatedly found in Geniza marriage con-\ntracts. Two Hebrew terms, often combined, were in use for this\nstage: erusin, “betrothal,” and giddishin, “consecration.” Since Mus-\nlim law does not know this stage, milak or imlak is used for it, too.\nFrom a case where both the betrothal and the marriage contract\nof a couple have been preserved it is evident that the former\ncould be as elaborate and solemn an affair as the latter.?\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "70 Marriage viii, B, 2\n\n3. Consummation by wedding, legally defined as “entering,”\nnamely, the bridal chamber, or, when said of the bride, the\nhusband’s house; or as “taking,” namely, the bride as wife; or as\n“the procession,” namely, from the house of the bride’s father to\nthat of her future husband. The Arabic and Hebrew terms for\nwedding celebrations designate the festivities connected with the\nconsummation of marriage and usually do not have legal con-\nnotations.® On this occasion the ketubba, or marriage contract, was\nwritten.\n\nIn practice, stages one and two were often combined.* The same\nwas done, and even more frequently, with stages two and three.\nThe latter custom became the standard practice in the centuries\nafter the “classical” Geniza period. Thus, as a rule, the wedding was\npreceded either by an engagement or a betrothal. Sometimes,\nthough, when no contractual action had been taken before the\nwedding, the three elements—agreement on financial obligations\nand other matters, formal consecration, and leading the bride\nhome—were merged into a single event.\n\nOccasionally circumstances necessitated keeping the three stages\nseparate. A document from Minyat Ghamr, a small town in Lower\nEgypt, beautifully written by a schoolmaster in September, 1315,\ntells of the virtuous woman, the pious and chaste widow Rashida\n(her father was still alive), who appeared before witnesses and\ndeclared that she was prepared to marry a certain widower and to\nbring up his boy during the next ten years. The man had already\ngiven her 10 dinars as her first installment, promised a late one of\n30, and agreed to certain other stipulations, such as the usual one\nof leaving her the choice of the domicile. Then the document,\nwithout noting that the widower ever appeared, states that the\narrangement had become binding by the “symbolic purchase”\nmade from both by the witnesses.\n\nThis is what happened here: Rashida was a local woman;\ntherefore, since everyone present knew her, she did the talking;\nthe widower had come from outside to make the match and\nperhaps was not known to the witnesses. But that was not all. Both\nparties appointed representatives: she, her brother Rashid (note\nthe namel!); he, a person named but not described, perhaps a\nbrother of his late wife, who was concerned in safeguarding the\nrights of his young nephew. Why the representatives? Many things\nhad still to be agreed upon: the dowry she would bring in, the cost\nof the wedding he would have to bear, and the betrothal gift, the\ngiddishin, usually consisting of a ring, or, more commonly, rings,\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "72 Marriage viii, B, 2\n\nA few legal phrases conclude the record, which was carefully\nwritten and signed by Immanuel b. Yehiel, a prominent judge (see\nMed. Soc., 11, 515).\n\n[ translated this short record here, because it spotlights the legal\nsituation. But it was exceptional that a virgin bride should negotiate\nand contract a marriage with her future husband in person. This\nwas ap propria[c for an experienced woman, a widow, or a divorcée.\nGirls normally married at a tender age, when they knew very little\nabout either men or money. In general, we must imagine, the\nchoice was made by the tamily, the father normally having the last\nword, although the mother, as is natural and as we have seen,'* was\nalso very influential. In the absence of the father, it was usually the\nmother who arranged the marriage of her child.’* When both\nparents were dead, an aunt or even a grandmother could act.’\nThese details are important since they prove that the presence of a\nmale person was by no means required for giving a virgin girl away.\n\nTo what extent was the girl’s consent required? There is no\ndoubt about the legal situation. A girl who had reached maturity\ncould not be married without her consent, given before two\nwitnesses. Most complete and better-preserved engagement and\nbetrothal agreements and often also the marriage contracts indeed\ncontain the statement that the bride had appointed so-and-so as\nher respresentative to negotiate and conclude her marriage. At\nthat stage the choice of the mate had already been made, and the\nquestion is how far the future bride took part in his selection.\nFrankly, we do not know much about this point, since our sources\nhave little opportunity to make mention of it. From the frequency\nof engagements broken off and betrothals dissolved one may\nconclude that it was not only family politics and financial con-\nsiderations, but also the wishes of the young couples which\ninfluenced the final decision. Many marriage agreements say\nexpressly “if she [not her parents or another] breaks off the\nengagement.” No doubt much depended on the nature and\nstrength of all the personalities concerned.\n\nAccording to Qayrawanese legal practice, dislike of the groom by\nthe bride was a sufficient reason for granting her the right to\ndemand the dissolution of the betrothal. The Jewish courts in\nEgypt seem to have preferred to get a formal declaration from\nboth bride and groom that they did not like each other. This is\nevident from an official letter of Elijah b. Zachariah, judge in\nFustat, sent on order of the Nagid Abraham Maimonides to the\nJewish judge of Bilbays in Lower Egypt.

Judge Elijah, before\nwhom the case was brought, found out that the betrothal had\nindeed been formally dissolved, in the presence of the bride’s\nmother, before the late judge of Bilbays, one of whose associates\nwas his son and successor (to whom the letter is addressed). In\norder to be on the safe side, Elijah had the mother and the girl\nappear before him and had her declare that she disliked the\ncompany of her former betrothed and that she had no claims\nagainst him whatsoever. In the letter Elijah asked the judge of\nBilbays to now summon the repudiated groom and have him make\na similar declaration, namely, that he did not like the girl and was\nunable to maintain her.\"”\n\nSome Geniza letters seem to show that the future mates were not\nentirely inactive with regard to the choice of their hearts. The\nyoung man from Palermo who served as the business respresenta-\ntive of prominent Sicilian merchants in Egypt and married there an\norphan girl serving a great family instead of one of the daughters\nof the house—as the letter emphasizes—probably had his reasons\nfor preferring the orphan to riches, and perhaps it was she who\nhad taken the first step.’® In one of the most unrestrained letters to\nbe found in the Geniza a father imposes on a friend to see\nimmediately “the cursed matchmaker Mother of the Black,” and to\nask her to tell everyone that her story about his son was untrue; the\ngirl had lied, and possibly “the dear lady”—her mother—had lied\ntoo; his son did not wish at all to conclude that marriage. I suspect,\nhe wished, but the father did not find the match attractive for\nreasons of his own.'?\n\nEven where we have a detailed account of how a betrothal was\ninitiated, we cannot be sure about the true feelings and intentions\nof the parties. Naturally we experience a similar uncertainty in our\nown society. Anyhow, what people say (or do not say) is significant\nfor the mores of their times. The wealthy India trader Aba Ya'qub\nJoseph Lebdi took his widowed sister and her son Abraham b. Isaac\ninto his roomy house. Since the widow naturally passed most of her\ntime in the company of the other female members of the family,\nAbraham, when coming to see his mother, often had opportunity\nto meet his cousin Sitt al-Ahl (“Mistress of the Family”). But after\nboth his uncle and his mother had died, the situation became\ndifferent. At this point our story begins. It is contained in one long\ndocument in the hand of the court clerk Halfon b. Manasse, of\nwhich, thus far, eight fragments have been identified.

The two friends approached “the illustrious Rayyis\nAbu Sa‘d,” probably one of the India traders bearing that name at\nthat time, and he was cooperative. He understood, of course, and\nthe young man again explained that he intended to marry the girl\nbecause he wished to preserve his close contacts with his uncle’s\nfamily. (To say that he liked the girl would have been improper.\nBut did he?) The four men went to the widow’s house, and the\nV.I.P. Abi Sa‘d proposed. The widow answered that no one was\ndearer to her than her late husband’s sister’s son, but she would\nnever marry off her daughter in the absence of her son (who was\nan India trader like his late father and away on a voyage). Abi Sa'd\nreplied that after he had gone so far as to propose, he could not\nleave the house without having accomplished something; he sug-\ngested he would arrange the betrothal and leave the wedding until\nafter the return of the son. At this impasse the mother intimated\nthat Abu Sa‘d and his friends should talk to the girl, which they\ndid, emphasizing how well they knew and esteemed her. (Nothing,\nof course, was said about the prospective husband, or, at least there\nis no mention of it in the document.) Sitt al-Ahl agreed. Abraham\ndelivered 5 dinars and two rings, one of gold and one of silver, w0\nAbu Sa‘d; the latter handed them over to the girl, who sub-\nsequently declared: I have betrothed myself to him.

A group of Karaites from\nCairo had come to Jerusalem and stayed there for several months\npraying at the various holy sites. The group included a girl,\nRebekah, and two suitors of hers, Abraham and Simon. The elders\nof the company decided for the former (no reasons given), but\nRebekah preferred Simon. Abraham swore he would kill one of the\ntwo, if she was not given to him. The elders worried and asked the\ngirl to stay at home or to leave the house only when accompanied\nby a married woman. Meanwhile they asked the father in Cairo\nwhat to do, and he replied that his daughter should be married to\nwhom she wished.

At that\njuncture, Simon lost patience, and applied to a low official of the\nRabbanite community, who, in return for a small payment, con-\ncocted a marriage contract showing Rebekah as legally betrothed to\nSimon and containing fake signatures of all the Karaite elders. The\nfraud was easily detected, and a big scandal ensued. The official\nlost his position and was temporarily put under ban, but Rebekah,\ntoo, became very angry and declared now she would not marry\neither of her two former suitors. The story is included in a letter\nfrom Jerusalem addressed to the head of the Cairene Karaite\ncommunity, Aaron Ibn Saghir.®\n\nAn extreme example of a girl prepared to commit actions of\ndespair if she was married to a man whom she disliked (and was\nrefused the one whom she preferred) is found in a letter sent from\nAscalon, Palestine, to the judge Abraham, the Son of the Scholar,\nat the “House of Exchange” in Fustat. The letter is written in\nArabic characters (probably to prevent the carrier from reading it)\nand the writer, Joseph b.

(He\nwas not a relative, for he writes: “My family is your family,” an\nexpression used in urgent requests directed to a person with whom\nthe writer is not related.)\n\nJoseph was expected in Ascalon, but for reasons partly stated in\nthe opening section of his letter, he was delayed. Five days before\nhe arrived the girl whom he intended to marry (and who was\nknown to the judge) was betrothed to another man.

The purpose of Joseph’s letter was to\nalert the judge to the impending arrival of the message from As-\ncalon and to request him to see the Nagid and to press for a decision\nfavorable to the writer. In order to bring home the seriousness of\nthe situation, Joseph tells now what he had heard about the girl\n“Nougat.” [This was not the name given to her at birth, but a\nby-name designating her sweetness or any other trait associated\nwith that sweetmeat.] “If he takes her on order of the authorities or\notherwise by coercion, she will push her husband into a well, or take\nher own life.”* ’\n\nChild marriage—A minor could not make legal actions such as\nconcluding a marriage or appointing a representative. Conse-\nquently a father could marry off his minor daughter even without her\nconsent since a minor could not make a legally valid declaration.\nIn Islamic law there was no doubt about this. In Jewish law it was a\nmoot point. In principle, the father’s right was upheld, but the\ngreatest authorities of Talmudic times stated bluntly: “A father is\nnot permitted to contract a marriage for his minor daughter; [he\nmust wait] until she has grown up and says, I wish to marry\nso-and-s0.”?* The medieval Jewish doctors of law did not recognize\nthis maxim as binding. Maimonides tuned it down thus: “Although\na father is permitted to contract a marriage for his minor daughter\nwith whomever he likes, it is improper to do so, for our sages have\ndisapproved of this.”**\n\nThe Geniza records reveal that child marriages, although quite\nexceptional, did occur. In a holograph, a religious authority rules\nin an answer to a query: “As to that one of whom you write that she\nhas not yet reached maturity, but that her father wishes to contract\na marriage for her, there are no legal grounds on which you may\nimpede him; but you must endorse the marriage. There is also\nnothing to be afraid of in this matter [from the state authorities,\nsince this was also Islamic law].” Clearly there was some opposition\nto this marriage in the community, and the local official desired to\nbe on safe ground.

Clearly, this\nmarriage was a means for providing a home for an orphan, who\nalso shared a property with her mother-in-law. The colorful story\nof this girl will occupy us later in detail.** Another child marriage of\nan orphan is reported in the letter of a mugaddam, or head of a local\ncommunity, to his superior:\n\nHere is a man appealing to the community,* who keeps telling me that\nhe has already been married for two years and that his wife does not\npermit him access.

Two fragmentary court\nrecords from Bilbays, Lower Egypt, dated 1218 and 1221, re-\nspectively, tell about an orphan girl nine years old who was\nengaged on condition that the marriage take place three years\nlater. The groom promised an immediate marriage gift of 10\ndinars, and a delayed one of 60, as well as the customary con-\ntributions to the wedding expenses, such as “an entire night [of\nentertainment for the guests] and the saffron [for dyeing the\nbride’s hair] and safflower [used as make-up and as an admixture\nto hennal].” When the future husband failed to live up to his\npromises, the grandmother of the orphan girl refused to pro-\nvide the dowry in full.

In an engagement\ncontract, superscribed with beautiful Bible quotations such as “I\nshall betroth you forever, in sincerity, truth, and loving-kindness”\n(Hosea 2:21) a Kohen contracts a settlement with an “esteemed,\nliberal, and munificent clder” “with regard to his minor daughter”—\nexpressed in both Arabic and Hebrew and clarified by the addi-\ntional note “who is, thus, under the jurisdiction of her father.” The\nfirst installment of the marriage gift was 51 dinars—a strange\nsum—and the late one, 60 dinars (which shows these people as\nmiddle class people), while the groom would also bear the cost of\nthe bridal ornamental costume and the henna feast.* The wedding\nwas to take place five years after the date of the document. The\ndefaulting party would have to pay the unusally heavy fine of 280\ndirhems of nugra silver, about 20 dinars. Without additional data\nwe cannot know why the two families bound themselves for so long\na period. Perhaps an aging father wished to make sure that his little\ndaughter would marry into a good family, while the young man\nwas sure that it would be a profitable match.* Similarly, when a\nrich, young woman, in a deathbed declaration, expressed the wish\nto have the daughter of her brother saved for marriage to her\ninfant son, her will, though not legally binding, but backed by a\nsubstantial estate, certainly was heeded, as far as circumstances\npermitted. An interesting, but unfortunately incomplete, docu-\nment foresees a waiting period of seven years “until she matures,”\nbut leaves it to the adolescent girl to decide whether or not to carry\nthe match through. A brother of hers was also involved in the\nagreement made between the two families, but exactly how is not\npreserved.®\n\nSometimes the paternal authority to marry a minor daughter\nhad bizarre or disastrous results. When a married elder sister of\nseven-vear-old Sitt al-Dar (“The Lady of the House”) died an\nutimely death, the child was promised to the widower. He agreed\nto pay 4 dinars in addition to the 16 dinars that he had already paid\nas nuptial gift when he married the elder sister, and to take the\nlittle girl home after three years. When he did not show up at the\nstipulated time, and another married sister of Sitt al-Dar died, she\nwas (o substitute for the second sister the very week she died (no\ndoubt because the woman had left a baby who had to be attended\nto and, as a single girl, Sitt al-Dar could not stay with her brother-in-\nlaw). But when the community assembled for a hurried wedding\nceremony, many remembered the former arrangement, and it took\nsome time before the legal situation was clarified.

A girl whose father was dead “engaged herself,” as the text\nsays, and a big party was given. After two months, “Simon,” a relative\nof hers who had attended the party, appeared in court and\npresented a document in which the father of the girl had betrothed\nher to him four years before, while she was still a minor. Neither the\nmother of the girl nor she herself knew anything about this, and,\nunderstandably, when Simon came to ask for her hand and also sent\ntwo go-betweens to explain that, as her relative, he had more rights\nto her, she indignantly refused. Finally she sent her maternal uncle\nto him and asked him to provide her with a bill of divorce, but he\nwould not hear of it. The court found itself in a dilemma: the\ndocument was legally valid; in addition, honoring the will of a dead\nperson was a sacred duty. In her distress the mother applied to the\nqadi, who asked the Jewish judge to assemble ten of the elders of the\ncommunity and thus to exercise pressure on Simon to issue the\nrequired bill of divorce. Simon gave in, but only to claim after some\ntime that the bill was written under duress and therefore void.\nMaimonides, however, ruled that pressure exercised by a court was\nproper, while Simon’s conduct constituted duress. The girl was free\n\nto marry whom she wished.*\n\nThis is about all I know about child-marriage in the classical\nGeniza period, and [ do not believe that much more will be found. It\nwas an insignificant social phenomenon, but I have treated it at some\nlength because it is indicative of the near absolute paternal au-\nthority, which was equally operative with regard to the mature virgin\nwho was legally independent. There must have been countless cases\nin which the teenage girl was shocked when her father communi-\ncated his choice to her. But I have searched the Geniza in vain for a\ncomplaint lodged by a daughter against her father with a Jewish\ncourt,a Muslim authority, or even only a relative. A father’s decision\nwas like a decree of God. [t was taken for granted that God was\nalmighty, “doing whatever he liked,” but also that he was full of\nmercy with all his creatures; in like vein a father’s authority and his\nlove for his children were accepted as matters of course; conse-\nquently, questioning the wisdom or righteousness of his decisions,\nhowever cruel and incomprehensible they might have appeared,\nwas impious, and, in any case, futile.

As in most legal documents, the signatories appear\nas “witnesses,” not in their official capacity. This absence of the\nindication of 2 communal authority was not accidental. It was not\nneeded. According to Jewish (and Muslim) law two witnesses were\nsufficient for the legal contraction of a marriage. This principle was\nupheld even by as late an authority as Abraham Maimonides, who,\nin reply to a question submitted to him, ruled that a couple who in\nevery respect behaved as non-Jews, demonstrating their apostasy by\npublicly desecrating the Sabbath, but who had contracted a mar-\nriage in the presence of two Jewish witnesses, were legally married.*\n\nSuch “freedom of contract” in family matters could have most\nundesirable consequences. When a girl from a provincial town,\nwhose father was dead, wished to marry in the capital, the Nagid,\nor head of the Jews, who probably had been tipped off by someone,\nsent an inquiry to the local judge asking him to find out whether\nthere existed any impediment to the proposed marriage. Here is\nthe answer of the judge: “I learned that this girl was engaged\nseveral times, but it is not clear to me whether a marriage was\ncontracted with anyone of those who proposed and became en-\ngaged to her. Her mother must be carefully examined as to what\nthe situation was at each engagement, and if any doubts remain,\nfurther inquiries will be necessary.” Had marriage registers existed\nin the town, or if registration of marriage had been obligatory, no\nsuch doubts would have existed.*’\n\nA case of two marriages contracted by one woman is explicitly\nreferred to in an incompletely preserved court record written by the\nexperienced clerk Halfon b. Manasse. Sitt al-Husn (“Lady Beauty”)\nconcluded the contracts after the death of her first husband, but\nperished “in the famous murder case,” together with her mother\nand the two men concerned. The documentitself deals only with the\nclaims of the heirs: the nephews of the mother, who asserted they\nwere the only heirs, and others, who derived their rights from the\ndaughter, how, is not preserved.

I assume the man with whom the first\nmarriage had been contracted had been away for years, but came\nback by chance just when a nahb, outburst of pillage and murder\nby marauding soldiers or bandits, swept a provincial town.*!\n\nUnder those circumstances it is natural that the authorities tried to\nsupervise the marriages, at least of foreigners, divorcées, or in\ngeneral, any couples whose personal status was not well known in the\ncommunity. A Fustat court record from the year 1085 or so states\nthat a man from Tiberias and another from al-Ladhigiyya on the\nSyrian coast testified that a woman from the latter town had been\ndivorced by her husband, who later married again and died. This\ntestimony was required by her for her second marriage.”” In the\ntimes of the energetic Nagid Samuel b. Hananya the procedure of\nmarriage permits was streamlined. It consisted of three parts: (a)\na declaration of two witnesses that there was nothing in the personal\nstatus of either the groom or the bride which might impair the valid-\nity of their marriage; (b) the validation of the testimony by the court;\n(¢) a communication to the Nagid by the court that a fine of 10 dinars\nwas imposed on the groom in case any impediment should become\nknown; to this, a request to grant the permit was attached. Three\nsuch documents from the years 1153, 1159, and one whose date has\nnot been preserved have been noted thus far from this period. All\nof them have as one of the two witnesses Judah, the son of Solomon\nthe scribe. Thus it is evident that the couples were known to the\ncommunal scribe, and the testimony was a mere formality.*\n\nUnder Samuel b. Hananya’s successors the text of the permit, or\nrather the testimonies leading up to it, were refined so as to specify\nthat there existed neither a religious nor a civil impediment to the\nproposed marriage. One civil impediment often mentioned in the\nGeniza, as we shall see, was the nonfulfillment of financial obliga-\ntions toward a divorcée.** A permitissued under the authority of the\nGaon Sar Shalom (ca. 1177—-1195) is noteworthy because it was\ngiven to a couple from higher Jewish society. In a letter to the same\nhead of the Jewish community of Egypt the mugaddam of Qalyab\ncertifies that, to the best of his knowledge, there was no civil or\nreligious impediment to the marriage of a girl called ‘Ama’im,\ndaughter of Abu ’l-Hasan. As the content of the letter shows, there\nwere reasons why the Gaon ordered an inquiry. The family had\nmoved from one place to another; the girl’s sister was married to a\nfreedman, and her brother had left Qalyab for the Manafiyya\ndistrict, where he embraced Islam.®\n\nOf particular interest is a testimony from the year 1217 pre-\nserved in two copies (one in Cambridge, England, one in New\n\nGoitein, S.

He now wished to find for her a husband.\nMarriages with freedwomen were commonplace, but since the girl\nprobably was an educated young woman, the physician wished to\navoid the term betraying her former low social status and chose\nthat obsolete formulation.*”\n\nAs the document analyzed in Med. Soc., 11, 344 proves, the head\nof the Jewish community confirmed not only the marriage permits\nbut also the special conditions attached to individual marriage\ncontracts. But all this was of no avail as long as persons could legally\nconclude marriages without applying to the authorities at all. In\norder to preclude these anarchic procedures, especially in provincial\ntowns and villages, anyone other than the judges appointed by the\ncentral authorities who presided over a marriage or a divorce was\nthreatened with excommunication. Such a declaration, issued by\nMoses Maimonides and his court in January 1187, with regard to\nthe judges of Damanhiir, Bilbays, and al-Mahalla in Lower Egypt,\nand another one, referring to that of 1187 pronounced in\nAlexandria in 1235, have been preserved.*\n\nThe law, which regarded a marriage contracted in the presence\nof two lay witnesses as legal, remained in force, however, and\nMaimonides himself recommended its use in a situation of hardship\nfor the parties concerned. A woman whose two husbands had died\nwas offered a third marriage at the time of the great famine of\n1201-1202. The local judge refused to marry them because of the\nancient superstition that she was a “killer” and might cause the\ndeath of her third husband. Maimonides ruled: “They should\ncontract the marriage in the presence of two witnesses, which is\nperfectly legal. Later the document should be issued by the court,\nthe judge feigning ignorance of what has happened. Being strict\nwith regard to this little offense could lead to far graver compli-\ncations.”*\n\nBy “graver complications” Maimonides meant an application\nto the state authorities. Such things indeed happened, and in\nMaimonides’ own time. A Kohen, or member of the priestly family\nof Aaron, is not permitted to marry a divorcée. This is the law of\nthe Torah, and nothing can be done in this matter. A Kohen in\nAlexandria “loved” a divorced woman and had the unheard-of\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Maimonides excommunicated him in\nan unusually extensive and strongly worded document. From the\nwording of this ban I conclude that such occurrences were ex-\nceptional, at least, in the period concerned.*\n\nBasically, an application to the gadi by non-Muslims was equiv-\nalent to what we would call civil marriage. In a document issued by\na Muslim court in Aswan, Egypt, in 948, a Coptic deacon married\nthe daughter of a priest, assigning her the then high dowry of 90\ndinars. Seventy-seven Muslim witnesses signed the contract; the\nexceptionally numerous participation in the festivity manifested\nthe popularity enjoyed in the town by those members of the\nChristian clergy. Two other marriage contracts of persons with\nCoptic names also were issued by a Muslim authority.®’ In an\ninteresting Muslim document from 1025 a Jewish father-in-law\nreturns to the fiancé of his daughter the sum of 20 dinars,\nrepresenting the initial installment of a nuptial gift of 70 dinars, in\norder to use it on a business trip; in the course of two months the\nprospective son-in-law has to send back 21 dinars,”® and an\nadditional four months of absence are granted to him. Thus the\ncivil aspects of the marriage were arranged with the state author-\nities.®® From the same period, however, a far graver case for\nsubmitting Jewish family affairs to a Muslim judge is reported. In\nSahrajt in Lower Egypt a woman was charged with having\n“divorced her husband” with the help of the qadi, who also fixed an\nalimony for her, which the husband paid for three months. For\nthat offense against communal discipline and religious law the\nwoman was reprimanded and put under ban. But she went up to\nthe capital and declared before the central court that it was her\nhusband, not she, who had brought the matter before the qadi.\nFinally, it became evident that the two had agreed on this pro-\ncedure by mutual consent. There is also a mutilated note saying\nthat the man did not {or should not) have “affairs with women.”\nSeeing that members of the Christian clergy legalized their family\nmatters before a Muslim authority, we are not surprised to see Jews\nin a small town with no proper Jewish magistrates nearby doing the\nsame.*\n\nSuch incidents, however, were exceptional. Family law was the\ndomain of communal autonomy. The state authorities acted only\nwhen approached by the parties affected. The two stories told\nabove, of marriages contracted for minors and brought before\nqadis, are examples.® Yet it is noteworthy that many marriage con-\ntracts contain the stipulation that they are binding according to\n\nGoitein, S.

It happened on Monday, that is, a day on\nwhich court meetings were regularly held, November 11th, 1146.\nThe virgin bride was represented by her mother, but the fiancé\nconducted the negotiations in person, and no surety was required\nfrom his father, which means that Semah stood on his own feet\nfinancially.\n\nThe most urgent matter to be settled was the first installment of\nthe marriage gift to become the bride’s property on the day of the\nwedding. A sum of 40 dinars was deposited with a third party, also\nan attar, known to us from other documents. and 100 dinars were\npromised as the late installment.

Although a full year was still to intervene\nuntil the wedding, the fiancé took no chances. The value of each\nand every piece of the trousseau, about one hundred twenty-five of\nthem, was estimated, making a total of 640 dinars, and the list was\nattached to the engagement document.

At an engagement in\nAugust, 1132, the first installment amounting to 5 dinars out of a\ntotal marriage gift of 35 dinars was handed over, but no fine was\nstipulated in the event of a break. The absence of such a stipulation\nwas unusual but is to be explained by the fact that the wedding was\nto be held only about two weeks later and everything—including\nthe trousseau we might assume—was ready.®' In another en-\ngagement, concluded at the same time before the same judge,\nwhere the wedding was fixed for six months later, a fine of 2 dinars\nwas stipulated, the nuptial gift promised was 4 + 20 = 24 dinars, and\nonly one silver ring was handed over to the father. Probably these\nwere people in strained circumstances who had still to find all the\nmeans necessary for making good their promises.®* A girl whose\nfather and, probably, also her mother were dead (because she was\nrepresented by a paternal uncle of her mother), received two rings,\none of silver and one of gold, at her engagement, and a promise of\na marriage gift of 10 + 20 = 30 dinars.

In the course of time, the two parts of\nthe document had become separated, so that there is no way to\nknow to whom the trousseau list refers; and an engagement or\nbetrothal document that appears to us as strange may be explained\nby the supposition that another document had originally been at-\ntached to it or that it was written before or after the agreement\n\nGoitein, S.

I shall give them to her,\nor to a representative of hers, as soon as God has them ready for me.” We\nbetook ourselves to her, and, after her identity was established by two\ntrustworthy witnesses, she legally appointed So-and-so as her representa-\ntive. Having done this, we betrothed him to her in a definite marriage\nbond and gave the “gratifictions” to her representative. . . .\n\nSeventeen days passed between the first and last court actions\nin this matter. The document shows that the bride could have acted\nherself. Her representative did not have to be her father nor any\nother relative, and situations have been found where no family\nrelationship is evident to us. The rings may once have had a\nsymbolic significance, but by that time their sole purpose was to\ngratify the bride and to serve as the formal betrothal gift obligatory\nat the conclusion of a marriage. Clearly this document reflects\narrangements made for poor people.\n\nAn even older description of betrothal procedures, taken not\nfrom the Geniza, but from a question sent from Qayrawin to\nSaadya Gaon (d. 942 in Baghdad), emphasizes the role of the\nfather. It deals with a case of which we have already had two ex-\namples, namely, that a man had more than one daughter, and\nthere were doubts with whom the marriage was or was to be\nconcluded.\n\nThis is our local custom with regard to marriage. If she has come of age,\nshe empowers her father to receive her betrothal gift; if she is a minor, he\ndoes so on his own, as approved by the sages. The congregation assembles\nin the synagogue which the father attends and he receives there the\nbetrothal gift for his daughter. This Reuben [meaning the father of the\ndaughters] was a scholar and an old man, and scholars and others\ngathered in the house of study. [The old scholar prayed in a beth midrash,\nor house of study.] Simeon [the groom] stood up from his seat and gave\nthe betrothal gift to Reuben, while the scholars from the school of the late\nR. Nathan were seated around. Simeon spoke up and said: “May your\ndaughter be married to me by this ring.” Those present shouted to him in\nHebrew about four or five times: “Say, which: say, which,” but he paid no\nattention to them because he was abashed, standing before the congre-\ngation and the scholars.”™\n\nThe synagogue, it should be noted, is used here not as a place of\nworship but as one of public assembly and legal action. The parties\nconcerned seemingly were low class, showing little concern about\nthe prestige of the family and the welfare of its members.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "viii, B, 2 Engagement and Betrothal 89\n\nA betrothal document written in Fustat in summer 1007 ema-\nnated from a higher level of society. Its study enables us to under-\nstand why, at certain times, it was found desirable to keep the\n“betrothal,” that is, formal marriage, and the wedding separate.\nHere, again, the daughter had appointed her father as her\nrepresentative. The groom (in the absence of the bride) hands over\nto the father 100 dinars and the rings, after the groom and the\nbride had agreed to the usual mutual obligations they would have\nto fulfill once they were united under the bridal canopy. Another\n150 dinars are promised as late installment. An accompanying\ndocument no doubt contained details about the trousseau and the\nimpending wedding.™\n\nA purse of a hundred gold pieces was a very high sum of money\nin those days; its delivery demonstrated that the contracting parties\nwere in earnest. We see here the raison d’étre of the “betrothal™\nby making the marriage definite through its formal conclusion as\nwell as its financial arrangements, it left for the wedding solely its\nceremonial and social aspects: the benedictions, the other rites, and\nthe banquets. It was a reaction against the age-old experience that\n“there is no ketubba that does not elicit squabbles,” meaning last-\nminute misunderstandings about details of the dowry or the\nmarriage gift which used to arise when the marriage was formally\nconcluded and the contract signed at the wedding.™\n\nIn the preceding subsection, we saw how a well-to-do family ob-\ntained the same result by an engagement contract: the first install-\nment of the marriage gift was presented in cash, but it was de-\nposited with a third party, and the dowry was readied up to the last\ndetail. For the betrothal was a grave affair; it bound groom and\nbride together without granting them a common life. Only a\nformal divorce could make them free again. This could lead to\nmany complications, especially as the young men had to work hard\nin order to be able to marry and often had to travel overseas.\nImagine a young man who was betrothed to a girl in a provincial\ntown in North Africa, did business in Egypt, and decided to break\noff the betrothal (perhaps because he wished to marry a girl in the\nnew country). How much could happen until he would be willing\nand able to have the bill of divorce issued and until it reached its\ndestination. The Geniza tells us about such a case.™\n\nFurthermore, since “betrothal” meant formal marriage, groom\nand bride became legally responsible for each other. When an\norphan girl wished to dispose of a piece of property held in trust by\nthe court, her action had to be confirmed by the man to whom she\nwas betrothed (1082).

The reader is reminded of the story\nopening this subsection, where a father was in a hurry to engage his\ndaughter to another man while her fiancé tarried overseas longer\nthan anticipated.\n\nWe have comparatively few documents from Cairo, the newly\nfounded caliphal residence, for during the “classical” Geniza\nperiod its Jewish community was small, and the Geniza chamber\nwas in Fustat, situated about two-and-a-half miles south of the\nFatimid residence city; still, for the short span of the years\n1107—1110 we have at least three betrothal contracts from Cairo.\nIn spring 1107 a groom (whose father was dead) promised a first\ninstallment of the marridge gift worth 10 dinars, 5 of which were\ngiven to the girl at the betrothal, and a late one of 30 dinars. Thus,\nthese were lower middle class people. No ring is mentioned; 5\ndinars are, of course, an entirely sufficient betrothal gift, and their\npayment, as we shall see later, was regarded as a local custom. The\nwedding was fixed for two years later, and the young couple was to\nlive with the girl’s parents (in one house, not in one apartment); the\nparents obviously were old and had no one else to look after them\nbesides their daughter. Moreover, the groom promised never to\nchoose a domicile for his future wife outside Cairo. The document\nis in the handwriting of the eminent judge Abraham b. Nathan,\nMed. Soc., 11, 512, and signed by, among others, Abraham b. Shab-\nbetay, another learned judge (see ibid, p. 47). Thus, the betrothal\ncertainly was arranged in accordance with all requirements of the\nthen valid law.™\n\nIn October 1108, another groom whose father was dead was\nbetrothed to a girl in Cairo, this time with one ring of gold and\nthree of silver, promising a marriage gift of 5 + 20 = 25 dinars, but\nretaining for himself the right to move with her elsewhere when-\never he saw fit.

We notice that despite\nthe great similarities, each case was different.”\n\nA document from approximaely the same period (date not pre-\nserved) describes arrangements in a well-to-do family, for which we\nhad another example in the betrothal contract of 1007, above.\nHere, both fathers were dead; the groom bore the honorary title\n“elder”; the bride, “of her free will,” had appointed a brother of\nher mother as her representative, who received for her as “be-\ntrothal silver” 20 dinars, to be complemented, at the wedding, by\n50 dinars as first installment of her marriage gift; the defective state\nof the manuscript leaves unclear what the second was to be, but it\nmight have been 70 or 90 dinars or even more. In addition, she was\npromised a khil'a, or festive attire, normally consisting of a robe, a\ntiara, and a wimple, for the wedding. Several conditions, usually\nreserved for the marriage contract, are also included, such as that\nwhich makes a wife “trustworthy like two witnesses in her house\nand her word,” meaning that no oath could be imposed on her with\nregard to her management of the house. On the other hand,\ncertain parts of a compound, such as a house (or parts of it) and\nhalf a store, would be included in her dowry.™\n\nI wish to conclude this survey with a few specific items. A long\nletter from Jerusalem, sent around 1085, contains this line: “I\narranged a marriage for my younger son Abu Nasr. It was a beau-\ntiful betrothal.” The social event of the banquet seems to have been\nthe only detail worth mentioning. From a betrothal document from\nDecember, 1093, written in Fustat by the judge Abraham, son of\n[saac, the scholar (Med. Soc., 11, 512), we learn that a betrothal gift\nof 5 dinars was Egyptian local custom. This custom certainly had\nancient antecedents, since the sum is referred to later in the\ndocument as “the 4 1/6 dinars.” (A change must have occurred,\nperhaps when the money lost some of its value, and the 4 1/6\ndinars were upped to 3.) In addition, the groom promised a mar-\nriage gift of 10 + 40 dinars, so that this total commitment, as the\ndocument states, was 55 dinars. In a preceding court session the\nbride had authorized her father to conduct the negotiations, and\nnow the father agrees that the young couple would occupy the\nupper floor of a house acquired by him, as long as his daughter\nlived, while he and his heirs would pay the ground rent and the\n\nGoitein, S.

If she preferred to live else-\nwhere, she would receive the rent. We see here that the choice of\nthe domicile was the wife’s prerogative, even where no difficulty\nwith the husband’s family was anticipated. A fine of 10 dinars was\nimposed on the party that called off the betrothal.”\n\nOur second choice is a betrothal document written on a Satur-\nday night and stipulating that the wedding was to be held prior to\nthe forthcoming Sabbath. Again the nominal betrothal gift of 4 1/6\ndinars is mentioned, but in reality 10 dinars were delivered to the\nfather together with the betrothal ring. The remaining 10 dinars of\nthe first installment of the marriage gift (20 + 30 = 50) were to be\ngiven to the bride in the form of two bracelets. She would follow\nher future husband to al-Mahalla, the provincial town, where the\nwedding would be held that very week. No doubt a banquet was\ngiven also in Fustat, where the girl was betrothed. Although only a\nfew days separated the wedding from the betrothal, a fine of 10\ndinars was imposed on the side breaking the contract (Nov. 1131).%°\n\nThe same court record notes, a few weeks later (Jan. 1132), the\nbetrothal of a girl with the proud name Jami‘ (an abbreviation of\nSitt al-Jami, “Ruler over Everyone”), who was so poor that, at the\nbetrothal, she, or rather her father, got nothing but a ring, and for\nthe wedding she was promised only | dinar, plus 25 dirhems, the\nobligatory marriage gift for a virgin. But even that did not work; a\npostscript notes the delivery to her of the bill of repudiation (before\nthe consummation of the wedding).**\n\nA brighter outlook awaited the orphan “Beauty” (Sitt al-Husn).\nThe father of the groom undertook to maintain the couple for five\nyears and to be responsible even for the late installment of her\nmarriage gift (5 + 20 = 25 dinars; it might well become due after his\ndeath). No representative appeared on her side, which means that\nshe had come of age; but, since the wedding was fixed for about two\nyears later (betrothal: Sept. 1184; wedding: Aug./Sept. 1186), she\ncertainly was still very young, and the two judges who signed the\ndocument watched over the financial arrangements. The young\nman was probably a student who prepared himself for a profession\nthat would enable him to earn money only years later. Since the\nbetrothal was made on the day before the Feast of Tabernacles\n(Sukkot), the festive meal on the evening preceding that holiday, 1\nassume, served also as betrotital banquet {(see subsection B, 3,\nbelow).®\n\nWhen a betrothal was canceled, the parties could be in disagree-\n\nGoitein, S.

A man named Tarib (“Merry,” later in the docu-\nment referred to as “Abraham known as Aba Tarib”), represented\nhis sister, a girl whose father was dead. When the betrothal was\ncanceled, the groom demanded the return of 15 dinars given as the\nfirst installment of the marriage gift. A lawsuit ensued, and a board\nof arbitration, consisting of four prominent citizens (all known to\nus from other documents), decided that Tarib had to return 9\nof the 15 dinars paid and also to renounce all claims that he, his two\nbrothers, his mother, or his sister (in that order) might raise against\nthe groom or against his brother (Dec. 22, 1026, which was a Jewish\nday of fasting, 10 Teveth). In another case a family offended by the\nannulment of a betrothal by the bride’s side forced her new groom\nto give her up.®\n\nAll the betrothal documents considered thus far originated in\nEgypt, Palestine, or the Maghreb. Quite different from these and\nof a rather specific character are three betrothal documents written\nin Damascus in January and February 933 “according to the\ncustom of the small synagogue, namely that of the Babylonians.”*\nThe groom’s action is defined here as “he gave the ring of pledge\nfor [not: to] her,”® and the minimum marriage gift, referred to\neither with the biblical phrase “méhar for virgins,”® or simply as\n“in accordance with the custom of the small synagogue,”’ was 25\ngold pieces, to which the bridegroom regularly made an addi-\ntional promise. This colony of merchants from Iraq who had set-\ntled in Damascus obviously wished to maintain a certain standard\nof living among its members, and this usage might well have been\nbrought with them from their native country.”® The groom in the\nsecond document, Mansir b. Isaac b. Sa‘'id b. Phinehas (Finhas),\nprobably belonged to the famous Phinehas family of Baghdad,\nwhich seems also to be represented in Damascus by another mem-\nber as party to a contract for sale of a property written by a Muslim\nnotary around the same time (922).%\n\nThe details concerning the individual couples are also note-\nworthy. In the first contract from 933 the groom, who had\npromised a total marriage gift of 35 dinars, registered in the name\nof the bride one of four shares in a compound belonging to him,\nthat share representing the value of the gift.

The third match\nwas concluded between an orphan and a poor man, who promised\na marriage gift of 30 dinars, but was able to produce only 7 at the\nbetrothal and 3 at the wedding; thus his delayed installment\namounted to 20 dinars like that of Mansir. But the bride possessed\nan apartment consisting of several rooms, which she had inherited\nfrom her father, so the couple was at least assured of a domicile.\nThe fathers and the guardian of the orphan promised to be fully\nresponsible for the maintenance of the brides until their wedding.\nSince groom and bride had become legally married through\nbetrothal, and since marriage made the maintenance of the wife\nobligatory on the husband, such promises were by no means\nsuperfluous. Yet no such stipulation is found in the many other\nbetrothal documents studied above, although there can be no\ndoubt that, until her marriage, the betrothed was maintained by\nher family. The realities of life, we see, are not always reflected in\ndocuments; in many respects, common usage was strong enough to\nensure proper conduct.\n\nThese betrothal contracts from Damascus are registered, one\nbeneath the other, on a large sheet, once forming part of a record\nbook. Yet each is signed by a number of witnesses, the one of the\ngroom from the Phinehas family by ten, to whom the head of the\ncongregation added his own signature (signing last, as required by\nthe ceremonial then in force).”\n\nSimilarly, on a page of a record book from the Palestinian syna-\ngogue of Fustat, dated September 7, 1043, the copy of a ketubba is\nsigned by seven (here again, with the head of the congregation\nsigning last). This procedure, which is evident in other docu-\nments from the tenth and early eleventh centuries, emphasizes the\npublic character of the act of concluding a marriage. Later gene-\nrations obviously found it too burdensome for the witnesses to sign\nboth the original document, handed over to the bride, or her\nfamily, and the copy preserved in the communal records. The\nengagement, betrothal, and marriage contracts that had been\nregistered were then often signed either by two or more officials, or\nby one in addition to the clerk, whose handwriting was regarded as\nsufficient for making the entry a public record. No fixed system is\nto be cbserved in this matter, but it is perhaps reasonable to assume\nthat this later practice was influenced by the Muslim example,\nwhere “trustworthy witnesses” were permanently attached to the\nqadi fulfilling the functions of notaries.®*\n\nZ.

Adler collection, now in the library of the Jewish\nTheological Seminary of America, New York, and another in the\nTaylor-Schechter Collection of the University Library, Cambridge,\nEngland, both identified by Friedman; but all four together are\nstill far from providing us with a complete text.\n\nIn addition to marriage contracts proper the Geniza contains\ncourt records drafting or reproducing such contracts or otherwise\nrelated to them, as well as notes of judges summarizing the main\npoints of a ketubba in preparation for the issuance of a document.\nFinally, settlements arranged during marital life, or after its\ntermination by death or repudiation, as well as dispositions in\ncontemplation of death, often have opportunity to refer to stipula-\ntions made at the conclusion of the marriage. Occasionally such\nsettlements are written on the reverse side of the original ketubba.\n\nAs is natural, this variegated material originated in widely\ndifferent times, places, and situations. Therefore utmost circum-\nspection is required in its study. To this caveat another and most\npertinent consideration must be added. Both because of its legal\nand sentimental value the ketubba was a most valuable possession\nand was carefully kept by the wife or her family. When it got lost, it\nhad to be replaced immediately.” How, then, did ketubbas get into\nthe Geniza? Mostly, it stands to reason, they ended up in it when\nthere was trouble, when the document had to be produced in court\nand was torn up, after the litigation had led to a settlement.

Who applied to the\ncourts? Disputes over marriage stipulations could occur anywhere.\nBut families that were better off were able to make proper\narrangements to forestall such emergencies (see B, 2, above), and\npreferred to settle their differences in private. It was the poor,\nthose harrassed by dire circumstances and unable to make a good\nmatch in the first place, who were forced to have recourse to the\ncourts. In view of this consideration, we might suspect that the\ngeneral testimony of the Geniza documents on marriage is some-\nwhat lopsided, leaning heavily toward the lower and lowest strata\nof society.\n\nIn order to avoid the pitfalls of both generalization and one-\nsidedness, we must single out specific groups of documents, each\nrepresenting a reasonable measure of unity, a unity that would\nprevail, for instance, where documents were written by one judge\nor clerk, or in one single period, or originated in one type of\nenvironment, or reflected a particular situation. On the other\nhand, in order to form a productive object of study, the group\nmust be fairly comprehensive and diversified. In the Appendix\n“The Economics of Marriage,” part I, I have assembled eight\ngroups of ketubbas and related papers which, I hope, meet those\ndemands and thus facilitate the approach to an understanding of\nthe realities of marriage in Geniza times.\n\nThe first group is a selection of thirty-seven documents all from\nFustat and all written by the judge Mevorakh, son of the judge\nNathan b. Samuel (see Med. Soc., 11, 513, sec. 18, 514, sec. 22).\nTwenty-six are from the ten years between 1155 and 1165 (ten of\nthem originating in the course of one summer, 1156), nine are not\ndatable, and two are from a slightly later period but of special\ninterest: they are acknowledgments of the receipts of trousseaux\nin times of unrest. They were added in order to show the situation\nafter the pillage and burning of Fustat in 1168.\n\nIn addition to their inner coherence, Mevorikh’s documents\nare especially valuable inasmuch as in his court, or perhaps in his\ntime in general, it was customary (or obligatory) to list the actual\nprices of the items of dowries and not sums inflated in honor of the\nbride or her family.\n\nNathan, Mevorakh’s father, wrote the more interesting and\nmore important Geniza documents on marriage. But his total\nwitness on the subject is not as massive and compact as that of his\nson. Therefore, I have preferred to select seventeen of Nathan’s\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In this group, too, the prices of the items of\nthe dowry are realistic.\n\nProceeding chronologically, group 3 contains the oldest mar-\nriage contract completely preserved, issued in Damascus in 933,\nand eight other documents from the same city and period. In\nvarious respects this is a special group comprised of both rich and\npoor people.\n\nGroup 4 is widely diffused in both space and time. It comprises\neight major cities: the twin cities of Cairo and Fustat; Jerusalem;\nTyre, Lebanon; Aleppo, Syria; Tinnis, one of the two eastern\nMediterranean ports of Egypt;® Barqa, then the capital of Cyre-\nnaica, or eastern Libya; and Qayrawin, then the capital of Tunisia.\nIts span of time is about eighty years (960—1039). This was a\nperiod of transition, when many of the old usages and local\nvariations were still alive, as is illustrated by the details provided in\nthe Appendix, group 4, and in B, 4-5, below. Provincial towns and\nvillages are excluded. The often quoted marriage contract from\nthe Byzantine town of Mastaura, Asia Minor, of 1022, is not listed\neither because its very special conditions do not lend themselves to\nmeaningful inclusion in a schematic table.*\n\nThe streamlined uniformity of the twelfth century is reflected in\ngroup 5 (1105—1135). The legal framework underlying those\ncontracts and court records is uniform: the diversified socioeco-\nnomic conditions are responsible for the variations. This was the\nperiod of the court clerk Halfon ha-Levi b. Manasse (see Med.\nSoc., 11, 231), and most of the documents listed in this section are\nindeed from his hand. Since the number of fragments written by\nHalfon and his contemporaries is endless, the group, with few\nexceptions, is confined to dated pieces. A glance at the sums in the\nlist of marriage gifts and dowries shows that in this large group the\nnumber of couples belonging to the poorer strata of society was\nconsiderably higher than in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. In reality, the\ndiscrepancy was perhaps even greater, for we know both from\ninstructions written by Halfon b. Manasse and from actual ex-\namples that in his time (or his office) it was customary to list the\nitems of the dowry with double the actual price. This matter is\ndiscussed in B, 4, below.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

To this must be added that\nJudge Nathan, like his son Mevorakh after him, seems to have\ninsisted on the prices of the trousseaux being realistic.\n\nGroup 7, marriage documents from the Egyptian Rif, clearly\nfalls into two sections, one from larger, and another from smaller\nprovincial towns, the latter sometimes being merely populous\nvillages. Qalyiib, because of the nearness of the capital (see Med.\nSoc., 11, 257), is a case by itself.\n\nGroup 8, “Remarrying one’s divorcée,” was brought together in\norder to find out whether rash and ill-considered divorces were a\ngeneral social evil or confined mainly to the lower social classes.\nThe answer provided by the list is self-evident.\n\nPart I1 of the Appendix summarizes the main aspects of the\neconomics of marriage in general. About six hundred documents\nwere examined, but since most of them are fragmentary, or do not\ninclude information pertinent to the table, the total number listed\nis far smaller than six hundred.\n\nThe first question to be asked in examining a marriage docu-\nment relates to the personal circumstances of the young couple:\nwas it the first or the second or still another marriage of the bride,\nfor the socioeconomic conditions accompanying each diftered\nconsiderably.

In B, 4, below, I discuss the conclu-\nsions to be drawn from these rich, but checkered, sources of\ninformation.\n\nWhat does the Geniza marriage contract tell us?—An attempt to\nsurvey systematically the contents of the Geniza ketubbas may seem\nfutile after having said that no two are identical. It might be useful,\nhowever, to learn what kind of data we can expect to find in a\nketubba, and how frequently each item occurs.\n\nLike any other legal document, the ketubba normally opens by\nstating the exact time and place where it was executed. The date is\ngiven according to one or several of the various Jewish eras, in\naddition to those explained in Med. Soc., 1, 355—357, especially\nthe era of the destruction of the Second Temple (which reminds\none of the Coptic “era of the martyrs” of A.p. 284),° and that of\nthe “weeks” of the Jubilee periods of fifty years (faintly resembling\nthe Byzantine indictions).® The latter two are common in ketubbas\naccording to the usage of the Land of Israel.\n\nThe locality is regularly defined geographically, such as “Fustat,\nEgypt, which is situated on the Nile River,” but also administra-\ntively, by naming the head of the Jewish community, to whose\nauthority the legal action incorporated in the document was\nsubject. In Mamluk times an atrociously long list of honorific\nepithets was attached to the name. In the twelfth century the head\nof the community took pride of place in the good wishes preceding\nthe text proper, as discussed below.\n\nSome groups of Geniza ketubbas contain the assurances nor-\nmally found in legal documents, namely, that the parties were in\nfull command of their physical and mental faculties, that they acted\nout of free will, were not coerced or in error, that the document\nwas executed in accordance with the strictest provisions of Jewish\n(and gentile) law, and so on; others, the majority, do not. Those\nmatters, are of interest for the history of the ketubba, but not for\nsocial histery, with which we are concerned here.\n\nThe first item requiring our attention is the status of the bride.\nShe is usually described as a virgin, which simply means that this\nwas her first marriage.” They were not particular about virginity in\nthose parts and days, or, rather, were barred by good taste from\nspeaking about such matters.

A. Friedman and I have found only one case in\nwhich virginity formed an object of contention. The story is too\nfunny not to be told. The husband, a Mr. Cohen—that is, of a\npriestly family—quarreled with his in-laws years after his wife had\nborne him a son. In the heat of the squabble he said: “The woman I\nhave taken from you was not a virgin.” When things calmed down,\nhe backed down and declared that he had lied. But a new judge\nwho arrived in the town and learned about the matter declared that\nMr. Cohen’s progeny was to be deprived of the priestly privileges\n(such as pronouncing the blessing over the congregation [Numbers\n6:23—27] or leading it in the reading of the Torah). It was a gross\nblunder on the part of the learned judge, since only the high priest\nis bound to marry a virgin (Leviticus 21:13), whereas any other\nKohen is only prohibited from marrying a divorcée. Finally, when\nthe grandsons of Mr. Cohen had grown up and become respectable\nmembers of the community, a new judge appearing on the scene\nrectified the matter.?\n\nAnother case from this period, not reported in the Geniza, but\nknown from the Responsa of Abraham Maimonides, was decided by\nthe master in a way that must have deterred any groom from\nclaiming that the bride did not have the status professed in the\nketubba; not only had he no right to reclaim what he had already\npaid as his main marriage gift, but he was obliged to pay also what\nhe had promised.'® Still, it is perhaps characteristic for a rarionally\nminded city population that the obsession with virginity, which was\nrampant in less-developed communities, seems to have been next\nto absent.\n\nWhat has been just said seems to be contradicted by the Karaite\nceremonial where the kerchief with the virgin blood was actually\nshown to witnesses and blessed. The Karaites, we remember, were\nthe most advanced, or, at least, richest, section of the community.\nBut here, as in many other cases, the Karaites simply took the Bible\nliterally (Deuteronomy 22:13—21, especially verse 17), or pre-\nserved ancient custom, or were influenced by their Muslim envi-\nronment, or all these three agencies acted in unison.\"\n\nWhen the bride was a divorcée or a widow, or both, or “a virgin\ndivorced after betrothal,”*? this was stated too, but there was no\n\nGoitein, S.

Occasionally, one tried to avoid\nany unpleasant memories and the bride was described as “(pre-\nsently) unmarried,” or “the woman” (Karaites)'* or “previously\nmarried.”\" A freedwoman, or a captive who had been ransomed\nalso would be designated as such, and occasionally the name of a\nwidow’s former husband is mentioned.'®\n\nSuch distinctions were necessary, because an ancient law stipu-\nlated that the minimum obligatory marriage gift to a virgin was\n200 zuz (silver pieces) and that to any other woman, 100. In the\nGeniza period 200 ziiz were regarded as worth 25 dirhems, which\nmeant that a woman not a virgin received 12% dirhems. Mostly\nit is not said expressly, or evident by the wording of the ketubba,\nwhether these payments of the minimum obligatory nuptial gift\nwere actually made in silver pieces or were included in the main\nmarriage gift, which was promised and delivered invariably in gold\n(or its value). The Karaites made the same distinction, but fixed 50\nsilver pieces for a virgin and 25 for other brides. They differed\nfrom the Rabbanites in this matter not because they were richer—\nalthough that might have contributed to the distinction—but\nbecause, as always, they clung to the word of the Bible\n(Deuteronomy 22:29, see also 22:19).'¢\n\nThese minutize of Jewish law are helpful inasmuch as they\nreveal to us—even where the details about the status of the bride\nare lost—whether a woman married for the first or a consecutive\ntime. To my astonishment I found that about 45 percent or more\nof all brides of the Geniza period had stood under the wedding\ncanopy more than once in their lives. This remarkable social\nphenomenon is analyzed in C, 3, and discussed in connection with\nthe general position of women in D,\n\nMuslim marriage contracts from this period regularly contain the\nremark that the bride had come of age.'” The Karaites, whose\nusages were in many respects similar to those of the Muslims, do\nthe same, and formulate this notion beautifully, “a girl able to fulfill\nthe religious duties,” for many commandments had to be observed\nby a married Jewish woman.” In most of the Geniza ketubbas,\nthose of the Rabbanite community, this detail is provided only\nsporadically, although it is found throughout six centuries.’ It was\nredundant because the very fact that the bride makes one or more\nlegally valid declarations in the marriage contracts proves that she\nhas come of age.\n\nThe personal names of groom and bride are defined by those of\ntheir fathers; their mothers are never mentioned. The reason, of\ncourse, was that the name of a man’s father was his family name.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

This detail is important because whether or not a\nperson was orphaned was of considerable influence on one’s socio-\neconomic position. Here, however, we encounter the difficulty that\nmany of our papers are drafts of notes or enclosures, such as lists of\ntrousseaux, where the clerks did not bother to include the relevant\nblessings.\n\nThe occupation of the groom, or his father, is indicated, it seems,\nonly when the occupation formed part of the name by which a\nperson was known, such as Bu I-Barakat al-‘attar (the perfumer)\nor Bu ’l-Makarim al-s@’igh (the goldsmith), both followed by their\nfull Hebrew names.?* It is also indicated in special instances, as\nwhen a cantor marries the daughter of a beadle.?® But even wherea\nwidow is promised that her future husband will teach her son his\nprofession, we are not told what it is.2®\n\nIn many marriage contracts, especially in the more ancient ones,\nwhich are executed according to the Palestinian rite, and in all the\nKaraite ketubbas the bride appoints a representative, and his name\nand those of the two persons witnessing the appointment are\nmentioned.

In most other documents, especially those formulated\naccording to the standard (Babylonian) custom, this detail is absent.\n\nIt cannot be sufficiently stressed that the proxy mentioned in the\nketubba differs essentially from the wali, or guardian, of the\nMuslim marriage law (see B, 2, above). Epitropos was the word\nused throughout the Geniza period to an agent appointed by a\nperson to serve as his or her representative.

On the\nother hand, it is not excluded that they remained faithful to ancient\nPalestinian custom more strongly than the majority of the Jews who\nhad adopted Babylonian usages.\n\nTurning now to the substance of the ketubba, a note on the term\nitself is in place.®® Its meaning is simply “a written statement”\n(on the obligations of the husband toward his spouse). Although\nthe actual documents spell out also the duties of the future wife,\nmostly in general terms, the essence of the ketubba is the husband’s\nfinancial responsibility, wherefore it is the wife who receives and\nkeeps the ketubba. Some marriage contracts describe the husband’s\nobligations regarding the delayed marriage gift to be paid at a\ndivorce or the husband’s death simply as hov (Heb.), a debt,\nwhile a late document characterizes the dowry as a loan.*®\n\nUnder the general meaning of obligation the term “ketubba”\nassumes three different meanings, two of which, strangely enough,\nare used side by side in the standard marriage contracts of the\nGeniza. First it designates the obligatory minimum gift of 25 or\n12% silver pieces, wherefore, close to the beginning of the contract\nthis statement is found: “He added to her ketubba such-and-such\na sum of gold pieces as an additional gift.” Second, it comprises all\nthe dues from the husband, including the return of the dowry,\nwherefore we read near the end: “Thus, the total of her ketubba,\nnamely mohar [which stands here for the minimum nuptial gift],\nadditional gift, and dowry, amounts to such-and-such a sum.”®\nInformally, in the phrase, “ketubba and dowry,” the term refers to\nthe late marriage gift that the husband owes his wife.\n\nThe stereotyped general promises made by the groom and\nreciprocated by the bride have been discussed.?* It is remarkable\nthat the full maintenance promised by the groom contains only\nfood and clothing, but does not make mention of living quarters.\nThe Jewish marriage contracts from San‘a, the capital of Yemen,\ninvariably included the obligation that the husband should provide\na domicile for his wife inside the Jewish quarter with entrance and\nexits within that quarter. The absence of the stipulation in the\nGeniza contracts (and in most other ketubbas) had its root in the\nassumption that a man acquires a house, or is accommodated in his\nfather’s house, before his marriage.

        "text": "viii, B, 3 Wedding and the Marriage Contract 105\n\nTalmudic maxim reflecting Jewish life in late antiquity. By\nMaimonides’ own time social conditions had fundamentally\nchanged, and, as we shall presently see, the problem of living\nquarters looms large in the documents concerning marital\nrelations.®*\n\nThe groom’s “additional”—in reality, main—marriage gift is\nbroken down thus: first the total sum is given, followed by the\nimmediate, usually smaller, installment, of which it is often stated\nthat it had been received and acknowledged by the bride; the\ndelayed installment, to be paid at a divorce or the death of the\nhusband, comes at the end. Since most of the marriage contracts\nare fragmentary, this arrangement often helps us to reconstruct\nthe details (see the introductory remark to the Appendix).\n\nSubsequent to the groom’s marriage gift, the bride’s dowry is\nnoted, usually detailing each item with its price, but sometimes\n(rarely) only providing the total value of the trousseau. The dowry\nis introduced by the phrase: “This is what [or simply: and] she\nbrought in from the house of her father,” the oldest and probably\nthe most common form, occasionally replaced by “from the\nwomen’s quarters.”*® That phrase is sometimes expanded to a more\npious version: “This is what she brought in with her from the All-\nmerciful and from the house of her fathers” [in the plural].®\nAn ancient village ketubba simply states: “And this is what came in\nwith her.” But even the very formalistic court clerk Halfon b.\nManasse writes this about a virgin whose father was dead: “This\nis the dowry which she brought to him from her own.” The bride\nconcerned, ‘Ama’im, clearly was a working woman; we shall hear\nabout her later.*\n\nThese economic foundations of the marriage, the husband’s\ncontributions and the wife’s dowry, are studied in detail in B, 4.\n\nThe main part of the ketubba is followed by a list of stipulations,\nsome long, some short. which fall into three categories: (1) gen-\neral items, found in most documents and summarily called “the\nwell-known conditions,” or “the well-known conditions imposed by\nthe daughters of Israel”;* (2) fairly common items; and (3) spe-\ncific items related to the special circumstances of the couple.\n\nThe first item in the first category, found in the majority of\nmarriage contracts, is the postulate that the wife be regarded as\ntrustworthy in the conduct of her household (and other financial\nmatters—not included everywhere), and that no oath could be\nimposed on her in this matter by her husband or his heirs. This\ndetail goes back to biblical times, when the Israelite peasant woman\nheld the reins of the farm in her hands, while her husband went\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The social conditions of the Geniza period, naturally, were\nradically different from those of ancient Israel, but the stipulation\nof trustworthiness still was of vital importance for marital peace\nand the wife’s economic security.\n\nSecond and third in frequency were the husband’s promises not\nto marry another wife and not to keep a maid disapproved by his\nspouse. These prohibitions, too, have a long history behind them.\n\nMany conditions were connected with the dowry, the most\ncommon being that half of it would return to the wife’s family\nshould she die without offspring, male or female. This originally\nPalestinian usage became more or less generally accepted. The\nKaraites, interestingly, stipulated that the entire dowry of a woman\ndying without child should go back to her father’s house; more-\nover, according to them, during her lifetime the husband was not\npermitted to take any action with the dowry without informing and\nconsulting his wife.\n\nNot “well-known,” but still frequently found, were the stipula-\ntions in the second category dealing with such questions as the\ndomicile of the young couple, deciding whether the husband or the\nwife had the prerogative of choosing it, and touching on a wide\nvariety of other matters connected with this issue; or, whether a\nwife’s earnings by work were her personal property, or belonged to\nher husband, or could be retained by her only if she provided for\nher clothing from her earnings; or, the condition that a husband\nshould not travel abroad (or even outside the couple’s city) without\nthe consent of his wife and without making provision for her\nmaintenance in his absence and in case death overcame him while\naway.\n\nThe third category, stipulations occasioned by special circum-\nstances is, naturally, greatly varied: the cost of the wedding, the\nrelationship of the spouses with members of the two families,\nchildren brought in from a previous marriage, the freedom of\nmovement of the wife, and her treatment in general. These\nconditions indicale that the two contracting parties knew each\nother well and were taking precautions.\n\nIn addition to these three categories of stipulations, which reflect\nthe realities of life in the Geniza period, there is a fourth which may\nbe characterized as traditional, that is, a stipulation that was in\n\nGoitein, S.

Most of the laws represented by these details were still in\nforce, but, for one reason or another, were no longer included in\nthe common marriage contracts. One condition, for instance,\nprovided that if a wife was taken captive (which often also meant\nraped), her husband was obliged to ransom her not with her\ndowry, but with his own money, to bring her back, and to live with\nher without grudge. One easily understands why such a condition,\nalthough very vital in turbulent times, was dropped from the\nregular ketubba.\n\nFinally, there are stipulations concerned with religious obser-\nvances, for instance, in connection with the frequent cases of mixed\nmarriages between Karaites and Rabbanites, and, after the reforms\nintroduced by Moses Maimonides (late twelfth century), the so-\ncalled laws of purity. They are normally spelled out at the end of\nthe marriage contract, and the wife is warned that if she fails to\nobserve them she will lose her marriage gift.\n\nThe social safeguards contained in the ketubba, as surveyed\nabove, are studied in B, 5. We shall not come back to the\nstipulations described as traditional nor to those concerned with\nreligious observances. The interesting divorce clause included in\nthe ketubbas of the Land of Israel is briefly treated in C, 3.\n\nPhysical features.—In conclusion, something must be said about\nthe physical features of the Geniza ketubba.

But in order to honor and to please the young couple,\nthe number of witnesses signing a marriage contract was greater\nand they were selected to fit the occasion. This detail is discussed\nbelow in connection with the wedding ceremonies.\n\nA special feature is the expression of good wishes heading the\nketubba, normally arranged in larger characters and often also ina\ndifferent type of script (for instance, monumental and quadrangu-\nlar script, with the text in cursive). The most common wish, “may\nthey build and succeed,” meaning “may they be blessed with\nchildren,” has been discussed.®® Second in frequency are the good\nwishes expressing the idea that marriage is a matter of luck, thus\nreferring to the relations between husband and wife.

The astrologi-\ncal background of these wishes is evident, but an additional idea\nis involved: if a man is successful with his marriage, he will prosper\notherwise and be a blessing to his environment.*\n\nThis idea, that marriage is not a private affair, but concerns the\ncommunity at large, is very prominent in the good wishes orna-\nmenting the Geniza documents. The oldest ketubba fragment\nfound thus far in the Geniza (dated 870) bears this superscription:\n“With a good sign for us and for all Israel, in a propitious hour\nhere [and everywhere], with a high star for us and all Israel. .. .”*\nThe most common superscriptions of the late eleventh and subse-\nquent centuries rhyme kalla, bride, with gehilla, congregation, and,\nwhere appropriate, include the head of the community, negid\nha-gola.*s Once the propensity for rhyming was let loose, many\nother good wishes having the same rhyme were added. The\nKaraites, always aware of the obligation to set Jerusalem above\none’s personal joy (Psalms 137:6), wish the young couple to be\ngranted “to rejoice in Jerusalem’s joy” and, in general, express\nmessianic hopes in many different ways.* One Rabbanite ketubba\n(not from the Egyptian capital) is headed by a long poem—\nexceptional in a Rabbanite ketubba—saturated with messianic\nyearnings; the bridegroom was a cantor, a vocation paired with the\navocation of writing poetry (see Med. Soc., 11, 220—221); 1 suspect\nthe young man authored the poem himself and wished to im-\nmortalize it by its inclusion in his marriage contract.*”\n\nAnother way of blessing the young couple was to adorn its\nmarriage contract with telling verses from the Bible. To exhaust\nthis topic would lead us deep into the intricate problem of the\nusage of the Bible in medieval writings. The most obvious and\nappropriate verse, “He who has found a wife, has found happiness\nand obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22) is next to\nabsent because the name of God was avoided in the standard\nketubba.*® The prominent court clerk Japheth b. David used it\nconstantly, but cut off the words “from the Lord” and wrote,\ninstead, a rhyme “obtains favor and a propitious hour.”* The\nother relevant verse from the Book of Proverbs (19:14), “House\nand property are inherited from the forefathers, but a capable wife\nis from the Lord,” is rare for the same reason; as superscription, I\nhave found it only in a sixteenth-century ketubba, far beyond the\nperiod with which we are concerned here.*® A third verse from\nProverbs (20:24) unconnected with marriage, “A man’s steps are of\nthe Lord,” serves as a superscription, because it emphasizes, like\n\nGoitein, S.

The reference to Elkana’s love\nfor his wife Hanna (I Samuel 1:8) is found in a poetical proem and\nis absolutely exceptional.*!\n\nMost Bible quotations selected convey the notions of joyfulness\nand happiness, either referring directly to weddings such as Ruth\n4:11-12, and Jeremiah 33, 11,* or by describing the jubilant\nreunion of God and Israel in the simile of a matrimonial bond, as\nexpressed in many verses in the later part of the Book of Isaiah and\nof several other prophets. References to the creation of Adam and\nEve, such as “It is not good for man to be alone; I will make him a\nhelper fit for him” (Genesis 2:18) are rare, and, as superscriptions,\nconfined to Karaite ketubbas,* where we also find the most appro-\npriate quotation: “I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth\nyou to me in truth and lawfulness, in steadfast love and com-\npassion” (Hosea 2:19).%*\n\nThe good wishes and Bible quotations not only expressed the\nnotion of joyfulness, but also intended to create it by their beautiful\nexecution. This aesthetic aspect of the ketubba needs careful\nconsideration; it brought home the idea that the marriage contract\nwas not merely a legal instrument conveying rights, but a bond of\nalmost magical power keeping the newly married spouses united.\nWe are here in a period when writing was an art exercised, as a\nrule, only by professional people (see Med. Soc., 11, 178—179,\n228). Women were for the most part illiterate; men were able to\nread the Bible and other books written in monumental script, but\nthe fleeting cursive used in documents and letters required unusual\nexertion from them, if they were capable of mastering it at all.\nTherefore it was (and still is) customary to read out the ketubba to\nthe young couple (or to the bridegroom alone) at the wedding. In\nview of all this it was the look of the ketubba which counted. In his\nbrilliant paper, “Arabic Epigraphy: Communication or Symbolic\nAffirmation,” Richard Ettinghausen has shown that inscriptions on\nmosques and other public buildings (including the mosque of the\nIslamic Center in Washington, D.C.) often were executed in such a\nway that they could hardly be read by the uninitiated. Rather, they\nwere destined to express the importance of the building and the\ngreatness of God or the ruler to whom it was dedicated.?® A similar\nattitude is to be assumed with regard to the ketubba: for the wife\nwho kept it, it must have been like a charm protecting her\nmarriage.\n\nTake the case of the second marriage of the divorcée Turfa\n(“Precious Gift”), one of the poorest women mentioned in the\nGeniza documents.

But her ketubba\nof December 1124 is written in beautiful regular script on a large\npiece of vellum, 30 cm (12\") broad, and about 38 cm or more long.\nWide blank spaces are left between the lines, as was customary in\nthe Fatimid chancelleries, and the heading with the good wishes is\nartistically arranged: five groups of two words each, divided from\none another by blank spaces of about the same size, form the first\nline, four, the second, and another five, the last; each of the\nuppermost groups is crowned by a fleur-de-lis design about twice as\nhigh as the letters. I have little doubt that the poor couple made a\nspecial financial effort for getting such a beautiful ketubba, for two\ncontemporary ketubbas written in exactly the same arrangement\nfor people in somewhat better circumstances are less well done.*\n\nThus far, the students of medieval ornamental art have paid\nlittle attention to the illuminations of Geniza marriage contracts.\nThe most recent pertinent publications include reproductions of\nonly two ketubbas from that source, and without discussing them\naesthetically or historically. Because of the large size of the docu-\nments concerned and their fragmentary state any relevant publica-\ntion will encounter difficulties. But I believe it is an attractive topic,\nas the subsequent short remarks, I hope, show.*”\n\nBible manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuries display an\nattempt to enhance the beauty of the script with geometrical and\nfloral designs, with or without colors. What we have in the Geniza\nketubbas seems to be the end rather than the beginning of a\ntradition, or more exactly, the waning of one and the start of\nothers. The possible connections with contemporary Coptic and\nIslamic art must always be kept in mind.*®\n\nThe illuminated ketubba TS 16.73 of the year 1030/1, one of the\noldest preserved, is fairly contemporary with the beautiful Bible\nlection discussed in Med. Soc., II, 152. The script of the text is\ncursive, but by making the letters strictly symmetrical and vertical\nand by leaving four times as much space between the lines as the\nheight of the letters, the same effect is reached as by using\nquadrangular letters: the text looks like a piece of textile adorned\nby bands. In order to avoid monotony the letter / is lengthened\nso that its long neck protrudes into the major part of the blank\nspaces. Those familiar with Islamic decorative writing may jump to\nthe conclusion that this is an imitation of Arabic I or al, so often\ncompared by poets to a slim, tall damsel.

The ornamental\nfigures and letters of this line are in gold with red contours, while\nthe next (originally third) line is in red with black outlines. The\nfleur-de-lis above the middle group of good wishes (the only one\nvisible) in line 3 has black outlines, not filled in.

Lively vowel signs soften\nthe austerity of the perfectly drawn monuamental letters.

The most common form was\nquadrangles or quadruple quadrangles of micrographic lines\nhaving as their centers mostly eight-petaled flowers. As already\nmentioned, the origin of the geometric lines in tiny script is in the\ntradition of Bible manuscripts, whereas the proliferation of floral\ndesigns is to be sought in the text of the headings: the basic wish,\n“may they build and succeed,” is regularly followed by the rhyme,\n“and bloom and flourish.”®” Another filling consisted of Bible\nquotations written in huge letters contrasting with the minuscules\nof the borders. In one case, the band has the form of a vertical\ntabula ansata with no filling at all. In another, a Karaite ketubba, the\nmarginal decoration consists solely of large, hollow letters.®\n\nGoitein, S. D.

According to Islamic custom, the ceremonial proces-\nsion of the bride to her husband’s house and subsequent consum-\nmation took place on Thursday night, which is “the night of\nFriday,” the holy weekday of Islam.®\n\nConsiderations of thrift caused people to hold their weddings\nimmediately before holidays, especially Passover in the spring and\nthe Feast of Tabernacle in the fall, or on Purim, which (like\ncarnival) was a day of merriment rather than a holy day.

Housing is not expressly\nmentioned as an obligation because it was taken for granted that\nmarriage means “bringing one’s wife into his own home,” that is,\neither the house of the family of the groom’s father or one owned\nor rented by the groom himself. “By entering my house you will\nbecome my wife,” was an ancient ketubba form.! This assumption\nwas so general that a Talmudic source states: “When an orphan\nwishes to marry, one [that is, the community] rents for him a house,\nprovides it with bedding, and then marries him to a wife.” In\nconnection with this Saul Lieberman draws attention to a lovely\nJewish building inscription in Greek, which says: “May God, who\nhas helped with building this house, help also with the marriage.”\n\nThe general obligation of a husband to provide for his wife finds\nits tangible expression at the time of the marriage, namely, in the\npartial delivery and partial promise of the marriage gift, usually\nconsisting of three parts: the minimum obligatory nuptial gift,\nreferred to either with the biblical méhar, or the postbiblical ketub-\nba,* the immediate installment of the “additional,” but, in reality,\nmain, marriage gift, of which it is often stated that the bride has al-\nready received it (as was common also in Muslim marriage con-\ntracts), and the delayed installment, to be paid by the husband in the\neventof a divorce or by the husband’s heirs after his demise.\n\nNaturally, the legal minimum of 25 dirhems to be given a woman\nat her first marriage, corresponding to 200 ziz, or silver pieces, in\nTalmudic times, cannot enlighten us on the economic efforts\nrequired from the husband. That sum was given, or at least noted,\nin order to fulfill a religious injunction, and, in many cases, it is not\nevident if this payment of silver money was actually made or was\nincluded in the main gift, which was invariably in gold.® Yet the\nlegal minimum of 200 ziz conveys a message. At the time it was in\nforce, a man whose possessions amounted to this sum had no claim\non public charity.® In Islamic law we find a similar ceiling of 200\nsilver pieces for the right to receive alms; thus a common Near\nEastern tradition probably existed in this matter.” In any case,\nfixing the minimum marriage gift at that sum means that at\nmarriage a man had to prove that he was able to sustain himself.®\nTo what extent this principle was adhered to in Geniza times might\nbe learned, at least partly, from the main marriage gifts given and\npromised in our documents.\n\nIn Med.

We have to discern here\namong the historical origins, the legal formulation, and the socio-\neconomic realities. as reflected in the Geniza documents. The two-\nstage contribution of the husband, one toward the wedding\nexpenses and other immediate needs of the future wife and the\nother toward her material security after the termination of the\nmarriage, has its roots in hoary antiquity. Talmudic law and\npractice laid the emphasis on the latter, on “the debt” the husband\nowes his wife, or, as some ancient documents have it, his “responsi-\nbility for her ketubba.” The Arab-Muslim mahr was essentially a\nbride price, a payment to be made at the wedding, but one that\ncould be deferred to one or several later installments, the dates of\nwhich, often only months or a few years, usually were fixed in the\nmarriage contract. Thus the two institutions are instrinsically\ndifferent. It seems, however that the terms “early” and “late”\n(installments) were adapted to Muslim usage. Likewise, the phrase\nfound in most marriage contracts: “[he added to the obligatory\nnuptial gift] such-and-such a sum, of which he gave her such-and-\nsuch a sum as a gift at the time of the wedding [the receipt of which\nshe has confirmed], while such-and-such a sum remained on his\nneck as a debt” is also similar in formulation to Muslim documents,\nalthough in substance it is pre-Islamic. Such an adaptation to\nMuslim legal parlance was necessary, for ketubbas frequently were\nbrought before the state authorities, since in family matters the\nminority courts acted as representatives of the government.'®\n\nThe overwhelming testimony of the Geniza documents proves\nthat the minimum cash payment required from a groom at\nmarriage was 5 dinars. We had an inkling of this above.'\" Before\ntrying to evaluate the socioeconomic significance of this fact, the\ninstances of immediate payments of less than 5 dinars must be\nbriefly surveyed. These were remarriages to onc’s divorcée,™\nmarriages to divorcées with or without child,”* to widows with or\nwithout child,\" in general to women marrying a second or third\n\nGoitein, S. D.

One is reminded, of course, that the\nstandard exchange value of a dinar was 40 dirhems, so that with 5\ndinars we are back to the 200 silver pieces of the obligatory\nmarriage gift of late antiquity. I doubt, however, that there was a\ndirect historical sequence, and am rather inclined to see the\nconnecting link in the mysterious betrothal gift mentioned in some\nGeniza texts of 4 1/6 dinars, which was later upped to 5 dinars.”\nThis sum is clearly related to the obligatory minimum marriage gift\nof 8% dinars (2 x 4 1/6), known from “Jerusalem” (that is, customs\nderived from what once was customary in Palestine), Asia Minor,\nand elsewhere, the equivalent of the ancient 200 ziiz.** Such changes\nwere brought about by monetary developments in early Islamic\ntimes and contemporary adaptation to them by Jewish law. That we\nshall ever be able to disentangle these complex relationships is\ndoubtful. Here we are called upon to evaluate the fact that during\nmost of the classical Geniza period, a minimum of 5 dinars was\ndelivered as first installment of the marriage gift at, or before, the\nwedding.\n\nIn order to appreciate what this meant in practice we have to\nremind ourselves of the perennial scarcity of specie so often\nreferred to in these volumes. People often experienced hardships\nin this matter, the wealthier because they put every available dinar\nto work, and the less fortunate simply because they had none. Med.\nSoc., I1, 380 ff., shows what a nightmare the yearly payment of the\npoll tax was for many members of the minority communities,\nalthough those in the lower groups of taxpayers had to deliver only\n1 or 2 dinars. One lived on what one earned, and little was left over\nfor extras. A gift of 5 gold pieces, on top of the expenses for\nhousing and other matters connected with a marriage, required a\nserious effort on the part of a groom of the lower classes. Thus, the\noriginal purpose of the law that fixed an obligatory minimum\nmarriage gift incumbent on the groom was taken care of by the\ncustom evidenced by the Geniza documents: a man should not\nmarry before he had proved that he was able to maintain a\nhousehold. This is by no means a truism, since many societies are\nknown where such an attitude toward marriage was not para-\nmount—for one, the traditional Jewish community of Eastern\nEurope (from which most American Jews derive their origin),\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "122 Marriage viii, B, 4\n\nwhere the young couple often lived in the house of the wife’s\nparents years before the husband became economically\nindependent.\n\nThe customary minimum cash payment of 5 dinars by the groom\nbecomes even more significant in view of the “delayed installment”\nthat goes with it on the one hand, and the higher levels of cash\npayments on the other. A cursory perusal of the Appendix, PartI1,\nshows that grooms paying 5 dinars as first installment usually\npromised late installments of 20 or 15 dinars, less often 25 or 30\ndinars, and even less often, 10. Those making payments above or\nbelow these sums were exceptional. Thus the general assumption\nwas that a man making the minimum cash payment of 5 dinars at\nthe wedding would be able to lay aside for his wife an average of\nabout three to five times as much during his lifetime or, rather, the\nduration of his marriage. The sums actually disbursed at death or\ndivorce indicate that this assumption was not unrealistic. Naturally,\nwe also hear of husbands who were either unable or unwilling to\nlive up to their obligations.**\n\nThe picture in the next group, those making a wedding gift of 10\ndinars,* is different. Here the average of the delayed installment\namounts to less than three times the initial payment, which means\nthat, while a special effort was made at the conclusion of the\nmarriage contract, the economic prospects of the husband in\ngenerai were not tangibly better than that of the preceding group.\nThe two groups together represent the poor and those in modest\nor very modest circumstances, about one-half of the population.\nBeneath them were the paupers, forming about one-sixth of the\ntotal.\n\nThe next and far less numerous layer of society consisted of\nthose who gave wedding gifts of 15 or 20 dinars to which was\nadded a delayed installment of 40—60 dinars, the lower middle\nclass. Persons from the upper middle class gave 30 to 50 dinars as\nearly, and 50 to 100 dinars as late, marriage gifts. The two groups\ntogether amounted to about one-third of the whole. This distri-\nbution seems to indicate that there was a marked cleavage between\nthe lower and upper middle classes.*®\n\nThere was an even more pronounced gap between the well-off\nand the rich, those who made a cash payment of 100 dinars or\nmore at the wedding and promised a delayed installment of about\n200 dinars. With one exception, first installments of 60, 70, 80, or\n90 dinars have not been noted. If you wished to show that you were\nreally rich, you had to lay a hundred dinars on the table and come\nup with a total marriage gift of 300 dinars. About 5 percent of the\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Mortgaging a specific piece of property for this purpose\nwas uncommon. But at the sale of any immovables by the husband\nthe wife’s consent was required, a situation well reflected in the\nGeniza papers.*\n\nDid the husband’s marriage gift, as analyzed above, fulfill its\neconomic function? Did it provide for the wife in the case of a\ndivorce or at the husband’s death? The average of 25 to 35 dinars,\npromised by the members of the lower classes, certainly was an\nawesome deterrent against divorce and thus protected the wife\nfrom rash actions of her spouse. Nor were these sums negligible as\na means of sustenance. Cash was difficult to come by; therefore it\nwas worth more than its purchasing value. A woman giving 17 and\nan old man providing 36 dinars bought for themselves mainte-\nnance during their remaining years.?® Naturally, only the barest\nnecessities were covered by such an arrangement.. Still, a young\nwidow or divorcée with such sums in hand had reasonable pros-\npects for a new venture in marriage, provided, of course, she\npossessed an outfit of her own. In general, the husband’s contribu-\ntion was not sufficient for guaranteeing his wife a decent living\nafter the termination of the marriage. For this she needed the\nadditional means provided by what she had brought with her from\nher father’s house.\n\nThe bride’s dowry.—\"Give your daughters to husbands,” says the\nProphet Jeremiah, 29:6. “Is the daughter in her father’s hands [so\nthat he can ‘give her away’]?” asks the Talmud (with reference to\nthe accepted opinion that a father should not marry off his\ndaughter as a minor, but should wait until she grows up and makes\nher own choice).”® Answer: “Have him give her something and\nprovide her with clothing and cover so that the young men will\njump [be eager] to marry her.”\n\nThis little disquisition illustrates the legal situation: the ketubba,\nthe husband’s obligation, was religious law; the nedunyd, an ancient\nNear Eastern term for the dowry, was a matter of practical wisdom\nand local custom.

Besides the Hebrew-Aramaic nedunya (“that which is\ngiven”), which appears in marriage coatracts and other legal\ndocuments throughout, and another Aramaic term,”’ mostly\nArabic words are used. Jahdz or jihaz, “outfit,” used also for\nequipping an army, fitting out a ship, or supplying a traveler with\nprovisions, is the term commonly found.** The word rak!, literally\n“luggage,” can designate the dowry in general, or the clothing and\nbedding, as opposed to the jewelry.*® Equally frequent is shuwdar\n(or shiwar), also originally denoting travel equipment, but assuming\nperhaps the specific meaning of trousseau because it was confused\nwith an almost identical word meaning beautiful clothing.®* A\nfourth Arabic term is of North African vintage, not surprising in\nview of the constant influx of Tunisian and Moroccan Jews into\nEgypt.”\n\nLists of trousseaux not included in marriage contracts are mostly\nheaded by the word taqwim, “estimate,” or “estimation,” already\nmet with above in connection with the engagement agreements.*\nThe procedure followed at the taqwim is evident from numerous\ndocuments.

The reverse\nside of one such list, which enumerated twelve items of gold and\nsilver jewelry, thirty-four of clothing, four of bedding, and thirteen\nof copper and other household goods, representing a total value of\n145 dinars, contains two statements: one of the father of the bride\n(named Sitt al-Su‘ada, “Mistress over the Happy Ones”) stating that\nall “gold, silver, copper, clothing, silk, and other valuables listed\noverleaf” had been given by him to his daughter as an irrevocable\ngift and were now her exclusive property, and one by the groom,\nthat he was obliged to keep all this as “iron sheep,” meaning\nsomething to be returned in full, for which he bore responsibility.\nAccording to the law there was no need for such declarations, for\nwhat they said was partly implied and partly expressed in the\nmarriage contract.

This declaration, too, was redundant and is, there-\nfore, absent from practically all similar lists, but, like the father’s\nadditions to the estimation, illustrates the actual procedures.*\n\nWhen did the tagqwim, the assessment of the trousseau, take\nplace? In the case of a well-to-do couple we have found that it had\nalready been done at the engagement, a full year before the\nwedding.®® When a raqwim document lists the early, but not the\nlate, marriage gift of the husband, it stands to reason that it too was\nwritten some time before the final preparations for the marriage.*\nFrom the wording of most relevant documents, however, the\nassessment of the trousseau seems to have taken place in connec-\ntion with the wedding, or, at least, the betrothal. One court record\nexpressly sets the date for the assessment two days before the\n“consecration,” which denotes either the “betrothal” or, rather, the\nbetrothal combined with the wedding.*' When the evaluation of a\ndowry was made on the evening of Sunday, September 2, 1244, two\ndays before the Day of Atonement, there can be little doubt that\nthe strange date was chosen because the wedding was scheduled\nfor the first possible day after that day of fasting, namely, the\nsubsequent Sunday, which preceded the Feast of Tabernacles by\none day. We remember that the eve of a holiday, and even more a\nday before that, were favorite dates for weddings of couples in\nmodest circumstances. This surmise is confirmed by the fact that\nthe next entry in that court record, written overleaf, was a wedding\nheld on the next Monday, the eve of the Feast of Tabernacles.*\n\nA properly executed and well-preserved appraisal of a dowry is\napt to provide us with a complete picture of the economic cir-\ncumstances of a marriage. It lists the price of each item and, where\nneeded, describes it by provenance, material, color, and size. The\ntotals of the main groups, such as gold and silver jewelry, clothing,\nbedding (including hangings and carpets), copper, and other\nhouschold goods, are often noted. The total of the entire outfit is\nfollowed by other possessions of the bride, such as houses, or,\nusually, parts of houses, one or more maidservants, and, occa-\nsionally, books. Finally, the document notes the contributions of\nthe groom and concludes with the grand total, that is, all that will\nbe due from him or his heirs at the termination of the marriage.*\n\nThe assessment lists were drafts to be entered into the final\nmarriage contracts and to be preserved in the record hooks or\n\nGoitein, S.

In both cases there was no reason to\ntear them up, as had to be done with the ketubba after it had served\nits purpose as proof for the obligations of the husband. Morecover,\nunlike the ketubba, a taqwim was usually written on both sides of a\nleaf. Thus, there was no inducement for people looking for paper\nto cut it according to their own needs. These technical circum-\nstances explain why the taqwim lists, second in number but not in\nimportance, to the marriage contracts themselves, represent a\nmost valuable source for our knowledge of the brides’ trousseaux.\n\nOf similar character and value, but limited in number, is another\ntype of document, named “dowry receipt.” In times of insecurity,\nor for other reasons, people occasionally found it advantageous not\nto include the specifications of the dowry in the marriage contract,\na document read out in public at the wedding. Instead, the groom\nacknowledged receipt of the dowry and of his obligation to pay the\ndelayed marriage gift in a separate document, explaining his doing\nso by his “apprehension of the vicissitudes of the time.” Such\nreceipts were written, for instance, in the years of the adminis-\ntration of “the Monk,” the Fatimid finance director notorious for\nhis rapacity (see Med. Soc., 11, 281, 348), during the transition from\nFatimid to Ayyubid rule, and in the middle of the thirteenth\ncentury, again a time of upheaval.**\n\nThe main repository of information on the bride’s dowry is, of\ncourse, the marriage contract, the ketubba. To make up for its\ngenerally poor state of preservation we are rewarded by the mass\nof detail it yields. The picture of the material civilization emerging\nfrom the Geniza is derived largely from ketubbas and cognate\ndocuments that describe the possessions of women, the furnishings\nof houses, and the implements of the kitchen, each with its price.\nHere, however, we encounter a serious difficulty. In many parts of\nthe Islamic world, including the countries in which the Geniza\npapers originated, it was customary to assign fictitious, highly\ninflated values to the outfit of the bride and to its individual iterns\nto enhance the prestige of the families concerned. Descriptions left\nus by medieval Arabic historians speaking of donkeys carrying\nempty boxes in the festive procession of the bride to her future\nhusband’s house, are tangible illustrations of this custom.** Nor was\nthis an innovation of Islam. The Talmud leaves it to the discretion\nof the parties involved whether to list in the ketubba the real values\nor to double the prices; and Saadya Gaon (d. 942), in his book of legal\nforms, partly preserved in the Geniza, reports that in some places\nthe former practice prevailed and in others, the latter.*\n\nGoitein, S.

Manasse around\n1130 it is expressly stated: “We evaluated each item doubling\nits price [“2 dinars being 1 dinar”], as is customary in our place.”\nConsequently, when slightly later, in 1145, a widow reclaimed her\ndowry and late marriage gift totaling 552 dinars, the court re-\nmarked: “This means that what is really due her amounts to\nsomething above 250 dinars.” A ketubba written at Saladin’s time\n(ca. 1190) contains this note: “The outfit can be reclaimed only at\nhalf the evaluation listed.”” These documents were issued in\nFustat. But outside the capital other customs were attested to. In a\ncourt record written on August 10, 1204, from Bilbays in the\ncastern part of the Nile Delta, it is stated that the wardrobe of the\nbride was appraised there as being worth four times its real value\nand her gold, silver, and copper two times as much. In the same\nperiod, in Alexandria, the entire outfit was priced at four times its\nworth. In the district capital al-Mahalla the situation was even\nworse: the prices were wildly exaggerated, but there was no fixed\ncustom in this matter.*®\n\nFortunately, in most cases we are able to get at the real prices.\nThe vast majority of marriage documents originated in the Egyptian\ncapital, and there we find that when the prices were doubled, a\nHebrew phrase “2 dinars are worth 1” was added to the trousseau\nlist. Such an addition is presupposed in the formulary of Halfon\nb. Manasse referred to in the preceding paragraph. In some cases it\nis stated explicitly that the husband’s responsibility is to be under-\nstood in this sense.** Conversely, numerous marriage documents,\nincluding many of the most detailed and valuable ones, say\nexpressly: “1 dinar is worth 1 dinar, real price, no duplication.”\nOne list, after providing the real values of the entire trousseau,\nadds: “The parties asked the sums to be doubled; consequently, the\ntotal will be such-and such.”®® Moreover, where documents sum up\nthe liabilities of the husband—marriage gift and dowry—in dinars\n“of full weight and worth, approved by an assayer,” it stands to\nreason that the real worth is intended. Wherever doubt remains,\nwe are able to check the items against those listed in documents\nexplicitly fixing the prices realistically, as well as by circumstantial\nevidence: the size and appearance of the document concerned, the\nnumber and type of the items listed, additional gifts of houses or\ntheir absence, conditions imposed on husband and wife, and so\nforth. But even lists suspect of blowing up their prices are not\nwithout value. First, it is interesting to know which objects they\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Clothing was expensive\nand was the husband’s main responsibility besides food. It was the\nwife’s chiel prerequisite and pride; occupation with her wardrobe\nwas her favorite pastime. Consequently, clothing was by far the\nlargest item in the bride’s outfit, a rule confirmed by only few\nexceptions.” The second largest group, also manufactured mainly\nfrom textiles, was formed by the furnishings, all those sofas and\nlounges with their cushions and reclining pillows, the mattresses\nwith their blankets and covers, curtains and other hangings, rugs,\nand carpets. One did not sit on a chair and at a table, we remember,\nbut on a sofa along the walls or simply on the floor. A house did not\nhave many rooms; curtains provided privacy; wall pictures, so\ncommon in Hellenistic and Roman civilizations, were next to\nabsent; beautiful hangings made the house friendly. In this bedding\ngroup the discrepancies among social classes and among individual\ncases were even more blatant than in clothing. It could occur that a\nrich bride brought in bedding valued over twice as much as her\nclothing or more than her clothing and jewelry taken together.*®\nMore uniformity is to be observed in the last group, copper\nutensils and other household goods, of which even otherwise rich\noutfits are often conspicuously poor.

More than a few brides possessed no ornaments at all.*\nObjects made of precious metals, as a rule, represented only about\none tenth or less of the total value of trousseaux estimated as being\nworth between 60 and 120 dinars.® But in the taqwims of rich girls\njewelry is regularly second in vaue only to clothing, and, in that of a\nvery rich girl, it comes first: worth 471 dinars, “real worth, no\nduplication,” as against 373 dinars for clothing.®” Although even\nwithin the opulent class the differences are great, they are still more\nmarked in the ketubbas of the lower middle class, where we find\njewelry worth 9 dinars in a total outfit of 203 dinars, as against one of\n53 dinars in one of 160 dinars, the latter being a ratio more com-\nmonly found with well-to-do girls.®\n\nThe perplexing story of the Geniza trousseau becomes mean-\ningful when we consider how it was brought together and how it\ncompares with the marriage gift of the husband. A look at the\nAppendix reveals that there was a tendency to fix a round sum as\nthe total value of the dowry. This shows that, as a rule, the bride’s\ndowry was not simply what she possessed but what had been agreed\nupon, probably after long pourparlers. In many cases, the indi-\nvidual sections, too, totaled round sums, which points in the same\ndirection. A distinct class stratification is evident in these totals,\nranging from the destitute who had no dowry at all,* to the rich\nwith 500 dinars and more, and the very rich who brought in 1,500\ndinars, plus maidservants and parts of houses.\n\nOccasionally we learn that a certain total was “local custom.”\nParticularly instructive is the following case. In a Hebrew doc-\nument written in Fustat on June 23, 982, the son-in-law agrees to\nstate in the marriage contract that he has received objects in gold,\nclothing, and furnishings worth 150 dinars, “as is customary in the\nketubbas of this city,” although what actually was brought in\namounted to only 50 dinars. Correspondingly, the father-in-law\ngave him 20 dinars in cash and a promissory note of 80 dinars,\nwhich had precedence over all his other obligations. This local\ncustom could not affect everyone, of course, since more than half\nthe brides of Fustat represented in the Geniza brought in 100\ndinars or less. Thus, a parent who belonged to a certain class had to\nsend off his daughter with an outfit worth not less than 150 dinars.\nIt is characteristic of the socioeconomic unity of the southern\n\nGoitein, S.

This restriction of the dowry to personal belongings\nof the bride was of vital social importance, as the next subsection\nshows.\n\nAn example illustrating how an outfit was acquired reveals\ncharacteristic aspects of that fateful step, no doubt one of the more\ndecisive factors in the economic life of Mediterranean society. Early\nin June, 1156, the grandmother and guardian of an orphan girl\nreceived from the merchant with whom the court had deposited\nthe orphan’s inheritance the considerable sum of 238 dinars in\norder to buy her the marriage outfit. In mid-August of the same\nyear she married with a dowry amounting, according to the almost\ncomplete list, to 723 dinars. The total was probably 750 dinars.\nThus the major part of the dowry must have come to her from her\nmother or even her grandmother, and this situation, as is presently\nexplained, probably was the rule rather than the exception. On the\nother hand, an agreement on the size of the dowry must have been\nmade in advance so that it was necessary to supplement it with the\ninheritance. Finally, a period of two months seems to be somewhat\nshort for the purchase of jewelry, clothing, and household goods\namounting to 238 dinars, considering that even in the trousseaux\nof wealthier brides items valued at 2 dinars or less were by no\nmeans rare. Thus the marriage booms of spring and autumn must\nhave created quite a stir in the bazaars.”’\n\nThe analysis of the husband’s marriage gift has revealed a high\ndegree of uniformity within each social class and also a fair\nmeasure of regularity in the relationship between the first install-\nment presented to the bride at the beginning of the marriage and\nthe delayed portion to be delivered when it was over. The case is\ndifferent with the relationship of both to the dowry.®\n\nWith few exceptions, the bride’s dowry amounted to five, ten,\ntwenty, thirty, and more times as much as the groom’s early\ninstallment, ten times as much, approximately, being the most\ncommon relationship.

But the matter is more complicated.\nTwo important aspects of the Geniza marriage emerge. The first is\ndemographic. The groom, as a rule, must have been considerably\nolder than the bride, for even the modest cash gift expected from\nhim at the wedding, together with the other expenses connected\nwith the marriage, required an effort of several years of work. But\nthe situation was entirely different from that of fourteenth-\ncentury Italy, made familiar to the student of medieval marriage by\nDavid Herlihy’s writings, where the demands on the bridegroom\nwere incomparably higher. This resulted in a far wider disparity in\nthe ages of the spouses with all the grave demographic, moral, and\ncultural consequences entailed. In the Geniza world, the lion’s\nshare in the initial economic makeup of a marriage was contributed\nby the bride’s family; consequently, the groom was not forced to\nspend too many years preparing his share.®®\n\nSecond, the wide differences in the relation between cash\nwedding gift and dowry found within the same stratum of eco-\nnomic capacity proves that money was not the sole, and in many\ncases not even the main, consideraton in the negotiation of a\nmarriage. It is even more conspicuous when the relationship\nbetween the delayed installment and the dowry is examined. When\nawidow or divorcée, possessing an outfit of 795 dinars—a sum large\nenough to maintain a family for thirty years—marries a man who\ngives her 5 at the wedding and promises 10 dinars at the ter-\nmination of the marriage, she must have had a special reason for\naccepting those terms. Her precise motivation, I leave to the\nimagination of the reader. But she certainly did not marry for\nmoney.” When a mother, assisted by her brother, gives her orphan\ndaughter, a virgin, to a husband presenting jewelry worth 10\ndinars at the wedding and promising a total marriage gift of not\nmore than 20, when the dowry is worth 774 dinars, very particular\ncircumstances must have influenced their choice.™ Since such\ndisparities are by no means uncommon, we must conclude that\n“imponderables” played a very great role in the arrangement of\nmarriages. In order to get an inkling of the motives that might\nhave been behind such decisions, I examine some of the family\npapers of persons known from the Geniza in other contexts. This\nwill give us the social backgrounds of the economic facts emerging\nfrom the ketubbas, lists of trousseaux, and cognate legal doc-\numents studied thus far. But before doing so, a topic usually\nforgotten, must be briefly considered: the economic role of the\nwife.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "132 Marriage viii, B, 4\n\nThe economic role of the wife—Seemingly, the wife is a recipient,\nnot a provider, of economic benefits: her husband makes her a\ngift at the beginning of the marriage and owes her a payment at its\ntermination, her family fits her out, and, in addition, she might\nreceive an inheritance, or a gift, or both, during her marriage.\n\nIn reality, the situation was different. In her marriage contract\nthe bride promised, among other things, to serve her husband. For\nthis service she was compensated by both her maintenance by the\nhusband and his obligatory gifts. Consequently, a wife was bound\nto work, “even if she had a hundred maidservants,” and the Jewish\ndoctors of law, who always tried to capture the realities of life in\nneat legal paragraphs, defined exactly which chores she was\nobliged to perform. The doctors were, however, reasonable\nenough to distinguish between work to be done by poorer women,\nsuch as grinding wheat, and those better-off, who sent their grain to\nthe miller or simply bought flour. Naturally, the economic value of\nthe wife’s work for her husband differed widely, ranging from\ndoing or supervising the household chores to substituting for him\nin his business affairs when he was ill, or teaching children when he\nneeded help.” According to age-old custom and statutory law\nspinning was one of the duties of a wife; it was still mentioned as\nsuch in a marriage document from the Fayyam, Egypt.”\n\nBesides “serving” her husband, the wife could earn by work done\n(at home or outside the house) for other people. The remarkable\namount and sophistication of Talmudic discussion devoted to the\nproblems of the wife’s earnings demonstrate the economic impor-\ntance which this source of family income had assumed in the\nimpoverished society of late antiquity.™ The very saying “he who\nexpects to maintain himself by the earnings (lit., wages) of his wife,\nwill never see blessing in his life,” betrays the extent of this\nphenomenon.”™ A wife’s earnings belonged to her husband in\ncompensation for the support provided by him, or, as the ancient\nformula has it, “her food against the work of her hands.”™\n\nAs far as the Geniza period is concerned, it seems that the\ninstances of working women were very rare during the tenth and\neleventh centuries. They became more common during the\ntwelfth, and are encountered with great frequency from the\nthirteenth onward. The first instance noted by me is a request\nsubmitted in Aramaic to the Nagid Mevorakh b. Saadya around\n1100 asking him to approve certain conditions to be included in a\nmarriage contract, the most conspicuous of them being “that he\nshould under no circumstances demand from his spouse her\nearnings, and, if she worked, they belonged to her” (see Med.

About thirty years later, but on the same sheet, such a\nrequest, reiterated in Arabic, and addressed to the Gaon Masliah,\nwas written by the court clerk, Halfén b. Manasse.” In a marriage\ncontract (in Aramaic, of course) by Halfon it is indeed stated that\nthe husband had no rights to his wife’s earnings—a divorcée—but\nthat she had to furnish her clothing with her work.” Even more\nsignificant are court proceedings recorded by Halfon, from which\nwe learn that a betrothal had broken down because of this question\nof the future wife’s work. The groom was dismayed that the place\nof her work was far away from his own living quarters; by the time\nof the agreement, however, he agreed, under oath, never to\ninterfere with her work or to take her earnings. Nothing is said\nabout clothing.”™ A few years later a document written by the judge\nNathan b. Samuel tells about a divorce caused by a dispute about\nthe wife’s work and a remarriage on condition that she provide her\nclothing with her earnings; the husband would be free from this\nobligation “whether she was employed or not.”® In 1157 Nathan’s\nson Mevérakh wrote a betrothal agreement, in which the bride,\nwho was the daughter of a cantor, received the right to keep her\ncarnings, while nothing was stipulated about clothing, which could\nonly mean that it had to be provided by the husband.® Finally, in a\npetition from Cairo to the Gaon Sar Shalom (ca. 1177—-1195), the\nwife of Abu ’l-Hasan, the miller, known as “Son of the Spindle\nMaker,” also the daughter of a cantor, requests that he should not\nhave the right to tell her, “go and do embroidery in the houses of\nother people and bring me your earnings,” and if she worked, she\nshould be permitted to retain her wages.*\n\nThis short survey has shown that the question of the wife’s rights\non her earnings occupied the Jewish courts throughout the twelfth\ncentury. When we consider, however, the mass of marriage doc-\numents extant from that century, we receive the impression that\nthis aspect of the wife's position was not yet a major issue. By the\nmiddle of the thirteenth century, however, working women must\nhave become so common that a statement on the wife’s earnings\nappears as a constant item in the marriage contracts. A ketubba\nwritten in 1260 by Judge Immanuel b. Yehiel contains the fixed\nformula “the work of her hands against her clothing” (it was the\nsecond marriage for both spouses and the bride undertook to\neducate her stepdaughters).** How far things had gone may be\ngauged from this statement in a ketubba written on September 11,\n1296 (Tishri 13): “She has taken upon herself that her earnings\nshould belong to her husband.” This was the law; there was no\nneed for such a declaration; but the opposite, namely that the wife\n\nGoitein, S.

At the end of this period, and probably under\nthe influence of immigrants to Egypt, it became customary to insert\ninto the marriage contracts the stipulation: “Her earnings belong to\nthe groom, and he is obliged to clothe her.” This return to statutary\nlaw was explicitly noted in contrast with the practice prevailing in the\ncountry before.®®\n\nNotice that the standing formula in Talmudic times was “her food\nagainst the work of her hands,” whereas throughout the Geniza\ndocuments it is the clothing that was to be provided by the wife if she\nwished to retain her earnings. This change may have been brought\nabout by the different socioeconomic ambiance. In Islamic times\nthe Jewish woman was more confined to her home, where she\noccupied herself with needlework and dyeing textiles, as well as\nwith exchanging items of her outfit for other materials needed for\nher wardrobe. Providing clothing for herself, both by home\nproduction and exchange, was therefore in comparatively easy\nreach. The Jewish woman of Late Antiquity was able to sustain\nherself and provide her own nourishment since she had wider\noptions for making a livelihood.

When this tendency becomes widespread from the\nmiddle of the thirteenth century on, one seems to be justified in\nassuming that this change reflects the increasing impoverishment\nand misery of the population in general and of a minority group in\nparticular. To be sure, one must also take into consideration that\nonce a formula has crept into legal documents, it has a tendency to\nperpetuate itself. On the other hand, the permit granted to brides\nwith large trousseaux to keep their earnings is not as preposterous\nas it appears at first sight.

Lane and Freiherr von Maltzan report from\nCairo and Jedda (the seaport of Mecca), respectively, that even the\nrichest Muslim women did not refrain from selling the products of\ntheir artistic needlework and even received orders.*!\n\nOne matter, though, appears, to be self-evident: a wife’s earnings\nby work could have been of substantial, even vital, value only in\nfamilies with small income, for a woman’s wages were minimal; in\nthe higher classes the wife’s economic power stemmed from her\nproperty. A wife’s possessions consisted of her dowry, or, rather, all\nthat she brought into marriage, her husband’s wedding gift, which\nbecame her personal property, and gifts and inheritances that she\nreceived during her married life. The legal rights on each of these\nitems are defined by law and are partly stated in the documents\nwritten at an engagement, betrothal, or wedding.

In the highly poetical\nintroduction to the betrothal document (in Hebrew, of course,\nsince the parties were Karaites) not only the father, but also the two\nuncles of the groom (known from other Geniza documents) are\nhighly culogized, which implied that the two families united by the\nnew bond were of equal status. The grandfather of Japheth-Hasan,\nSahl b. Israel b. Jacob, had emigrated—also accompanied by two\nbrothers—from southern Iran to Egypt. The proem of our doc-\nument alludes to this origin, and has God say to the emigrant: “Do\nnot be afraid of going down to Egypt, for there I shall make you a\ngreat people” (Genesis 46:3, said to the Patriarch Jacob). The bride\nbore the name of Amat al-*Aziz, “Maidservant of the Almighty,”\nnot found elsewhere in the Geniza. An aristocratic girl had to be\ndifferent.”\n\nAt approximately the same time, Husn (“Beauty,” a common\nname) b. Hayyim II, the granddaughter of another Karaite of\nPersian origin, the often mentioned and highly esteemed banker\nSahlawayh b. Hayyim I, received a marriage gift of 100 + 200 =\n300 dinars. The documents referring to the matches of the son\nand the daughter of Sahlawayh do not contain the relevant details.®\n\nIn 1080 the daughter of a government “treasurer” (gizbar in\nHeb., jahbadh in Ar., both derived from the Persian) was married,\nprobably in Tyre, to a man from Damascus with exactly the same\nmarriage gift.* These sums appear a fourth time two years later in\nthe ketubba of the nisi and temporary head of the Egyptian Jews,\nDavid b. Daniel b. Azarya, when he married a Karaite girl Geveret\n‘Alamoét (“Queen of the Girls,” a Heb. rendering of Ar. Sitt\nal-Banat) who brought in a dowry of almost 900 dinars.

Scholars in comfortable circumstances were\nthose who also were active in business or banking. We have the\nketubba from January 1050 of Abraham, the son of Isaac, the\nscholar, so often mentioned in this book.

Meshullam (Med. Soc., 11,\n513, sec. 20), and given by the scholarly nephew (who later became\na judge) of the India trader Abraham Yiji, when he married the\nlatter’s daughter.!®* All this tallies with statements in a book of\nMuslim legal opinions from Qayrawin to the effect that the\nmarriage gift of well-to-do ‘ulamd@ (Muslim religious scholars)\noscillated between 50, 100, and 120 dinars.!\n\nMerchants whose lucrative activities were not impeded by scholar-\nship or exertion for the common weal did better. An ‘aftar, or\n“perfumer,” marrying an orphan girl from an old family of India\ntraders produced 40 + 100 = 140 dinars as marriage gift and\nreceived 640 as dowry (November 1146). Shortly afterward, two\nother men undistinguished by public office or learning offered\n50 + 100 = 150 dinars and obtained even higher dowries. When\nthe prominent representative of the merchants in Fustat, Jekuthiel\nb. Moses, settled, after protracted litigation, with his divorcée for\n75 dinars we can be sure that the deferred marriage gift promised\nby him had been at least 100 dinars, if not much more.'®®\n\nThe marked differences found between groups within the upper\nand middle classes and illustrated by individual cases are also to be\nfound in the lower strata of the society. In Med. Soc., 11, 219—221,\nit has been pointed out that the cantors (comparable with the\nChristian lower clergy, or the Islamic smams, or leaders of the\ncongregation in prayer) formed a large and heterogeneous group of\nreligious and communal officials. This is evident also in the family\npapers of persons of this profession. David b. Shekhanya (the\nfather of Japheth, one of the most prolific scribes known from the\nGeniza) notes, in 1013 in a renewal of his lost marriage contract, a\ngift of 15 + 20 = 35 dinars and a dowry of over 100. But in\naddition to being a cantor, he served as court clerk and supervisor\nof two slaughterhouses, that is, he had a steady and assured\nincome.

        "text": "viii, B, 4 The Economic Foundations of Marriage 139\n\nThe two cantors whose daughters were expected to contribute to\nthe family income with their earnings, as described above, probably\nwere poor members of this profession.'®*\n\nSome general conclusions—The foundation of a nuclear family had\nformidable economic implications not common in our society. The\nhusband’s responsibilities and how he was able to meet them have\nbeen discussed above. A word must be added here on the wife’s\ndowry. A cursory reading of the Appendix brings home the fact\nthat in many cases the amounts represented by the bride’s outfit\ncould not have been raised by the efforts of the father alone. The\nhusband’s contributions and undertakings show what a man was\nable to save by his work. But the dowry was usually many times a\nmultiple of the husband’s wedding present and often also of his\ntotal marriage gift. This was possible because the jewelry, clothing,\nbedding, and copper brought in by the bride were largely heir-\nlooms passed down through generations. For this reason, many\ntrousseau lists contain specific items characterized as “new”; the\nmajority obviously were not.'® Most of the ketubbas in which the\nitem is extant stipulate that one-half of the outfit reverts to the\nwife’s family if she dies without offspring. Originally, being “the\ncustom of the sons of the Land of Israel” (see Med. Soc., 11, 6), this\nstipulation was accepted everywhere, although the law that ulti-\nmately prevailed in all Jewish communities was Babylonian-\nIragian, not Palestinian. The Karaites went a step further and\nruled that the entire outfit of the wife returns to her family if she\ndied childless. A stipulation to this effect is to be found in all\nrelevant Karaite documents from the Geniza seen by me. All this\ntaken together and combined with the material presented in this\nsubsection and the reports about the actual returning of dowries to\nwidows and divorcées (see C, 3, below), leads to a number of\nconclusions:\n\n1. The contribution of the extended family: Looking with\nreverence upon the preceding generations was not merely an act\nof piety; it had practical implications. The dead took care of the\nliving. A similar observation was evoked by the role of the pious\nfoundations providing the community with means for charity (see\nMed. Soc., 11, 121—122). The impact of past generations on the\nmaterial well being of their own posterity was even greater.\n\n2.

The birth of several daughters was an eco-\nnomic disaster, which explains why their arrival often was greeted\nwith mixed feelings. More about this in C, 2, and D, below.\n\n3. Stability of prices and durability of materials: It is astounding\nthat the bridegroom could take upon himself responsibility for\nrcturning the full value of the dowry after the termination of the\nmarriage, which normally would occur decades later. In the few\npassages of the Talmud dealing with the nedunyd it is assumed that\nthe prices of the individual items could change during the short\nperiod between the engagement and their actual purchase.'® The\nmonetary chaos of late antiquity is not unknown. By contrast,\nprices in the Geniza period tended to be remarkably stable.\nAlthough settlements leading to a reduction of the husband’s\nobligations are fairly common, the courts acted on the supposition\nthat he was obliged to pay the sums stated in the marriage\ncontract.’” Reductions were granted for a variety of reasons, but\nnever, as far as I can see, because of a change in the value of the\ncurrency. -\n\n\"The fact that demands were made for restitution of the outfit in\nkind, including items not only of gold or silver, but of copper and\ntextiles as well, and the common occurrence that mothers left such\nitems to their daughters point to the durability of the materials\nconcerned.'®\n\n4. Hoarding precious metals and textiles: Large quantities of\nprecious metals were thus taken out of circulation and hoarded in\nthe form of jewelry representing savings made for the protection\nof the so-called weaker sex. Since textiles served widely as types of\npayment, this consideration to a certain degree also applied to\nthem.\n\nIn addition, items of the outfit often served as collateral for debts\nincurred by the husband, or were used by him for commercial\nundertakings, and as such contributed to “the movement of the\nmarkets.” As far as the testimony of the Geniza goes, this occurred\nmostly in low-income families.'®®\n\n5. The bridal outfit a stimulus to arts and techniques: It has been\nemphasized above that during the classical Geniza period (tenth\nthrough thirteenth centuries) the dowry was always delivered in\nkind, never in cash.

This\nsocial habit must have had a tremendous influence on the devel-\nopment of gold-silver-and coppersmithing, as well as on the textile\nindustry in all its aspects, including dyeing (the production of\ndurable colors requiring much technical skill). Attractive and\ndurable goods had to be produced in large quantities. No wonder\nthat Islamic civilization excelled in the small arts, and that many\nJewish craftsmen worked in those industries.\n\n6. The wife’s possessions and her work, indicators of socio-\neconomic conditions and changes: The relative values of the\ndifferent sections and even items of the trousseaux varied widely\naccording to the social class to which a couple belonged. A study of\nthese differences is apt to reveal much about the daily life of the\nvarious classes of the population.\n\nThe fact that the economic importance of a wife’s earnings\nincreased steadily from the twelfth century on seems to point to the\nmounting impoverishment of the Jewish community or the pop-\nulation in general, perhaps also to a slight change in the attitude\ntoward women.\n\n7.

The imponderables referred to in the preceding para-\ngraph softened the boundarics between the categories.\n\n10. Muslim and Christian parallels: Islamic and Judaic marriage\nlaws and legal forms differed considerably. The Jewish represen-\ntative delegated by the bride to receive the minimal obligatory\nmarriage gift, whose appointment is not mandatory, is essentially\ndifferent from the Muslim male guardian of the female, without\nwhom no marriage can be contracted. Also, the “debt,” or ketubba,\npayable by a Jewish husband at the termination of the marriage\nshould not be equated with the Muslim deferred mahr, payable at a\nstipulated time after the wedding according to evidence in Muslim\nmarriage contracts contemporary with the Geniza documents.\nFinally, it is highly significant that a trousseau list or its total value\n(sometimes also subtotals of its sections) is included in the Jewish\nbut not in the Muslim marriage contracts. This inclusion empha-\nsizes the property rights of the wife to whom the dowry reverts at\nthe termination of the marriage.\n\nA minority speaking the language of the surrounding majority is\nnaturally likely to adapt its legal nomenclature and procedures to\ntheirs, as has been observed. There remains the question of how\naccurately the Geniza material is able to illustrate social conditions\nprevailing in the population at large. Instructive parallels have\nbeen noted: a customary local dowry valued at 150 dinars, the\nmaximum amount of 500 dinars for both Jewish and Muslim\ndowries found thus far, and the similarity in the amounts of the\nmarriage gifts presented by the divines of both religions. To them\nshould be added the marriage gift of a Coptic deacon to the\ndaughter of a Coptic priest in Aswan amounting to 15 + 75 = 90\ndinars. These parallels are noted here simply as prelude.

But since this consisted mostly in jewelry, female clothing,\nand kitchenware, it was she who had constant control of these\nvaluables: items could easily disappear through sale or otherwise,\nwhile the husband stood security for the dowry’s full worth. Third,\nif not otherwise stipulated, the wife’s earnings by work went into\nthe common pool, which meant, for all practical purposes, that\nthey belonged to her husband. Since these earnings were mostly\nderived from needlework, spinning, or weaving, or from serving as\na sales woman to other women, it was difficult for her husband to\nknow her actual takes, and suspicion might raise its ugly head.\nFinally, at the termination of the marriage, when considerable\npayments were due the wife, counterclaims, such as that she had\nreceived loans, partial payments of the late marriage gift, or partial\nor full disposition of her dowry, could be made. The stipulation,\nsummarized under the Hebrew term “trustworthiness,” aimed at\nthe protection of the married woman from such and similar\nallegations and, thus, at the preservation of marital peace.\n\nThis stipulation was formulated in different ways, and, conse-\nquently, had different scopes: “She is trustworthy in her state-\nments, in the management of the house, with regard to her outfit\nand ,all other implements used by her in every respect and against\nany claimant, [in particular] her husband and all his heirs after his\ndeath; she has the status of two trustworthy witnesses whose\ntestimony is accepted in court; no oath may be imposed on her\nunder any circumstances, not even a ban in general terms.”\nAlthough the document from which this passage is taken was\nmerely a betrothal agreement, the stipulation was provided in full,\nbecause the bride was a girl from Fustat married to a husband in a\nprovincial town and, consequently, in particular need of pro-\ntection.” The same full text of the stipulation was provided by the\nsame clerk, Halfon b.

By chance, the com-\nmunal record of her marriage has been preserved; it details her\nmarriage gift and dowry, but says nothing about trustworthiness.*?\nFinally, the many deathbed declarations in which a husband grants,\nor reconfirms, the status of incontestable trustworthiness to his wife\nprove how precarious this privilege was.'*\n\nA short comment is required concerning another formulation of\nthe item “trustworthiness” found in a number of marriage agree-\nments. It runs like this: “She is to be held trustworthy by her\nhusband during his lifetime and his heirs after his death with\nregard to all food and drink prepared in the house and any claim\nfounded on surmise [and not on proof]. No oath might be imposed\non her etc.” When I read this first in the engagement contract of\nthe daughter of a well-to-do India trader, which granted her\nspecial privileges, among them exclusive rights to the immobile\nproperty she owned, I surmised that the formulation was intended\nto further strengthen her position. In reality this different version\nis a matter of legal definition based on the socioeconomic realities\nof late antiquity. The item “claim founded on surmise [and not on\nproof]”, Heb. fa‘anat shemmd, is based on Mishna Ketubbot 9:4:\n“He who has his wife keep a store or appoints her as manager of his\naffairs may impose on her an oath at any time [even without having\na proof against her],” and Shevu‘ot 7:8: “These must give an oath,\nalthough no claim based on a proof is made against them:\npartners, sharecroppers, managers, and wives doing business for\ntheir husbands.” The wife as shopkeeper is a figure familiar from\nthe East European Jewish shtetl, as it was in Talmudic times, but\ndoes not fit into the Islamic society of the Geniza period. Since this\nright of the husband was enshrined in the law books, however,\nsome judges regarded it as necessary to protect the wife against it.**\n\nThe condition of the wife’s trustworthiness, so prominent in the\nGeniza marriage agreements, is not paralleled in the relevant\ndocuments of the Islamic environment. A stipulation that a wife is\nto be believed when she claims that her husband has maltreated her\nis found in Cordova, Spain, around 900.'

The situation\nwas different with regard to the next common stipulation in the\nGeniza marriage agreements—that referring to the wife’s possible\nrivals.\n\nNo second wife, no maidservant without the wife’s approval, no\nconcubine.—Ancient Jewish, like Islamic, law permitted polygyny.\nUnlike Islam, Judaism, as practiced in the Geniza period, strictly\nprohibited sexual relations between a master and a slave girl owned\nby him, which, of course, was also the law of the Church. Since the\nsocial customs of a surrounding majority are apt to be accepted by a\nminority, the prohibition of marrying another wife, included in a\nGeniza marriage contract, was regularly accompanied by the\nprovision that the husband should not keep a maidservant disliked\nby his wife or should not acquire any without her approval. There\neven exist marriage agreements that contain the clause concerning\nthe slave girl but not that against polygyny, which seems to\ndemonstrate that the latter was less a threat to a wife than the\nformer.\"”\n\nAn examination of the oldest testimony for the polygyny—slave\ngirl clause known thus far confirms this impression. After four\nspecific conditions, including one that 1 have not yet found\nelsewhere (“If she makes something, it belongs to her”), the text\ncontinues: “[He undertakes] not to buy any maidservant except\nwith his wife’s consent, and whenever she will demand to have her\nremoved from the house [i.e., to sell her], he will do so; also, not to\ntake another wife, and if he does, he will pay her the delayed\ninstallment [of the marriage gift] in its totality and write her a\ndocument that will set her free from him, although she [and not\nhe] demands the separation.” No wonder that the clause regarding\nthe slave girl came first.

For there is a great difference between such a stray\nitem and a fixed legal form appearing in numerous documents and\nreferred to as “the well-known conditions.” Friedman also draws\nattention to the story of the Sicilian Jew who was married in\nDamascus but was obliged to have a wife in the Egyptian capital if\nhe wished to enter government service (as related in Med. Soc., 1,\n68). The rabbinical court of Fustat informed the applicant that,\naccording to local custom, he could not take 2 second wife without the\nconsent of the first or his repudiation of her.*\" The early existence\nof this custom is attested by another document written during the\nyears 989—1089.** Complaints or reports about polygyny are\nalmost completely absent from the documents of the Geniza of the\neleventh century, although the majority of the material, at least the\nletters, originated at that time. A petition by a woman whose\nhusband had taken a second wife, “whose tears never dried,” and\nwho asked for “a strong document” safeguarding her rights, was\nwritten early in the wwelfth century.®® Thus that local custom\nprobably had been in force for many years. Special circumstances\nmust have caused its formulation into a stereotyped condition to be\ninserted in a marriage agreement.\n\nI assume that the change came about at the time and probably on\nthe initiative of the Nagid Mevorakh b. Saadya (ca. 1095—1112),\nwhose vigorous communal and religious leadership replaced that\nof the Jerusalem yeshiva (see Med. Soc., 11, 30). The oldest\nformulation of the slave girl—polygyny clause translated above was\nwritten when he was in office. It was executed calligraphically and\non a separate sheet, no doubt in order to be submitted to the Nagid\nfor approval.** Its insertion into a marriage agreement could be\nonly a recommendation, not legally binding, and it is character-\nistic of the history of legal usage that the final, or, at least, the most\ncommon form of the clause—with polygyny mentioned first—\nappears only under the authority of Mevérakh’s son, the Nagid\nMoses.”®\n\nWhat did the monogyny clause give to the wife? First, the hus-\nband had to pay her (or to deposit in court) her delayed marriage\ngift. This was, of course, a most effective deterrent, inasmuch as\nthe sum stipulated could be saved by most husbands only in the\ncourse of many years.

It seems, however, that this applied only in\nthe case of mixed marriages between Rabbanites and Karaites.?® As\nFriedman has rightly emphasized, the acceptance of the late\nmarriage gift by the wife did not necessarily imply that she\ndemanded a divorce. The choice was hers. This is the plain mean-\ning of the regular monogyny clause, and some documents say\nexplicitly: “He will pay her the delayed marriage gift in full. If she\nwillingly consents to remain married to him together with that\nother wife, she may do so. If not, he is obligated to write for her the\nbill of release by which she will be set free.”*” But would any wife\nagree, out of her free will, to share her husband with another\nwoman? To the many observations made with regard to this aspect\nof polygyny I should like to add one of my own. While studying the\nsociety of a Yemenite weavers’ village, which, in 1950, was trans-\nferred almost intact from Yemen to the hills of Judea, 1 was\nastounded to find two women, widows of one man, living together\nfor no other reason than that they were good friends. The first wife\nhad been barren, the second was the mother of several children.\nThe latter described their married life to me thus: “We two women\nwere like two doves. The man was one week with her and the next\nwith me. 1 did embroidery, and she the household work. I\nproduced the children, and she reared them.” When the woman\nfelt that I may have misunderstood or misheard her, she added:\n“Very simple, she loves children and I love to do needlework.”?®\n\nIn general, however, the right of the husband to take additional\nwives was a curse, and it is therefore no surprise that even in the\nancient Near East fathers made provisions protecting their daugh-\nters from this calamity (Genesis 31:50).2° Islamic law and custom\nfound various ways to empower the first wife to rule over the\nsecond or to obtain a divorce either for the second wife or for her-\nself (the husband transferring his right of repudiation to his first\nwife).** A few actual marriage contracts from the ninth century\nbearing these conditions have been preserved on Egyptian papyri,\nwhile collections of responsa by Muslim jurisconsults in Cordova,\nSpain, refer to that clause at approximately the same time.® It\nstands to reason that the countries between Spain and Egypt\nfollowed a similar course; the clause in question is indeed known as\nthe Qayrawanese condition (named so after Qayrawin, then the\ncapital of the country known today as Tunisia). It must be con-\nceded, however, that none of the published Egyptian marriage\ncontracts contemporary with the Geniza documents bearing the\npolygyny—slave girl clause contains a similar stipulation.

Our report on\nmarital life in the light of the Geniza documents (C, 1, below) shows\nthat it was a minor social evil.

That situation is foreseen when a groom imposes on\nhis bride “never to separate him from his mother.”** More com-\nmon was a rider to the contrary, namely, that the arrangement was\nvalid only so long as it was not harmful to the young wife, or,\nmore precisely defined: the husband had to move out of his par-\nents’ house if she wished so, or to divorce her if he refused her\ndemand.®\n\nThe situation with regard to domiciles provided by the wife’s\nparents was more complicated. In many instances the wife brought\nin one or several houses (more frequently: shares in houses) either\nas part of her outfit or as her personal property, the income from\nwhich was hers to the exclusion of her husband.

In\none such marriage contract, written in Tyre, Lebanon, the father\nhad given his daughter a house in Acre, to be occupied by the\nyoung couple. But the father retained the right to live in that\nhouse, too, temporarily or permanently, either alone, or with his\nwife and children, if he happened to return to Acre, where he had\nbeen domiciled before.*” Similarly, in a Muslim marriage agree-\nment the father stipulated that the couple stay in his house until his\ndaughter got accustomed to her husband.*\n\nMostly, however, one has the impression that the condition\nobligating the newly married couple to live with the wife’s parents\nwas made for the benefit of the parents, probably because they had\nno one else to look after them. This is never said so expressly. The\ndocuments simply say: “Living quarters with her parents.”* But\nwhen we read as the very first condition in a rather detailed mar-\nriage agreement, “she will never cease to live with her mother and\nnever part from her; even if the girl, God forbid, should desire\nthis, she will not be supported in this demand,” it is obvious in\nwhose favor this stipulation was made.*® Also, when a girl brings\ninto the marriage half a house on condition that her mother lives\nwith her, we may assume that the widow had no other accommoda-\ntion.*! In rhany cases, however, the young couple stayed in the\nhouse of the wife’s parents simply because the husband, as the\nbridegroom in Tripoli quoted above, had no house of his own.**\nThen the question arose whether he had to pay rent, as he would\nhave done if he had lived elsewhere. It must have been a widely\naccepted Muslim custom that a son-in-law living with the parents of\nhis wife did not pay rent.* This explains why the second example\nof a social-conditions agreement summarized above emphasized so\nstrongly that the husband who had to pay his in-laws a rent of 6\ndinars a year, that is, half a dinar per month, was expected to pay\npunctually, without any delay or argument.* Two marriage docu-\nments, one Karaite and one Rabbanite, two centuries apart, contain\nthe stipulation that the husband living in a house belonging to his\nwife was not bound to pay her rent. The second document adds,\nhowever, that if the husband preferred to live elsewhere, he had no\nrights whatsoever on the house and the wife might make use of the\nrent as she saw fit.**\n\nThe condition most frequently imposed on a husband concern-\ning his residence was the prohibition to settle with his wife any-\nwhere except in the town agreed upon.

Only two and a half miles or less separated the twin\ncities, but they were so different in character that they could be\nregarded as remote despite the geographical proximity.*® Other\ndocuments prohibit (or give the right) to move from Cairo.*” When\na bride followed her husband to a provincial town, or vice versa,\nher or his obligation to do so had to be stated explicitly in the\nengagement or betrothal document.*®\n\nSince the choice of the domicile was one of the main causes of\nmarital friction, it became customary from the end of the twelfth\ncentury onward to insert a clause in the marriage document stating\nwhether he or she had the right to choose. This stipulation was\nformulated in different ways. “He will settle her in a place which\nshe will select” seems to mean that the wife selects the apartment,\nbut he has the final word.*® Such wording obfuscated the matter, as\nis proved by our first example of social-safeguards documents,\nwhere the future husband’s prerogative had to be reiterated at the\nend.”® The opposite formulation, where the wife’s consent is\nrequired, also lacks precision.* Finally, 2 common form of this\nclause became the blunt statement: “The choice of the domicile is\nin the hand of the groom” (or “the bride”), sometimes fortified by\nthe addition “wherever he likes.” Even when the bride follows the\ngroom to his hometown, she might be given the prerogative of the\nchoice of the domicile.”® Muslim marriage customs also foresaw\nstipulations granting or denying the husband the right to move to\nanother city, or authorizing the wife to demand that she should not\nshare living quarters with her husband’s parents.®\n\nThe question of the couple’s residence was largely one of the\nrelationship between the two families to which each partner\nbelonged. Mostly, tensions and discord between the families be-\ncame apparent only during married life and, therefore, were rarely\nreferred to in the marriage agreements. A Muslim marriage con-\ntract from the year 878 stipulates “he will not prevent her from\nvisiting her family, nor her family from visiting her”—obviously a\nstereotyped clause, only exceptionally echoed in Geniza marriage\ndocuments. A native of Alexandria, who followed his wife to the\ncapital, got her consent to visit his family in the Mediterranean port\ntogether with him once a year. Both parties were divorcées. The\nagreement was necessary. Clearly such agreements were occa-\nsioned by special circumstances since we find others where the wife\nwas exempted from the obligation to visit the husband’s family.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

M. A. Friedman has made a comprehensive\nstudy of this aspect of married life in Geniza times.>* After carefully\nexamining the situation in pre-Islamic times, he arrives at the con-\nclusion that both in practice and in theory, the Jewish family had to\nadapt itself—to be sure, only to a certain degree—to the stern rules\nof seclusion prevailing in the Muslim environment. Maimonides in\nhis Code, first states, in accordance with Jewish law, that the wife\nhas the right to leave the house and go to her father’s residence,\nto gatherings of mourning or festivities, to be attentive to her\nfemale [riends and relatives, so that they may also come and visit\nher; for, Maimonides adds, she is not a prisoner to be prevented\nfrom going and coming. The latter remark seems to be an allusion\nto a passage in Muhammad’s famous “sermon of farewell,” pro-\nnounced at his last pilgrimage to Mecca, where, in introducing his\nreforms in favor of women, he said: “Your wives are like prisoners\nof war; they have no free disposition over themselves.”* The same\nallusion is found in a circular of Maimonides’ contemporary and\nadversary, the Gaon Samuel b. Eli of Baghdad.*” But after having\nstated the wife’s rights, Maimonides adds—apparently without\nbeing authorized to do so by a Talmudic precedent—that the\nhusband may not permit his wife to leave the house more than once\nor twice during a month, “for there is nothing more beautiful for a\nwife than sitting in the corner of her house, as it is written (Psalm\n45:14): “The most honored place for a princess is inside.” \"**\n\nAl-Ghazali, the great teacher of Islamic ethics, deals with this\ntopic repeatedly, and, specifically in his chapter on jealousy, which,\naccording to him, is both a vice and a virtue. A wife may leave the\nhouse with permission of her husband, but staying (he says: sitting)\nat home “is safer.” “For leaving the house merely for sightseeing\nand other unimportant matters is detrimental to [the husband’s]\nmuruwwa, ‘manliness,” and may lead to immorality [on her side].”>®\nScreening one’s wife from the outside world was a matter of pride\nfor her husband. Such an attitude was present in Greece and in the\nJewish society known from Talmudic literature. Probably under\nIranian influence it became far more pronounced in the Islamic\nworld.

When “Sitt al-Ahl\n[“Mistress of the Family”], the virgin bride, promises to behave with\ndeference toward her father-in-law Samuel, the father of the\ngroom, never to treat him with disrespect, to listen to his com-\nmands, and to accept his moral guidance,” we must have a closer\nlook at her ketubba in order to find out what might have necessi-\ntated the clause. Her own father was dead, thus she was probably\naccustomed to a higher degree of independence than other girls.\nOld Samuel was a synagogue singer, perhaps a comical figure, not\naverse to the bottle, as was not unusual among the members of that\nvocation or avocation (see Med. Soc., 11, 223—224). Thus, a stipula-\ntion on deference to him was not out of place. On the reverse side\nof her ketubba we read that, seven yecars after the wedding, the\nhusband had hastily pronounced an oath to repudiate her but\nregretted it immediately; since oaths had to be honored, a writ of\ndivorce was written, delivered to her, and immediately torn up,\nwhereupon a new marriage ceremony with all its accouterments\nwas held. All this shows that the persons with whom “Mistress of\nthe Family” became connected were of a somewhat peculiar\ncharacter.”™\n\nA clause not to utter a hasty oath harmful to one’s wife is indeed\nincluded in a marriage contract. Other instances where thoughtless\nswearing led to compulsory repudiation are reported in the\nGeniza. 1 see here the influence of the Muslim environment where\nswearing to divorce one’s wife was a common form of confirming\nany assertion and where even such an oath pronounced in drunk-\nenness made repudiation obligatory.™\n\nTwo marriage documents, almost a century apart, onc in elo-\nquent Hebrew, the other in plain Arabic, presented here in\nabbreviated translations, scem to indicate that members of the\njeunesse dorée of the Egyptian capital sometimes needed a warn-\ning that entrance into the marital state demanded a change in their\nstyle of life.

The wedding was deferred for two full years.\nThe first special clause states that the groom cannot make any con-\ndition or demand with regard to the outfit to be provided by the\nbride’s father. Then the text goes on: “He also took upon himself\nto walk in praiseworthy ways and not to make friends with people\nwhose company is obnoxious. Whenever any revolting behavior on\nhis side is established, he must deliver 10 dinars to the girl [his\nfuture wife] as a personal gift.” Finally, her father had the right to\nbreak off the engagement whenever he deemed fit.

During most of the classical Geniza period Egypt\nwas ruled by a Shi‘ite caliph while the majority of the population\nremained Sunni Muslim, and in North Africa the Shi‘ites became,\nin the course of the eleventh century, a cruelly persecuted minor-\nity. There was another Muslim sectin North Africa at that time, the\nIbadi branch of the Kharijites, which was small, but vigorous, and\nhas remained so until the present day. And there were other\nsplinter groups. Mixed marriages between orthodox Muslims and\nothers, regarded as schismatic, occupied the divines frequently,\nand their rulings varied from toleration or recommendation of\nconversion to outright prohibition.” The Coptic Church demands\nfrom members of other Eastern churches, or Latin Catholics, the\nacceptance of the Coptic faith at marriage (and, in our days, from\nProtestants, even renewed baptism).®®\n\nIn view of this situation the rich Geniza material on Rabbanite-\nKaraite mixed marriages gains significance. It ranges from mar-\nriage agreements devoted almost entirely to the religious obser-\nvances of the two contracting partners to others where no mention\nis made of religion at all and where the fact of intermarriage is\nrecognizable only by the distribution of a stipulated fine between\nthe poor of the Karaites and Rabbanites. This topic is treated in\nvolume IV, chapter X. No case of intermarriage with a Samaritan is\nknown to me from the Geniza, although, in Mamluk times, the\nhead of the Jewish community had jurisdiction also over that small\nschismatic group.*\n\nSquabbles over marriage agreements—Considering the many eco-\nnomic and social safeguards that had to be taken into consideration\nat the conclusion of a marriage we are not surprised that the\nTalmudic saying “no ketubba without squabbles” finds its con-\nfirmation in the state of numerous Geniza documents. When we\nfind a beautifully written ketubba with the sum of the delayed mar-\nriage gift entered in another, irregular and ugly script, it is evident\nthat the item concerned was an object of contention until the very\nlast moment.** In another ketubba that entry is left blank alto-\n\nGoitein, S.

There the wish was that she should\n“enter her house,” or “come into a blessed and auspicious home.”**\n“Making the bride happy” was of course a religious obligation no\nless than that statutory requirement with regard to the groom. The\ngood wishes and quotations written at the head and in the margins\nof the marriage contracts state this emphatically. The Talmud tells\nquite astonishing stories about how great divines tried to fulfill this\ncommandment, one even taking the bride on his shoulders and\ndancing with her.*® In the Islamic ambiance female merrymakers\nhad to do the job. But the difference in the good wishes for boys\nand girls reflects a reality. Marriage for the husband was a change:\ntogether with the acquisition of a source of possible happiness, he\ntook upon himself “a yoke,” but essentially he remained within the\nsame male society to which he had belonged before. For the wife it\nwas a shock; she became uprooted and was thrown into a strange\nenvironment with entirely new functions, physical and otherwise.\nWe must keep this difference in mind while turning now to the\nstudy of married life as revealed in the Geniza records.\n\nGoitein, S.

Husband and Wife\n\n“Baby” and “Mistress of the house.”—Can we ever hope to\npenetrate the arcanum of married life in an age and region so\nremoved from us as the High Middle Ages in Egypt and other\ncountries of the Mediterranean area? The Cairo Geniza, the tool of\nenquiry used in this book, provides us with letters and documents.\nDocuments such as contracts, declarations, pleas, and court records\nreveal to us the realities of life and are invaluable. But normally\none goes to court or makes out a written settlement only when\nmutual trust has become weakened or when things have gotten out\nof hand altogether. Consequently, the testimony of documents is\nslanted; it is unable to tell us the whole story.\n\nWe are even worse off with letters. The postulates of propriety,\nas understood in those parts and days, put stringent limitations on\nthe freedom of expression of letter writers. A man was at liberty to\naddress his mother or sister as he liked, but not his wife. We possess\nonly a few examples of personal letters sent by a husband to his\nwife, meant for her eyes (and not to be read out to her by a man).\nThree such letters are translated in full at the end of this subsection\nto enable the reader to listen to a medieval couple exchanging their\nthoughts and feelings when they were, so to say, unobserved. An\nallusion to intimate relations has been found by me only once, ina\nletter which is remarkable also for several other reasons, but which\nwas never sent off. While reading it through again, the writer must\nhave decided that it was not dignified to commit such matters to\npaper. !\n\nAs a rule, when a man was away from home, he wrote not to his\nwife but to his mother or a male relative, referring to his wife most\nsparingly, if at all—for instance, inquiring after her health, making\narrangements for her maintenance, or simply sending her regards.\nUnder no circumstances would he call her “my wife”; that ex-\npression would carry too improper a sexual connotation. He would\nsend greetings to his children “and their mother,” or would refer\nto her as “the house,” “the residence,” “the inhabitants of the\nhouse,” or use other awkward expressions. In Hebrew, where the\nword “inhabitants” is rendered not by a singular collective term, as\nin Arabic ahl, but by a plural, ba‘alée ha-bayut, “masters of the house,”\nthe prudish circumlocution sounds particularly strange to us.?\n\nDuring most of the “classical” Geniza period, when writing 1o a\nrelative, even to a son or a brother, one would not refer to the\n\nGoitein, S.

Even a husband writing home could say\n“greet my uncle [meaning his father-in-law] and the one who is\nwith me,” meaning his wife; she was then actually far away from\nhim.® The name of a man’s wife was never mentioned. Strict Jewish\netiquette prohibited sending greetings to any woman, and, as can\nbe seen from the correspondence of scholarly merchants of the\ncleventh century, this taboo was then taken very seriously. Thus it\nhappened that we have over two hundred and fifty letters ad-\ndressed to, or written by, Nahray b. Nissim, many from close\n‘relatives and intimate friends, yet we never learn the name of his\nwife—and he had three, two whom he mourned, and one who\nsurvived him.* In the warm, personal letter of the judge Labrat I\nb. Moses I of al-Mahdiyya, to his younger brother, of which a\npassage is translated above, he expresses regret that he has never\nmet his brother’s “house,” who had just borne him a boy. But\nhe sends regards to his brother’s father- and brothers-in-law,\nand even to the newborn, but not to his brother’s wife. Only “the\ngirl,” meaning the judge’s wife, sends greetings to her brother-\nand sister-in-law.®\n\nHappily we are able to observe in the Geniza a gradual erosion of\nthis rigid taboo. In many letters we do find regards to the\nrecipient’s “house,” or to “the one who is with him,” or to the\nmother of his children. In this respect the concluding passage of\nMoses Maimonides’ long letter to his beloved disciple Joseph b.\nJudah is particularly noteworthy. After having stated that even the\nmaidservants in the house pray for him and wish to see him back,\nMaimonides adds: “Although the religious law forbids to send\ngreetings to a woman, it does not forbid to pray for her, therefore\n‘Peace upon you and peace upon your house’ (I Samuel 25:6),”\nmeaning the disciple’s wife.® Exactly the same words are found at the\nend of a Geniza letter, addressed to a judge, and the quotation\nfrom I Samuel often stands for regards destined for a woman.”\n\nBut there is more to it. Beginning with the later half of the\ntwelfth and especially in the thirteenth and later centuries women\nare freely mentioned by name and greeted, and not rarely the\nnames of a whole bevy of women appear in one letter. One no\nlonger needed 1o beat about the bush, but could speak freely about\n“your wife” and “my wife,”® and messages by and to women\nbecome frequent. This change cannot be attributed to the weak-\nening of religious discipline, for the Late Middle Ages were char-\nacterized by strictness and bigotry rather than by laxity. Nor can it\n\nGoitein, S.

When the father of a\nnewlywed girl writes to his son-in-law, “I have only one request, be\nconsiderate with your maidservant [meaning, the writer’s\ndaughter], for, you know, she has no one in the world except you\n[being a stranger in your town],” he emphasizes the wife’s sub-\nservient role: jariya, “maidservant,” was then the term commonly in\nuse for “slave girl.”*®\n\nThis attitude toward the young wife had its root and justification\nin plain facts: normally she was a teenager with no experience in\nlife. Even after a wife had borne three living children, her husband,\non his deathbed, appointed not her, but her mother (his mother-\nin-law), as sole guardian of her children and executrix of his will; as\nthe document explicitly says, the dying man relied on the old\nwoman’s efficiency (besides her piety and her love for her grand-\nchildren)j; clearly, he could not expect such knowledge of the world\nfrom his wife, who perhaps had not yet reached the age of twenty\nat that time. Additional examples of such situations could easily be\nadduced.\"? .\n\nOn the Sabbath of the wedding week the groom was honored in\nthe synagogue with the recitation of the beautiful story of Rebekah\n(the future wife of the Patriarch Isaac), who, when asked by a\ntraveler to let him have a little sip of water from her jug, not only\nlet him have his fill, but ran back and forth to the well, until she had\ndrawn water for all the ten camels forming the traveler’s caravan.\nPoems in honor of the groom referring to this custom have been\npreserved in the Geniza.\" The ideal young wife was the one who\ndid her chores with enthusiasm merely because of her good\ncharacter (and probably also her good education), and we have no\nreason to doubt that there were many like Rebekah, “found perfect\nin the house of her father-in-law and running home all the time,\nreporting her success to the house of her father.”** Yet the “baby”-\ncomplex has its pitfalls. A teenager certainly needs guidance;\nbut adolescence is also the age when the young woman feels herself\nbecoming ever stronger, physically and mentally, and, conse-\nquently, less and less inclined to bow to the authority of her\nhusband or his family.

I am referring to “house,” repeatedly\nmentioned above.?* “I entered my house” means “I married.”!\nHowever prolonged a husband’s absence from his home might have\nbeen—and sometimes he absented himself for years—his “house”\nwas the place where his wife resided. This was the attitude of the\ngovernment, the Jewish authorities, and the population at large.*\nIn the life of many couples the Hebrew maxim “ ‘his house’ means\nhis wife” took on quite a literal connotation, namely, that the\nnewlyweds moved away from the groom’s family into separate\nliving quarters. This important aspect of married life is discussed\nbelow.*\n\nA third group of terms describes the wife as “the mistress of the\nhouse,” and this is to be taken literally. When the young wife\nmoved into the house of her parents-in-law, or even when she\nremained in her own father’s house, she became a subordinate\nrather than a mistress: “You have made her a servant”, writes an\nuncle, who was dissatisfied with the treatment of his niece by her\nhusband’s mother, who put her to work despite the young woman’s\nconnections to her aunt by various other family ties.** A father\nwriting to his son-in-law (who shared living quarters with him)\nwould call his own wife “lady of the house,” but his daughter “the\none who is with you,” and a father addressing his married children\nwould express himsell similarly.*® This was natural, since a mother\nwas addressed and referred to as “my mistress.” When, however,\nthe years went by, and, especially after the death of the husband’s\nfather, the mother-in-law herself would refer to the wife as the\nmistress of the house, and a son writing to his mother would send\nregards to his wife using the same epithet.*® Naturally, everything\ndepended on the circumstances and the personalities involved.\nFrom “baby” to “mistress of the house” was a long way, and it was\nan uphill struggle. Some never made it. In not a few Geniza papers\nwomen of old age appear as oppressed and miserable as they\nprobably had been in their youth.

But it is perhaps worthwhile to inquire how these matters\nwere felt and expressed in a society so different from ours.\n\nThere is no need to emphasize that the nature of love prevailing\nin those days and its rhythm of growth were diametrically opposed\nto those we consider ideal. For us love is a bond between equals, not\nmuch different in essence from true friendship between persons of\nthe same sex; subsequent intimate relations may enhance or\ndiminish feelings previously entertained. Couples in Geniza times\nhad little, if any, opportunity for premarital friendship, although\nseclusion, as shown above, was by no means complete.® As a rule,\nmarriage was the beginning, not the crowning, of an alliance. And\nit was an alliance definitely not between equals, but between a\nmaster and one commended to his care. When mutual satisfaction\nprevailed and, in the struggle of life, the wife became more and\nmore her husband’s support, marriage grew into companionship,\ninto a bond between equals, or, rather, nearly equals. When Geniza\nhusbands speak of love, we should take them seriously. They were\nnot people from another planet.\n\nOnce again taking our clue from the Rebekah story, recited on\nthe wedding Sabbath, we read in Genesis 24:67: “He [Isaac] took\nRebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and thus found solace\nafter his mother’s death.” The verse indicates more than a sequence,\nnamely that love comes with marriage and does not precede it:\nreplacing the mother, the wife becomes the mature companion of\nher husband. A wish to this effect expressed in a Geniza letter is\ncited above.™ When a schoolmaster living far away from home\napprises his old mother of his marriage and writes that he was\nabsolutely happy and that his young wife, besides being beautiful,\nhad all the good and noble character traits of his mother, we feel\nthat his innermost desires had been satisfied, and also that “love at\nfirst sight” was not entirely out of reach of medieval people.\nNormally, the relationship as expected at the beginning of a\nmarriage was as expressed in this plea of a father-in-law: “I need\nnot commend to you the one who is with you; treat her, as 1 know\nyou will, with kindness, tenderness, and consideration.”® But in the\n\nGoitein, S.

Nissim: “May God make her an individual\nblessing, khassiyya mubaraka, for you and give you success with each\nother.” The term khdssiyya designates something possessing a\nspecific nature or having been specifically prepared. They under-\nstood, as we do, that happiness in marriage depended on the\nconcord of the personalities of husband and wife.®\n\nWhat did a Geniza man seek in his wife? The usual Hebrew\nlaudatory epithets—woman of valor, pious, virtuous, and chaste, as\nthey were understood in those days—are apt to convey a fairly\ncorrect idea. First, a young wife should be a Rebekah, doing\nwillingly and effectively the work expected from her, or, as we read\nin one letter: “I was happy to learn that your wife is efficient, clean,\nsolid, and doing her chores well.”* The term “pious,” saddeqet,\ncomprised the additional nuances of charitable, lenient, con-\nsiderate (with everyone, especially, of course, her husband, some-\nthing similar to the considerateness stipulated in the Karaite\nketubba).*” “Virtuous,” keshérd, referred to sex and religious\nobservances in general. “Chaste,” senii‘d, should perhaps be best\ntranslated as “unassuming,” “knowing her place,” also “one who\nknows to keep a secret.” The beauty of a wife could be mentioned\nsolely in a personal letter addressed by a son to his mother, and\neven that was exceptional.®® Flattery of the bride’s beauty in\nwedding songs consisted of stereotyped phrases and was mean-\ningless. ‘The most specific reference to a married woman's looks a\npoet could permit himself is one found in an encomium for the\nhead of a yeshiva.

Since\nthe husband did not give his wife household money, but did the\nshopping himself, the Geniza women were not in the fortunate\nposition of our grandmothers who deftly saved here and there\nfrom their weekly allocations and then surprised everyone in the\nhouse with the wonderful things they bought with them.

Since they were stipulated as a duty in the marriage contract,\nthe frequency of marital relations that could be regarded as a\nsufficient fulfillment of that obligation was discussed by the sages of\nthe Talmud. They were reasonable enough to posit a wide range of\nalternatives according to the occupations of the husbands and\nsimilar circumstances. They agreed, however, that for scholars\nonce a week was enough and that the proper time for the\nfulfillment of this duty was the night belonging to, that is, pre-\nceding, the weekly day of rest. Since everyone regarded himself as\na student of the holy law, this measure became standard. An India\ntrader, away from home for years, writes to his impatient wife: “1\ndo not believe that the heart of anyone traveling away from his wife\nhas remained like mine, all the time and all the years—from the\nmoment of our separation to the very hour of writing this\nletter—so constantly thinking of you and yearning after you and\nregretting to be unable to provide you with what [ so much desire:\nyour legal rights on every Sabbath and holiday. . . .”*\" The lonely\nhusband whose letter is translated at the end of this subsection felt\nparticularly miserable on Friday nights.

Of a woman temporarily separated from her husband\nit was said: “She has no holiday and no Sabbath.”3?\n\nSimilar customs prevailed in Islam and Christendom. Thursday\nnight, which precedes the Islamic weekly holiday, was set aside for\nconjugal enjoyment, to be followed by a bath and perfuming on\nFriday morning—before the solemn noon prayer which was to be\nattended by all males. In Christian Europe, in social classes\nadhering to traditional ways, Saturday| night had a similar role. The\nstatutory three monthly visits to their wives incumbent on Athenian\nhusbands in classical times imply a similar frequency of connubial\nrelations. These customs, spread over such wide areas of time and\nspace may at the outset have had their origins in hygienic as-\nsumptions, which later, in monotheistic societies, were surrounded\nwith a religious halo.?\n\nThe Karaites regarded sexual activity on the Sabbath as a grave\ndesecration of the holiness of the day.

It corresponds exactly to “Son of the\nMule,” another such byname found in the Geniza.’\n\nPrescriptions for satisfactory intercourse and amulets against\nwitchcraft or the evil eye impeding it are not absent from the\nGeniza. How serious magical interfering with sexual performance\nwas taken is evident from an official petition by the teacher and\ncourt clerk Solomon b.

That a wife should be like 2 man’s mother is, of\ncourse, a human propensity also found elsewhere.\n\n1 want a girl just like the girl\nThat married dear old dad,\n\nsays an old American song. But in the generation-bound Geniza\nsociety this attitude was particularly strong.®® The most common\nactual complaints of a wife were that the mother-in-law was not\nconsiderate, did not honor her, imposed on her too much work,\nand suspiciously supervised her comings and goings. Astoundingly\nfor us, but in complete conformity with the notions of the Geniza\nworld, the relationship with the sister-in-law was even more com-\nplicated. The special attachment of brothers to sisters is discussed\nin detail in subsection A, 2, above. To this we must add that the\nonly females of approximately the same age with whom a young\nbachelor could talk intimately were his sisters; no wonder, then,\nthat, after marriage, he still would find their company more\ncongenial than that of his new wife, especially when the sisters were\nolder and more mature, as appears to have happened in the light\nof various reports. It seems, too, that the newlywed had not rarely\nto live under one roof with spinsters, an additional aggravating\ncircumstance. All this explains the young wife’s sufferings and her\nendeavor to move away from her husband’s family.\n\nSuch situations were foreseen in many engagement, betrothal,\nand marriage contracts.”” Even more do we hear about them in\ncomplaints and settlements made in the course of married life. An\nexample from a well-to-do and educated family may open our\nsurvey. The young husband is described as a scholar. On the wite’s\nside an uncle conducted the pourparlers, even though her father\nwas still alive, perhaps because it was regarded as more dignified.\nAt the marriage of Sitt al-Nasab (“Lady of Noble Birth”) it was\nstipulated that she had the right to coerce her husband to move\nwith her to another place, if she did not get along well with his\nsisters (and his mother; in one phrase the mother is mentioned in\nthe second place, and in another she is omitted, suggesting that the\ndifficulties were with the sisters).

In addition, the extra rent\nwas a burden. Therefore, at the intervention of Sitt al-Nasab’s\nuncle, a new agreement was reached, which is characteristic in\nvarious respects: Sitt al-Nasab returned on condition, (a) that she\nwould live in a separate apartment, which was on a different floor\nand looking out on the inner court, while the family of her\nhusband would occupy the part of the house facing the street; (b)\nthat none of his sisters should enter her place, not even to ask fora\nmatch:™ (¢) that the preparation of food and all other household\nactivities should be separate; (d) that her husband’s living quarters\nshould be separate from those of his sisters; (¢) that in case of new\ntrouble the husband had to move out with his wife to another\nhouse; (f) that in case of nonfulfillment of any of these conditions\nher husband would pay without any delay a fine of 50 dinars—an\nenormous sum—to be distributed to the poor of Fustat.™\n\nA quite different atmosphere prevails in another settlement\nwritten by the same scribe, the frequently mentioned Halfon b.\nManasse. Here the husband undertakes to prevent his mother,\nsister, or any other relatives of his from entering his wife’s\npremises, or from harassing or harming her. He on his side will not\n“stretch out his hand against her,” nor run away, nor hide himself\nas if he was a runaway. She on her side will not leave the house\nexcept with his permission, and, in general, the spouses will behave\nproperly toward each other; otherwise, the court will intervene.\nHere the harassing of the wife by the female members of the\nhusband’s had almost led to the breakup of his marriage.”™\n\nA third marriage settlement written by Halfon b. Manasse,\nunfortunately preserved only in part, reveals a new aspect of family\nrelations. Again the sisters of the husband are denied access to the\nwife’s living quarters except with her permission, and he himself is\nwarned never to curse or to beat her. Here, however, the wife’s\nmother had intervened, had given part of a house to the young\ncouple on condition that her daughter should share the apartment\nwith her, should be free to leave the house whenever she liked, and\nshould have exclusive rights to her earnings. The old woman also\nstipulated a number of items for her own benefit.”\n\nA fourth, and even more fragmentary, agreement made out by\nHalfon b.

But the husband insisted that his own furniture should not be\nmoved “to the new house”; only his wife’s outfit should go with her\non condition that he was no longer responsible for it. As in our first\nexample, it was regarded as entirely feasible for the husband to\nremain in the house or apartment of his own family, while his wife\noccupied a place by herself. I assume “the new house” adjoined one\nof the existing houses of one of the two families.™\n\nA frightening picture of the suffering of a young wife is revealed\nin this complaint to a judge: the husband (known as a pauper from\na communal list) maltreats and curses “the little one.” Things had\nreached these extremes: his sister hits her with her shoe (or is it her\nfoot?), his father calls her names, whenever he sees her, and, in\ngeneral, “she has no esteem or home with them.” In order to\ntorment her, the husband threatens to marry another wife, and\n“every day he drives her out of the house.” On top of all this, he\nspreads rumors about her and gives her a bad name. They even\nbrought the midwife to examine her, but, “thank God,” she found\nher to be pure.”\n\nThis epitome of marital strife, caused or aggravated by the\ninterference of the husband’s family, is fittingly concluded by a cry\nfor help uttered by the luckless woman. It is the story of a family\ninterconnected by two, and very probably, three marriages with\npaternal first cousins. The writer’s mother-in-law was a sister of the\naddressee and was married to her cousin. The writer's mother had\na bad reputation, which she had probably acquired after the death\nof her husband, a brother of the young woman’s father-in-law. 1\nhave little doubt that this mother of hers was another sister of the\nuncle; for otherwise one can hardly understand why she expected\nto find in him support against closer relatives. From the tone of her\nletter and its repeated statement “1 still have a claim on you,” 1\nconclude that her uncle had taken her into his house and brought\nher up after the adventures of his sister, her mother. We can even\ngo a step further and imagine that the dashing widow was more\nsuccessful as a woman, than her sister, the unhappy girl’s aunt and\nmother-in-law. This would go a long way to explain that “inter-\nminable enmity” of which the letter speaks. The writer calls herself\nUmm Sitt al-Nas, “Mother of ‘the Mistress of Mankind’”; she\nmight once have had a little girl by that name.

        "text": "viii, C, 1 Husband and Wife 177\n\nThe reader who has attentively followed the story of Ibn Sabra’s\nniece, as told above, may wonder why two of his sisters had\nfollowed him from Tunisia to Egypt when his wife had remained in\nher native city. It was not exceptional. Moses Maimonides, when\nleaving Morocco or Spain for the East, was accompanied by at least\ntwo sisters, and another prominent Westerner going East, Nahray\nb. Nissim, traveled with his sister. Brothers were trusted more than\nhusbands.®\n\nExamples of wives refusing to follow their husbands to a foreign\ncountry are numerous, a few already having been mentioned. Arye\nb. Judah, probably a European Jew, as his name indicates, had\nmarried a woman in Cairo and wished to take her with him to\nPalermo, Sicily, which, at that time (January 1095) was under\nNorman domination. The young couple had visited there, but, once\nback in Cairo the young wife took refuge in her father’s house and\nrefused to return. Arye swore that he could not live in Cairo and\nfinally arranged with her father to repudiate her. He returned her\noutfit, and she restored the early installment of the marriage gift,\nas was the duty of a wife who declined to follow her husband “to his\nhouse,” as the document states.®® A Tunisian who had married a\nwoman in Constantinople, but was imprisoned there and suffered\nother hardships, “which two camel loads of paper would be unable\nto describe,” had to divorce her before leaving the counury,\nalthough she had borne him a boy, who had died, and a girl, who was\nstill small. The reason: he intended to leave Byzantium for good.\n“May God never let me see the Land of the Ram again,” he writes\nfrom Jerusalem.*® A girl from ‘Ibillin, a village in western Galilee\n(still in existence), who was married in al-Mahalla, Egypt, to a man\nfrom Aleppo, Syria, wrote an urgent message to her mother in the\ncapital, asking her to come quickly or to dispatch a proxy: her\nhusband wished to take her to his native city, which she was by no\nmeans prepared to do.”’\n\nFollowing a husband to another place in the same country was no\nless shunned, and for a variety of reasons. We already know that\nstipulations regulating this aspect of marriage were often included\nin engagement contracts and ketubbas. Here some cases that\npopped up during married life are considered. It was not always\nthe pressure of the wife’s family which counted. There was the\nyoung wife who was an inveterate city dweller and was not\nprepared to move with her husband to a small place out in the\nprovinces, or could not endure remaining there. In one such\ninstance her uncle, who had arranged the marriage because he was\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Her husband\nretorted that Fustat was too expensive; the most he could cope with\nwas Damietta, the Mediterranean port.®\n\nThen there were also women who were reluctant to go from\ncountry to city. In the first of the three letters translated at the end\nof this subsection, the wife, a daughter of the dayyan, or Jewish\njudge, of al-Mahalla, refuses to follow her husband to the capital.\nAt home she was a queen; in Fustat, a girl from the countryside. In\na similar situation a woman from the Rif writes to her husband,\nwho had tarried in the capital too long (and had not written her):\n“You fancy that I will come to Misr. I shall never go up there. For if\nI do so, weé shall not live in peace with each other—may God never\nplant discord between us.”® But even inducing a wife to follow her\nhusband from one provincial town to another required action by\nthe authorities.”” A summons to a woman asks her to appear in\ncourt and to explain why she refused to accompany her husband\n(where to is not stated). As we have seen, it was her duty to do so if\nprovisions to the contrary had not been made in her marriage\ncontract.”\n\nThe Geniza material presented thus far shows the wife relying\non her family for protection against her husband. Naturally, the\nbattle lines were not always drawn up that way. Often the wife had\nreason to complain about her own kin, especially when they were\ntardy in making good the promises made in the marriage agree-\nments. A lovely little letter from the countryside complains about\nthe people back home who had not yet delivered “the textiles and\nthe copper” listed in the ketubba, so that the newlywed girl had to\nserve the meals to her husband in earthenware, which caused her\nno end of embarrassment.** A more serious situation is revealed in\nan ancient court record where the wife declares that her father had\nappropriated her outfit, for which reason she frees her husband\nfrom any responsibility for it.** In a magnificently written Hebrew\nfragment a woman called Esther (probably a foreigner, since\nEgyptian Jewesses did not bear biblical names) appoints her\nhusband as her proxy for suing her brother who had not delivered\nwhat he had promised in her betrothal contract.” Other cases\nabout nonfulfillment of economic stipulations in favor of the bride\nare extant and some of them are described below.

Male relatives or friends sub-\nstituted for the master of the house in his absence; the monthly\nallocations of money and wheat were standardized, and usually\nmodest.”® Current expenses such as purchases and payments for\nrepairs, were usually made or supervised by him or by his male\nrepresentatives. This created a high degree of dependence of the\nwife, but was not necessarily always regarded as such: the husband\nwas the errand boy of the wife. In a public appeal to the community\na woman’s first complaint was that her old husband vexed her by\nsending her out of the house to do for him this or that*\nAssurances of a husband that he will be “the obedient slave” in the\nhouse and she “the mistress and queen” are not absent from Geniza\nletters.'® Does not a widely diffused Arabic proverb advise the\nnewlywed: “Be a slave to your husband for a week, and he will be\nyour slave all his life”? Yet, the husband was the breadwinner and\nsupporter. This was his duty, but also the source of his power. It\nwas the general order of things and, therefore, probably was felt as\nless oppressive than it is to us.\n\nThe economic power of the husbhand also encompassed the wife’s\ndowry, since he had the right of usufruct (using the income from\nthe wife’s property). But this power was limited by the obligation—\nextended to his heirs—to restore every dinar of it in case of a\ndivorce or his death. In fact, the dowry represented a strong bond\nbetween the spouses and gave them a constant opportunity for\ncooperation. The bride’s extensive wardrobe, bedding, furnish-\nings, and kitchenware spared the young couple from incurring\nlarge expenses at the start of their married life. Part of the jewelry,\nusually comprising a number, and often a considerable number, of\nornaments of the same type, could be, and was, used as collateral\nfor her husband’s mercantile undertakings. And her houses, or\nshares in houses, when included in the dowry, brought rent,\nsupplementing the family budget. Any use of the wife’s jewelry\nrequired her cooperation. It cannot be stressed enough that during\nthe classical Geniza period the dowry did not consist of cash given\nto the husband, but of the wife’s objects, thus emphasizing that it\nwas her property, not his. Add to this the fact that the dowry was\nusually a multiple of the marriage gift—immediate and delayed—\nprovided by the husband, and it becomes evident, that the middle-\nclass dowry and other possessions of the wife made her position\nquite comfortable.!”\n\nGoitein, S.

Explicit statements to this effect are extant.'”\nThroughout the centuries we read about a wife granting aloan ora\ngift to her husband, selling to or buying from him, standing\nsecurity for him, or vice versa, or engaged in other transactions—\nall situations showing her as disposing of a purse of her own. A few\nexamples on loans illustrate. The first example does not credit\nmuch the male partner, Sitt al-Dar (“Lady of the House”) had given\na loan of 10 dinars (in the presence of two witnesses, of course) to\nher husband, whose family name was “Son of the Trustworthy,”\nal- Adl. After an initial denial he admitted that the sum had been\ngiven to him—10 gold pieces in number, 9 in weight—but only in\norder to enable him to pay her the delayed marriage gift in case she\nrequested him to repudiate her.

As is only\nhuman, the misbehavior often was mutual; and there even existed\na term to describe it, mughabara fi 'l-rabl, “trying to outdo one\nanother in grabbing the other’s possessions.” A document using\nthis term describes a typical solution for such marital strife: (a) the\nhusband promises to return all the belongings that he had removed\nfrom the house;'” (b) all the furnishings, carpets, jewelry, and\ncopper that the wife had deposited with her mother or with any\nother members of her family will be taken off the list of her\npossessions for which the husband was responsible; (¢) in the future\nshe will dispose of such items only with his consent and in the\npresence of two witnesses; (d) he will dispose of her things or his\nown belongings only with her consent and in the presence of two\nwitnesses.

The husband brought her to court in\nFustat, “and asked her many questions.” It then appeared that only\n10 of the 20% dinars were mortgaged to her ketubba, whereupon\nshe empowered her husband to sue her brother for the remaining\n10% dinars and for the profit made with that sum.\"'®\n\nThe sad story of a physician, told in a long letter of his to an old\nuncle, concludes this chapter of marital distress.

She “ate up” all he had brought with him, to the\namount of 150 dinars. He asked for a divorce, of course, without\npaying her dues, and received a legal opinion confirming his rights\nfrom no less an authority than Moses Maimonides. But it is a long\nway from a legal opinion to its implementation by a court. Our\nphysician left the place and for two years tried to establish himself\nin another town. Meanwhile the wife had borne and weaned a girl,\nand the family induced him to join her again. On court order all his\nbelongings were returned and his little boy, who had been sent to\nhis dead mother’s family, was brought back. Soon, however, the old\nstory began again.

They served as a warning to the husband that he\ncould be forced by court action to divorce his wife (and to pay her\nthe late installment of the marriage gift) if a suit of this nature was\nbrought against him. Thus the frequency of such references in\nlegal documents does not necessarily reflect a similar frequency\nof occurrences in life. Wife-beating is very rarely mentioned in\nletters.'”\" Yet, the testimony of the documents cannot be easily\ndismissed.\n\nRabbis writing in medieval France and Germany were very\noutspoken on wife-beating, branding it an un-Jewish practice. The\nfamous Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, Germany, went as far as to\nrecommend cutting off the hand of a husband who habitually\ncommitted this crime, since hitting a woman was a graver sin than\ninjuring a man.

The Koran\n(5:33) permits, or perhaps recommends, beating the wife if she is\ninaccessible to milder forms of correction. It must be noted,\nhowever, that the Muslim courts protected her against an exces-\nsively cruel husband. Readers of The Arabian Nights may remember\nthe beautiful story of the good-natured cobbler Mawraf, whose\nshrew of a wife is forever running to the qadi, falsely accusing\nMa‘raf of beating her, whereas, in reality, he was the meekest and\ngentlest of husbands. And Ibn Battiita the great traveler, himself\nrepeatedly holding the office of a judge, describes how a colleague\nprotected a woman with a similar complaint.\n\nSince the holy book of the ruling faith had acquiesced to\nwife-beating, however, an atmosphere was created, which may\nhave induced some Jewish authorities in Islamic lands to take a\nsimilar view. Yehuday Gaon, the first reputed author of a post-\nTalmudic code of law (eighth century), writes: “A wife should never\nraise her voice against her husband, but should remain silent even\nif he beats her—as chaste women do.” Even Maimonides wrote in\nhis Code: “A woman who refuses to do the work to which she is\nobliged may be forced to do so, even with the stick.” To this his\nProvencal critic, R. Abraham b. David, remarks: “I have never\nheard that it is permitted to correct women with a stick.” “I have\nnever heard” means: there is no legal support in the sources for\nMaimonides’ ruling. The Talmud, indeed, says nothing of the\nkind, and in the numerous Geniza records, in which women bring\ncomplaints before the courts in this matter, the latter invariably\nreprimand the husbands, occasionally imposing fines on those who\nrelapsed.'??\n\nSurveying the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish literary sources\nknown to me I am not convinced that wife-beating was more\nrampant in Mediterranean Islamic countries than in medieval\nWestern Europe, nor that the legal situation was much different. If\nthe Geniza material produced below gives a different impression, it\nshould be noted that it mostly concerns couples from the lower and\nlowest strata of society. Poverty breeds discord, easily erupting into\nviolence. Maimonides is a special case: coming from the Muslim\nWest with its stern mores, he was dismayed by the easygoing\nmanners of Fatimid Egypt, and since “idleness leads to lewdness”\n(repeatedly quoted by him), he took a particularly hard stance—\nunwarranted by the law—with regard to a woman who refuses to\ndo her household chores (which were mandatory).\n\nGoitein, S.

The husband had to stay at\nhome two weeks, the period left free by the Jewish laws of purity for\nintimate relations during a month. He was not permitted to absent\nhimself for more than a month, during which he had to pay his wife\nher expenses every week. Failing to do so, he had to deliver to her\nthe final marriage gift immediately and in full. She promised “to\nattend to her house and her work and not to go out.” In case of\ncontravention she faced divorce.\"®\n\nWhen the husband traveled overseas it was also customary to seta\nlimit to the time he could absent himself. [n July (Tammuz) 1045 a\nnative of Barga (Benghazi, Libya) appeared with his wife before a\nnotary in Fustat and received permission from her to be away until\nthe forthcoming Passover (April). Moreover, he empowered the\nnotary to write a bill of divorce and to deliver it to her in case he did\nnot return in time.**\" This instrument of precaution, used by both\nMuslim and Jewish courts, has already been referred to more than\nonce.\"* [t seems that even at the beginning of the twelfth century, a\nstatute was in force in the Jewish community of Fustat which made\nsuch an arrangement obligatory.\"* How it worked, may be learned\nfrom this passage in the letter of a trader who had suffered\nshipwreck, got stuck in Sicily, and was prevented from returning to\nEgypt by a state of war in the Mediterranean:\n\nIf she accepts the divorce, I shall send every vear the alimony for the boy.\nBut if she prefers not to accept it, deal with this matter discreetly in a way\ndeserving my thanks: ask her whether she is prepared to settle with me in\nSicily. [In case she does], let her confirm this by oath and inform me\naccordingly. I shall then sell my place and bring her here together with my\nboy. By God, I did not write her the bill of divorce because I hated her, but\nbecause I was afraid of the punishment of the Creator [that is, a violent\ndeath).\"**\n\nIn many instances it was not practicable to fix a term for the\nhusband’s absence, particularly when the husband moved to an-\nother place to try to establish himself there and left his wife and\nchildren back in the family home until he was sure of the success of\nhis new venture. That must have happened frequently, for we often\nfind situations where a husband lives in one town and his family in\nanother, to be visited by him from time to time.

To these economic stipulations were added\nsocial safeguards. The wife was given exclusive use of the upper\nfloor of the house, which she had occupied with her husband and his\nparents, and “her father-in-law and his wife” had to move down-\nstairs to the middle story and were not to intrude on her. She would\nget someone to stay with her and to serve her. The husband’s\nparents were not to interfere with visitors calling on her and, when\nspeaking of her parents, were always to mention them with the\nblessing due the dead [such as “may he rest in Eden”]. This\nagreement was to be in force “even for a hundred years” until the\nhusband asked her in writing to join him in his new domicile or came\nin person to fetch her. Since a fragment of the marriage contract\nof that woman has been found in the Geniza, it is likely that\nher husband fulfilled his promise and brought her, indeed, to\nEgypl‘LAS\n\nThe exchange rate of local issues was extremely unstable and its\nequivalent therefore had to be fixed in gold. The strange sum of\none-sixth of a dinar plus one-half of a qirat as payment for one week,\nif multiplied by four, results in three quarters of a dinar, a monthly\nalimony found elsewhere in settlements made with absentee hus-\nbands, in one case, together with 3 waybas of wheat.'*®\n\nIn the agreements made between lower class spouses, the wife’s\ncarnings were an important factor.

For her part, she pledged to pay, out of these 20 dirhems, his\npoll tax, the rent for their apartment, and her household expenses. She\nwould not claim anything from him in addition to this, after he had paid\nher that sum through the court; nor would he lay any claim to her earnings\nfrom work or spinning, not even as much as a penny.

The wife found she could not manage and\nincurred a debt, and, in addition, claimed that the rent was hers.'*®\n\nTo avoid ambiguities, an India trader seiting out for Yemen states\nexplicitly that the income derived by his wife from a house was hers,\nsince he had sold it to her. The agreement shows how well-to-do\npeople arranged their affairs. The wife received for herself, her two\ndaughters (still small children), and a maidservant 25 dinars per\nyear plus 5 irdabbs of wheat (equivalent of 30 waybas, or about 120\ngallons). This tallies with the 30 dinars per year and 12 irdabbs of\nwheat assigned to another woman (with a small boy) of the same\nclass.'® In addition, however, the wife of the India trader received\nher late marriage gift, which amounted to 60 dinars (actually she got\nonly 55 with 5 remaining as a debt against the husband), and her\ndowry, which was evaluated at 400 dinars or more (the tens and\nsingle digits are lost). Naturally, 2 new marriage contract had to be\ndrawn up. The only date on the incompletely preserved document is\nthat of the original ketubba, summer 1157, butanother document, a\nconditional bill of repudiation, given by the same husband to the\nsame wife before setting out on a journey in summer 1169 (and\nwritten by the same scribe), probably coincided in time with the\nfinancial arrangements just discussed.

How this\nwas realized is illustrated in my Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders, pp.\n249-251, and in messages of travelers specifying the items sent and\nhow to use them.'s* Many times, however, their hopes were not\nrealized. The letters in which husbands excuse themselves for\ntarrying longer than planned, or for sending only part of the\nallocations promised, or nothing at all, are legion. Unemployment,\nmishaps, danger on the roads, or failure of the friends back home to\nlive up to their promises were the usual reasons given. “I have not\nleft a thing for the children,” observes a merchant abroad ruefully,\nasking a business friend to look after his family.'** When Mevéorakh\nb. Nathan, the scribe so often mentioned in this book, came home\nfrom a journey, he found the house stripped of everything, “not\neven a mouse could find something to eat,” because the friend who\nhad undertaken to provide the family with wheat had himself gone\non travel and forgotten to pass on his task to someone else.'*® A\nhusband away in North Africa assures his wife that he has not\nforgotten her and vows not to wash his clothes, to cut his hair, to\ndrink wine, or to enter a bathhouse before seeing her.”*” Another\ntraveler tarrying away from home pledges to fast during daytime\nuntil he gets back.'*® Such vows, [ am afraid, did not fill empty\nstomachs.\n\nHow the family at home managed is well illustrated in the letter\ntranslated below, written by a boy, proficient in Hebrew and Arabic\nscripts (sons of merchants were taught both), as dictated to him, no\ndoubt, by his mother. The recipient, ‘Allan b. Hasstan, an India\ntrader known from other Geniza records, had traveled to North\nAfrica and had sent money home, but, for reasons not specified, it\nwas not delivered to the family.

The writer gets\nvery excited. “I should neglect my wife?!” he exclaims, adding: “Has\nnot God said [Proverbs 11:17]: ‘He who wrongs his flesh [meaning:\nwife, Genesis 2:23] is a cruel one?!” and, quoting Proverbs 22:23, he\ninvokes God to punish those who give him a bad reputation.’®* One\ntraveler even asserted that his wife had been given too much and\ntold the addressee, a close relative, that he would sue him for the\nbalance.'®\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "viii, G, 1 Husband and Wife 195\n\nThe runaway husband.—An orderly absence, carefully prepared by\nnotarial agreements written before departure and made bearable by\ncorrespondence while away on travel, differed substantially from\nthose innumerable instances where the husband vanished, leaving\nthe family without sufficient support, or no support at all, and\nwithout knowledge of his whereabouts and doings. Such disap-\npearances occurred when the husband was unable or unwilling to\nmaintain his family, or defaulted in paying his debts to private\ncreditors or the tax collector, or both, or fled for personal reasons,\nsuch as a danger forcing him to go underground, conflicts with his\nwife, or, simply, “because he found someone”—usually a slave\ngirl—“more beautiful than her.”\n\n“Your brother quarrels with his wife. He went on a journey, and\nno one knows whereto he traveled.” The casual way in which this\ntragedy is reported (in a letter sent, in Sept. 1212, by a learned\ncantor in Alexandria to an even more eminent colleague in Fustat)\nshows how common such occurrences must have been. When such\nsituations arose, the authorities intervened, trying to find the\nfugitive, bring him to court, induce him to return to his family, or, at\nleast, to send those at home what was due them. Failing all this, a\ncourt would force him, by threat of excommunication, to write his\nwife a bill of repudiation, thus redeeming her from an intolerable\nbond. But usually this was a very protracted affair: until the wife and\nher family made up their minds to publicize their troubles by suing\nthe culprit; until the authorities acted; until trustworthy and\nconcerned travelers were found, who were prepared to carry the\nmessages to the relevant localities; until the courts approached took\naction; and finally, until the husband put into effect what he had\nbeen induced or forced to do.

But the times were catastrophic. Palestine was\noverrun by Seljuks and Turkomans. Tyre was surrounded, and no\none could travel even from Jerusalem to Ramle. This was no time\nfor a merchant to stay in the country. Hiba returned to Egypt,\nleaving his wife and children with his father-in-law, but without\nproviding for them. Two years had passed without his having sent\neven | dirhem, when, as Eli mournfully remarks, it would have\nbeen his duty to support them (as hungry residents of the Holy\nLand), even if they were not his children. Nor was Ramle cut off\nfrom Egypt. In the same letter Eli conveys to his son-in-law the\nadvice (to be transmitted to him by the recipient of the letter) to\nsend his fax not via Jaffa where it would be seized by the\ncommander of the Fatimid army, but through Ascalon. Thus it was\nnot lack of communications which prevented Hiba from providing\nfor his family; it was neglect.'”\n\nIn the preceding, the term “Holy Land” was used repeatedly\nbecause the wish to settle there on account of its holiness was often\na cause of separation—or served as an excuse for those who wished\nto get rid of their families. Because of the constant anarchy life in\nthe country was almost unbearable. In one of his most beautifully\nstyled letters the Gaon Solomon b. Judah, writing from Jerusalem,\ntells about a scholar of a noble family who had settled in the Holy\nCity, and had left his wife in Egypt because he wanted to make sure\nfirst that he could establish himself there with the means at his\ndisposal. After this was assured, he had sent for his wife, but was\nnot successful. Now the Gaon appeals to a confidant to approach\nthe woman, who was of a fine family, beloved by her husband and\nloving him. “She should not say ‘how can I leave my native country\nand the house of my father and travel to a place where I do not\nknow what will happen to me,” but should rely on God and\ncome.”'® In a letter written in June 1016, long before he became\nGaon, Solomon had to report about another settler in Jerusalem\nwhose Egyptian wile was not prepared to follow him, but did not\naccept his conditions for a divorce.'”\n\nNo wonder that such a situation served as a pretext for desertion.\nThe cases described above are complemented here by a few telling\nexamples.

Judah. A woman deserted by her husband for many\nyears had brought up an only son and when he was old enough had\nsent him out to find his father. But the boy perished on his way.\nAlong with attempts at consolation the Gaon refers to a debt of 300\ndinars and losses incurred by the recipient of his letter (whose\nname is not preserved.) These details, together with the style of the\nletter, which required a thorough knowledge of Hebrew language\nand literature, proves that they were upper middle class people.'®\n\nSolomon b. Judah’s own family was not spared its share of\nmisery. One of his daughters was married in Jerusalem to a man of\na fine Egyptian family, who was far more advanced in age than she.\nThe man left her and the country. [n the beginning he contributed\nto her maintenance. But at the time the Gaon writes again about\nthis, three years had already passed without any communication\nfrom the husband. The Gaon’s son, sent after him to Egypt and\naddressing him and his brother, “the notable,” was not successful in\npersuading him to return to his wife. The Gaon, being the highest\njuridical authority, found himself in an embrassing position. “They\nsay to me ‘you take care of everyone’s suits, why do you not take up\nthe case of your daughter?” ” Nor was he more successful with\nanother son-in-law: after having spent his wife’s dowry (how is not\nsaid), he died leaving her with two daughters and a boy. Thus the\naged Gaon, as he writes, had “five women in the house,” and this in\nyears of famine and constant warfare.'®® The question of how\nstrictly a wife was obliged to follow her husband to the Holy Land,\nand vice versa, is discussed in detail in the Talmud and reflected in\nGeniza documents,\n\nSeveral cases presented above are marked by the length of time\nhusbands were away from home without contacting their families.\nMany more such instances are reported, and some deserve mention\nbecause of special circumstances involved.

We remember the special relationship between a man and\nhis sister’s son.'® When a man died in India after a sojourn there of\nnine years, he left a wife and a girl of eleven, which means that his\nwife must have been comparatively young during that long period\nof absence.'® Another India traveler did not write home for ten\nyears, and the question was asked whether his wife was permitted\n(“since the times were so bad”) to marry another man. The\nhusband had become a Muslim and before setting out for India, his\nwife had demanded a divorce, but he refused, arguing that he\nwould come back soon. The Muslim judge to whom this question\nwas addressed apparently referred it back to a Jewish court, for a\nJewish wife whose husband embraced another religion cannot\nmarry without having received a bill of divorce from him drawn up\naccording to Jewish law.'s” I have already remarked in Med. Soc., 1,\n58, that a father-in-law addresses a deserter absent for twenty-\nthree years as though he had been away for only twenty-three\nweeks.\n\nEven more remarkable is this story of reconcilation. A man had\nstayed away from his wife for eighteen years “like a runaway,” that\nis, he did not let her know about his whereabouts and never sent her\na thing. During the entire period she maintained hersell by her\nown efforts. When he finally came back, “worthy elders” made\npeace between them and they decided to be together “as before.”\nThe only thing the husband had to do was to write her a bill of debt\nthat he owed her 100 dinars, which comes to about 6 dinars per\nyear or half a dinar per month, the usual alimony for a wife among\npeople with modest means. This is simple arithmetic. But one\nwonders how the wife had passed eighteen years during the prime\nof her life as “a widow while her husband was alive and not\npermitted to marry another man.”*\n\nThus far, our attention has been centered on the deserted wife.\nWhat about the neglected children? There was little opportunity to\nmention girls since their education was entrusted to their mothers.\nBut this silence should not be taken as an absence of fatherly\nfeelings. We have read above the mournful words of a scholar from\nByzantium separated from his wife and daughter by adverse\ncircumstances.” Another man from that country stranded in\nEgypt writes that his thoughts were given to his only daughter day\nand night, while a Tunisian who was forced to repudiate his wife in\nConstantinople because he had left that city for good remarks some-\nwhat casually: “Only an infant girl of mine has remained there.”*\n\nGoitein, S.

The obligation to teach\none’s son was taken very seriously and looms large in the corre-\nspondence of absent fathers.'” When tension prevailed between the\ntraveler and his wife at home, he was particularly concerned about\nhis son’s education.'®\n\nAn extraordinary example of this relationship is provided by a\ncalligraphic letter from Damascus, presently preserved in the\nUniversity Museum, Philadelphia. The time was the first quarter of\nthe twelfth century, when the country was in complete turmoil\nbecause of the Seljuk devastations and the subsequent invasion by\nthe Crusaders; prices were exorbitant. A scholarly scribe in Tyre,\nLebanon, father of five, was one of the victims of the hard times. In\norder to feed his family he sold his wife’s jewelry, his own better\nclothing and furnishings, his books and Bible codices, pawned\nother codices in order to borrow money, and took out other loans\nnot covered by collateral. When everything was exhausted, he\ntraveled to Damascus, where his scribal art had better prospects for\nsuccess. This worked for some time, and he sent home whatever he\ncould “for the kids.” But the Damascus community was plagued by\nthe ransom of captives, the most costly charity (see Med. Soc., 11,\n137), and by inner dissension, indirectly caused by the constant state\nof war. Orders for the copying of books ceased, and other sources of\nincome (such as doles to wandering scholars) were discontinued.\nThirteen months had passed without our scribe having been able to\nsend home any substantial contributions. In the face of such\ncalamity he resolved to try his luck in the capital of Egypt, a city\nrenowned for its opulence and charity. But now that he was intent\non traveling to a remote country he wished to have his eldest son\nwith him. The boy, no doubt in connivance with his father, escaped\nfrom the house of the grandfather, where the family lived, and had\nalready reached Saida, Lebanon (about twenty miles north of\nTyre), on his way to Damascus, when his mother sent after him and\nhad him brought back. In the letter, which the scribe wrote to his\nfather-in-law, he implies that the boy’s mother was prepared to\ndesecrate the Sabbath in order to prevent the boy from joining him\nbecause the day he was brought back was a rainy Friday in winter,\nclose upon the beginning of the Sabbath. The mother understood,\nof course, that once the boy was with her husband, he would not be\nso eager to come home. In his ire, our scribe had vowed that unless\nthe boy was sent to him he would never return to Tyre and would\neven repudiate his wife. In his meek and respectful letter to his\nfather-in-law he regrets having made such a foolish vow, but\n\nGoitein, S. D.

It is astounding, though, that the dangers of travel are\nalmost never invoked as an excuse. This passage from an unfor-\ntunately very much damaged letter sent from Tunisia to Egypt is an\nexception confirming the rule: “Your wife came to me to consult\nme whether she should travel to your place. She is undecided, since\nher brothers disapprove of her leaving. Then your letter to the\nelder Abu ’I-Fadl arrived, in which you express apprehension that\nthe sea voyage might be dangerous for them [Abu ’I-Fadl and his\ncompany], knowing their state. If you are afraid, what do you\nexpect from women? I made this suggestion to her: I shall\nsend. ...” Here the manuscript has a hole. At the end of the letter,\nas usual, the writer recapitulates: “If it is right with you that she\ncomes, she will come. It depends entirely on your decision. Do not\nrely on my advice. Of course, the choice is in the hand of God\n[meaning, that men’s decisions are reached by God's decree].”\nClearly, some extraordinary circumstances made a sea voyage at\nthat time inexpedient. The Geniza women were as assiduous\ntravelers as their menfolk. It was not the dangers to be incurred ona\njourney which made wives reluctant to join their distant husbands.\"**\n\nWhat could happen to a wife moving with her husband to a\nforeign country is well illustrated in three lengthy documents, all\nreferring to a woman of true valor, a mother of three, who had\nemigrated from Qayrawan, Tunisia, to Egypt. She was the\ndaughter of a physician and he a scion of a prominent family of\nmerchants and scholars, originating from Msila (today in Algeria),\ncalled al-Jasus (“The Spy”). Both husband and wife bore the name\n“Happy” (he, Surur, she, Surara), but their marriage, at least\nafter their arrival in Egypt, did not bear out such auspicious\nnomenclature. Surar separated from his family; but before he was\nable to leave Egypt, he was brought to court by Surira, in Fustat on\nSunday, February 10, 1040.

She presented that bill to the court in Fustat with the request\nto have it collected in Alexandria. Suriira’s trouble with her\ninsolvent husband recalls the Arab maxim “when a Jew goes\nbankrupt, he searches the old account books of his father.”\nAnyhow, they show the risks incurred by a wife leaving her native\ncity for a foreign country.'®’\n\nActions in court, then as today, were excruciating, and especially\nwith regard to runaway husbands.

On the reverse side of the\ndocument and referring to it, the judge Samuel notifies the Nagid,\nor head of the Jewish community, that he had sent several\nsummons to the man, but since both the High Holidays (approx.\nSeptember) and Hanukka (approx. December) had passed without\nresponse from him, sterner measures were now required, and, to\nthe judge’s dismay, the Nagid had to be troubled. The matter was\nof utmost seriousness since the Alexandrian wife asserted that her\nhusband had married another woman and was living with her in\nCairo. Clearly, the police now had to be instructed to bring the man\nto court by force. But only the Nagid, as official representative of\nthe state, was authorized to give that order.”®\n\nThe most frightful aspect of this dark side of family life in\nGeniza times was the constant menace of the vanishing husband,\nleaving his wife a grass widow, socially and psychologically, a\ncripple. Even a scholar and succesful lecturer, the writer of the first\nof the three letters translated at the end of this subsection, is not\nashamed to conclude his assertions of love and yearnings with the\nthreat to abscond to a foreign country. Still more astounding is the\nfact that persons addressing the highest authorities have the cheek\nto speak openly of their intentions. In a letter to a Nagid written in\nArabic characters the writer describes himself as indebted and\nunable to support his family of six “in these bad times”; “the knife\nhas reached the bone,” and if the Nagid does not help, he will flee\nand travel away, “and the little ones will die of hunger.”**\n\nIf we can empathize with that cry for help, we are revolted by this\nletter of a Karaite scholar to “King Hisday,” the head of his\ncommunity. Itis in the form of a request for a legal opinion, but in\nsubstance is a demand to be granted a divorce with payment of the\nmarriage gift in installments (which, in fact, meant never com-\npletely). Reasons given: in the first place, he had been forced to\nmarry his wife and had done so under duress. Moreover, he had\nsuffered from her bad character and mean deeds for three years,\nwhich were to him like twenty, and he hated her. All this was\ntopped by the arrival in Alexandria, where the couple lived, of his\nmother-in-law. If his demand was not granted, he would travel to a\nfaraway country, never to see his wife again, and she would remain\ndeserted for all her life. The Arabic letter concludes with a Hebrew\nquotation: “I have demolished my house, its stones and beams, and\ngone to foreign parts, never to return.”?*\n\nGoitein, S. D.

But I feel that only actual\nsituations, each different from the other, are able to convey a full\ntdea of the devastation caused by the phenomenon of the runaway\nhusband. Clearly the society was incapable of dealing effectively\nwith this problem, because it was bound by an ancient law, which\nappeared to be the more God-given since it was in conformity with\nthe social notions held by everyone in the wider environment.\n\nPolygyny, levirate, and sororate—Unlike absenteeism, polygyny or\nits threat was not a major trouble for wives. By custom, albeit not by\nlaw, the Geniza society was essentially monogamous. Our dis-\ncussion of the relevant stipulations in the marriage contracts has\nresulted in this observation.*** Threats to the effect that a husband\nmight take another wife were not entirely absent, but they were\nrare, and, one has the impression, not taken too seriously.** Since\npolygyny was legal, though, it could create situations not very\ndissimilar to “triangles” commonplace in modern society, which is\nso different in law and outlook from that of Geniza times.\n\nIn December 1089 a man appeared in court in Fustat and told\nthis story. He had quarreled with his wife, and the matter had\nended in divorce, inclusive of the settlement of the financial\nmatters involved. But he still had tender feelings for her and\nwished to keep her as a wife. Wishing to mollify her and also on\nbehalf of their son, he assigned her monthly payments in cash and\nyearly deliveries of wheat for four years. The payments and\ndeliveries were to be made through their son or in any other way\nshe preferred. If, however, God ordained that she should agree to\nreturn to him, which he desired, the stipulation was void, since, as a\nhusband, he was in any case obliged to maintain her. That\nDecember day of 1089 had a special signifiance for him; on that\nvery day he married another wife.**\n\nThis document reveals the benefits of polygyny. We cannot\nknow, of course, why the man chose to marry another woman.\nAccording to the notions of the society to which he belonged the\nmost likely reason was that he wished to have more than one son, a\ndesire that his aging wife was unable to fulfill. On the other hand,\nhe hated to be separated from his lifelong companion, while she,\nunderstandably, was outraged by his decision. She oo, he felt,\nwould one day prefer sharing life with him in company of another\nwoman rather than missing it altogether, also out of consideration\nfor her son, who was apparently dedicated to father and mother\n\nGoitein, S.

Very rarely does one read about a husband running away\nwith another woman and marrying her against the orders of the\nauthorities.”*”\n\nThe conditions under which a wife would agree to her husband’s\nmarriage to another woman were approximatly these: first, a\nseparate, fully furnished, domicile from which nothing could be\nremoved without her authorization; second, safeguards for all the\nrights stipulated in the marriage contract; there was even a case\nwhere the first wife was paid her delayed marriage gift with the\ncondition to repay it if the second marriage was terminated; third,\nequal rights with regard to clothing, especially on weekends and\nholidays, and conjugal relations; finally the right to receive a\ndivorce if she wished so.\n\nA list of Levis, that is, persons regarded as belonging to the\nbiblical tribe of Levi, contains this item: “Khalaf, the chicken\ndealer, has three sons: Ma'ani etc.; their mother, “the daughter of\nthe woman with the makeup,” is Israelite (not a Levi).

Ma‘ani went off to India asa young man, and there bought,\nmanumitted, and married a local girl. Years later, when he came\nhome with his wife and children, he wished to have a son of his own.\nThe daughter of his maternal uncle might even have waited for\nhim. Sa‘id, the son trom this second marriage, became an India\ntrader like his father and reached the Coromandel coast of\nsoutheastern India.*'®\n\nBe that as it may, our second story of bigamy certainly refers to a\nleading Jewish family in the Mediterranean area. The man, Musa\n(Moses) b. Jekuthiel the Andalusian, was most probably the son of\nthe Spanish Maecenas of Hebrew letters, immortalized by the\npoems of (Solomon Ibn) Gabirol, for the name Jekuthiel is not\nfound elsewhere in Geniza documents except as perpetuated by\nMisa’s son and great-grandson. Miisa was the father of Jekuthiel,\nbetter known as Abu Ya'qub al-Eakim (the doctor), representative\nof the merchants in the Egyptian capital and one of its most\nprominent V.I.P.s during the last quarter of the eleventh century.\nThe first Jekuthiel was executed in Spain in 1039, an end common\nto rich and influential people in those days and parts, and his son\nMusa left his native country and moved eastward, also usual in such\ncases. There, in Fustat, we find him signing a court record and\nbeing referred to in others in 1041 and 1043. In a letter from\nJerusalem to his colleagues on the bench in the Egyptian capital, he\nwrites about public and private affairs, about his meetings with the\nhead of other members of the yeshiva, the central Jewish council,\nand about his intenticn to proceed to Tyre, Lebanon. In doc-\numents related to his son Miisa is referred to as a physician (always\nin Hebrew, meant as an honorific title) but, like other physicians,\nhe was involved in business, and might even have become conspic-\nuous in that field like his renowned contemporary Abu Zikri\nal-Tabib (“the physician”).?!!\n\nWe learn about Misa b. Jekuthiel's family on the occasion of his\ndeath, which was almost as violent as that of his father. A report\nabout this event is included in a letter from the tiny Jewish\ncommunity of the village, day‘a, of Qalhi, or Qalaha, situated on\nthe canal connecting the fertile region of al-Fayyiim with the Nile\n(still existent).?'* The letter is addressed to “the” parnas, or social\nwelfare officer, in Fustat, no doubt Eli ha-Kohen b.

But on their way they were\nassaulted by bandits, stripped of their clothing and everything else,\nand badly manhandled. The dying Masa was visited in Qalhi by his\nson Abii Ya ‘qiib, tne representative of the merchants, who, on his\ntrip (whether from or back to the capital is not stated) also suffered\nindescribable hardships. After a month in the village, Miisa died\npenniless. He had been accompanied by two wives, one from\na noble Karaite family, by whom he had a daughter, and another,\nby whom he had a girl and a boy. A sister of the second wife had\nalso traveled with them. Like their father the two girls died in the\nvillage, probably as a result of physical maltreatment. The noble\nwoman, the letter goes on, could not be left in a place like Qalha.\nTherefore the villagers had hired one of them to accompany her to\nCairo where a paternal cousin of hers was a katib, a government\nofficial, or to any other larger Jewish community. The boy,\nhowever, could not be sent (with his mother and aunt), since, as the\nletter states, he was in danger of sexual abuse from the Negro\nbands on the rampage in the country.*\"*\n\nWe are here in the terrible time of famine and civil war,\n1069—-1072, when the rioting Sudani regiments had overrun most\nof upper Egypt, systematically destroying the country. It explains\nwhy Miisa b. Jekuthiel lived with his family in the Fayyam. The\ngreat famine, which started in 1065, hit the capital in particular,\nbecause it found itself mostly in a stage of siege owing to the clash\nof the various military factions; therefore people tried to find relief\nelsewhere, especially in a place like the fertile Fayyam. I refrain\nfrom offering an explanation for Misa’s bigamy because I have the\nfeeling that further Geniza research will provide us with additional\ninformation about this important family. So much is evident from\nthe leiter summarized above that Masa’s son Aba Ya‘qub Jeku-\nthiel, the representative of the merchants, was not the son of any of\nMiisd’s two wives caught in Qalha. Jekuthiel probably was born in\nSpain, and like many another man in his position, used the\nrelations of his father with his native country to first represent the\nmerchants from there until he became recognized as a leader by\nthe community of merchants in general. What happened to his\nown mother we may learn some day.”'*\n\nGetting permission to marry a second wife was a very com-\nplicated matter, as we learn from a letter written in Minyat Ghamr,\na town in the Nile Delta.

Arriving from Jerusalem in\nMinyat Ghamr (which probably was his native town), he had found\na suitable match for a second marriage. The local judge, who knew\nhis story, had compassion for him, but did not dare to act in such a\ndelicate matter. OQur man went down to Alexandria to submit his\ncase to the next higher legal authority, but Anatoli, the French\nrabbi who was in charge there, stalled. “You know his character\nand his ‘dryness,”” the unhappy man writes. Meanwhile he had\nalready contacted the highest authority, the chief judge Menahém\nin Cairo, but was told he had to come up in person. He could not\ndo so because he could not leave his newly opened store for the\ntime required for such an undertaking. Therefore he asked the\nrecipient, the future judge Elijah, to draw up a petition to the chief\njudge, which Elijah was able to do since he was familiar with the\nnature of the illness of the writer’s wife and the hardships endured\nby her husband. Elijah, like the writer, had lived in Jerusalem. The\nillness probably was mental; it was next to impossible to repudiate\nan insane wife, since the repudiation had to be accepted by her.\nThe writer understood that he would have to come up to Cairo for\nthe wedding (which involved the drawing up of various legal\ndocuments in such a case); this shows that he was hopeful for the\nsuccess of his plea. On the other hand, he asked Elijah to keep the\nmatter secret, which seems to indicate that some hurdles were still\nahead.*'¢\n\nWhen a man married a second wife without permission of the\nfirst and the approval of the authorities, he was liable to excom-\nmunication. How unpleasant an experience it could be might be\nlearned from the story of an excommunicated husband who fled 10\nQis in Upper Egypt, arriving there . . . with his original wife, as\ntold in Med.

A mother\nwho had accompanied her young daughter from the capital where\nshe lived, to a provincial town, the daughter’s domicile, informs her\nson in Fustat that his “little sister” was with child.

A woman from Byzantium, forsaken by\nher husband who was about to marry a local woman, writes: “Who\nis this woman that is prepared to enter a houschold with a rival wife\nand two daughters?”*!®\n\nAnimportant cause of bigamy in Geniza times was the levirate, the\nmarriage of the brother-in-law to the wife of a brother who had\ndied childless. In [slamic society, levirate was a custom, but only in\nJudaism, in that time and region, was it a law.**® The surviving\nbrother was free to refuse the marriage to his sister-in-law by\nundergoing the ceremony described in Deuteronomy 25:7—9. But\nfirst, the brother had to be found, and, second he had to be\nprepared to free the unhappy widow. Since many economic\narrangements were connected with this: the widow’s rights derived\nfrom her marriage contract, and the brother’s prerogatives as the\nheir, endless chicanery and trouble could be endured by the widow\nbefore she was set free. Moreover, the surviving brother could be a\nchild, a minor unable to perform a legal act; in this case the widow\nwas forced to wait for years until anything could be done on her\nbehalf. The Geniza contains considerable material about these\nmatters.\n\nThe student of [slam is reminded of the koranic law prescribing\nthat a husband cannot retake his wife after he had repudiated her\nunless she has concluded and consummated a marriage with\nanother man. The law intended to protect the wife against a hasty\nrepudiation, made in an hour of quarrel and anger. The intention\nwas good, but the legal instrument created for its implementation\nwas a disaster, a constant irritation and ailment of Islamic society.\nSimilarly, the levirate marriage was well suited to the peasants’\nworld of ancient Israel with brothers sitting together on a piece of\nland (Deuteronomy 25:5), where a widow had nowhere to go after\nthe death of her husband. It became a monstrosity in the urban\nsociety of Geniza times. The Karaites were reasonable enough to\noutlaw the levirate altogether by applying to the relevant Bible\npassage the intricate methods of Islamic (Mu'‘tazilite) Koran inter-\npretation.?®® The Rabbanite divines of Egypt ruled that the levirate\ndid not override their antibigamy statute. In others words, if a man\nwished to marry the widow of his brother, he had first to divorce\nhis wife and to pay all her dues; this attitude made levirate\nmarriage destitute in practice.

Because of the great\nauthority of the Master this decision prevailed, at least among\nOriental Jews.*!\n\nIn the early 1930s, when it was still possible, I made a painstaking\ncase study of the levirate, then fully alive among the Jews of\nYemen, great admirers and followers of Maimonides. I was\nastounded to learn to what length both partners to the levirate, the\nbrother and the widow, went in order to fulfill a heavenly com-\nmandment, which seemed the more sacrosanct and meritorious the\nmore senseless and harmful it was in practice.” Remembering that\nexperience of mine I fancy that at least some of the persons about\nwhose sufferings by an outdated law we read in the Geniza might\nhave been indemnified and fortified by a similar religious posture.\nA number of cases of levirate marriage are described in the note.**®\n\nHow the levirate entailed bigamy is impressively illustrated in a\nmarriage agreement made between a Nagid, or head of the Jewish\ncommunity of Egypt, and the widow of his brother, the Nagid who\npreceded him. This happened on June 5, 1482, near the end of the\nMamluk period of Egyptian history, with which the office of the\nNagid also came to an end. In accordance with Maimonides’ ruling,\nFaraj (“Relief”), the widow of Yesha'a (“Salvation™), son of Joseph\n(who, too, had been a Nagid) married her brother-in-law Solomon\nunder the usual conditions of equality between the two wives (“one\nnight with this, one night with that”) and the continuation of the\nprerogatives resulting from her former marriage contract. There\nwas, however, an additional stipulation, necessitated by the office\nof the Nagid. At the yearly pilgrimage to the holy shrine of\nDammiih the Nagid was, of course, accompanied by his wife. It\nwas one of the rare occasions of her public appearance. Who of the\ntwo should be the companion? Here the wife of the former Nagid\nreceived some preference: not more than two days of the festive\nweek was the new holder of that office to stay with his first\nspouse.’**\n\nThe levirate—a man replacing his brother—was matched by the\nsororate, its female pendant. That a sister should take a dead wife’s\nplace was neither law nor custom. But the actual occurrence of\nthose unions must have been frequent, if we are to judge from the\ncasual way in which relevant actions are reported. Apparently it\nwas regarded as natural for a father to give a daughter to a\nbereaved son-in-law, even when she had already been promised,\nengaged, or betrothed to another man.

A girl had been be-\ntrothed to a youth still under his father’s control (but not a minor),\nwhen her father learned that his future in-laws had suffered great\nlosses in dealings with Ram, probably Italians. In order to dissolve\nthe connection, the father argued that his daughter did not like her\nfuture spouse, which, according to Qayrawinese Jewish (probably\nalso Muslim) custom, was sufficient reason for demanding a\ndivorce (as needed after a betrothal). The fewish judge to whom the\ncase was submitted did not regard the girl's pretended dislike for\nthe betrothed as sufficient reason for a divorce. In this impasse, the\nfather came up with another idea which appeared to be more\nacceptable: the girl had to substitute for her sister who had died a\nfew months earlier, leaving babies who had to be taken care of. The\nMuslim authorities to whom the case was submitted, as usual, sent it\nback to a Jewish jurisconsult of high rank, who was more inclined\nto accept the first argument: the Qayrawanese custom. Old women\nwere sent to the girl, and when they found out that she was\nadamant in her refusal to marry the youth to whom her father had\nbetrothed her, the jurisconsult ruled that he was obliged to set her\nfree, and the bill of divorce was written.??¢\n\nHow a marriage with a wife substituting for her dead sister\nworked can be learned from the documents about the woman from\nSahrajt which are discussed above in connection with the super-\nvision of family life by the authorities. Both her sister and the\nlatter’s child had died; thus we see, it was not only caring for babies\nwhich made for the “female levirate.” A house belonging to the\ndead sister and her daughter had been inherited by the widower, as\nwas the law. But the newlywed resented being a stranger in a house\nthat had been the property of her own family, and took possession\nof the deeds. This was not the only source of friction, and a divorce\nsettlement was arranged before a Muslim judge in that little town.\nThe case came before the rabbinical court in Fustat which ordered\nfurther inquiries, the results of which have not yet turned up.

In a fit of\nindignation she had torn up her marriage contract, which was of\ncourse a very foolish thing to do. Now, it was up to her to retract\nand to mend her ways.\n\nShe came before us and said: ‘I have sinned, make peace between us.\nShe wept, she and her son, in the presence of the community. Everyone\nprodded her husband Abraham, saying: ‘Why do you not take her back?’\nSaid he: ‘She treats me with contempt, me and my family, my brother, my\nsister, and their sons, and all my relatives.” We investigated this statement\nand found that it was true. Consequently, we had her make the symbolic\npurchase [required for making a commitment binding], by which Salma,\nthe daughter of Nathan, took upon herself the following obligations\ntoward her husband, Ibrahim b. Salim: She will stand up in his presence\nwhenever he enters or leaves a room. She will serve and treat him with\nrespect, be neat, and not refuse to do any work usually done in a house.\nWhen she sees him sorrowful, she will not argue with him, nor will she ask\nhim to buy her expensive clothing, which he is not able to provide. She will\nnot scorn him with contemptuous and derisive words, but be submissive\ntoward him and his relatives. When mentioning his name or that of his\nrelatives, she will add the honorific epithets due them [such as ‘may God\nenhance his honored position’]. She will not improperly disobey him, in\nword or deed, and leave the house only with his permission. She will not\ndemand that they move to the capital or any other place, unless he himself\nwishes to do so. [This was probably promised when they married]. In\ngeneral, she should honor and serve him with respect, and never sit idle in\nthe house, but either occupy herself with work on flax and wool, or the\nhousehold, such as baking and cooking. Salma, the daughter of Nathan,\nundertook all these obligations unconditionally. Whenever she fails in any\none of these, her husband is free to divorce her with no court refusing\nhim the permission to do so. Abraham b. Salim, on his side, promised to\nbe with her with all his heart, with undivided attention, and, like virtuous\nJewish men, to honor her and treat her with respect, also, to buy her\nclothing, as far as his means permit.\n\nThis tenth-century document from the Egyptian countryside\nshows how a weak male tries to insure his superiority over a strong\nfemale.?*®\n\nQuite a different world confronts us in a settlement made in\nFustat about a century and a half later, in summer 1142.

The\nfather, unable to provide his daughter with a proper outfit, had\ngiven her a house instead, and sold those items of the dowry which\nhis daughter disliked. Three questions had to be settled. The\nfather had yet to register the house with the state authorities in the\nname of his daughter; who would pay for the fees and taxes at that\ntransaction? The house needed repairs; who would have a say in\nthe way these repairs would be carried out and who would pay for\nthem? Finally and most important: the husband had to under-\nstand, once for all, that he would have no right of usufruct of the\nhouse, but that the income from it would be used for his wife’s\nclothing.\n\nThe agreement reached was as follows: The father had to\nregister the house in the name of his daughter within three\nmonths; the taxes and fees, amounting to 12 gold pieces, a very\nconsiderable sum for poor people, had to be borne by the couple\n(customarily the buyer paid the transfer costs); of these, the\nhusband paid 3 and the wife 9 dinars, reason not stated; although\nshe was entitled to keep the rent for herself, he would inherit the\nhouse, or one half of it, in case she died before him childless. He\nrenounced his right of usufruct, and if he so much as mentioned\nsuch a demand, he would pay “to the poor” a fine of 3 dinars. The\nson-in-law had no claims as to how the repairs should be carried\nout; on the other hand the father-in-law was not entitled to ask him\nor his daughter to share in the expenses for them. Finally, the\nfather had to hand over to his daughter the sums received from the\nsale of objects from her outfit. In case the father failed to meet\nthese obligations the marriage was terminated and the husband’s\ndelayed gift forfeited. The warning to the husband not to beat or\ncurse his wife meant that the court would force him to repudiate\nher if any such complaints against him were to be established. We\nsee that agreements, even between common people, show a high\ndegree of “freedom of contract” not envisaged by the law.*’\n\nNaturally, settlements, even if arranged by the most competent\njudge, did not always endure. We had such cases before. One,\nwhich particularly impressed me, serves to conclude this topic. It\nconcerned the moot question of the wife’s freedom of movement:\nthe woman bore the proud and utterly exceptional name Zafira.\n“Victorious,” or Victoria. The document lacks beginning and end.\nbut is written in the late style of Halfon b. Manasse, around 1135.\nor perhaps even later.

When a woman, especially one of the\nlower sectors of the population, one who had no family backing\nher, despaired of obtaining her legal rights in court, she adopted\nthe extreme measure open to anyone wronged or otherwise\nsuffering: she appealed to the community. We have already\nencountered appeals by an orphan and her minor sister, both\ndriven from their house by their own family, and by a captive just\nransomed, in need of the most essential necessities of life. Here is\none by a woman totally neglected by her husband:\n\nIn Your name, oh All Merciful.\n\nOh Community of Israel, I appeal to God and to you.\n\nI am a young woman, whom God the exalted—whose judgments we\naccept—has made miserable by marrying a man known as Joseph b.\nKulayb [or: Caleb], the brother-in-law of Ibn Tarstin, the cantor.

Amen. Selah.\n\nThere are other such complaints, preserved in the Geniza **\n\nMarital strife was not the only cause of friction that occasioned\nsettlements in court. There were many varied reasons why couples\nfound it advisable to have their mutual agreements legalized by a\nnotary or a judge, for instance, to forestall claims by or against\nheirs, to protect property in time of general insecurity, or, simply,\nto safeguard rights that, for any reason, needed clarification.\nSettlements normally required several actions, as when a spouse\nmade a gift of a house to the other spouse which needed regis-\ntration before both a Muslim and a Jewish authority, or when a\nhusband ceded to his wife full disposition over her dowry, or\nreleased her from a debt she owed him. The nature of the Geniza,\nwhich, remember, is not an orderly archive but its opposite, means\nthat we usually have only one document of two or more referring\nto a settlement. For example, in June 1244, Labwa b. Aba Ghalib\n(“Lioness, daughter of Subduer”) renounced to her husband all he\nowed her from her marriage gift, dowry, and other obligations,\nsuch as a debt to her, and, on top of this, undertook to maintain\ntheir younger son for ten years and their elder son for two years,\nincluding the payment of the latter’s poll tax and expenses for his\napprenticeship in the art of silversmithing. Their father had only to\nprovide the boys with clothing. Against all this, the only thing he\ndid in this settlement was to release Labwa from all claims he might\nhave had against her—before men or before God. The claims had\nbeen spelled out, of course, in another document. They are\nreferred to here in a general way to explain the extraordinary\nsacrifices made by the wife.**?\n\nSuch partial testimonies to settdlements made out of marital\ncooperation are included in many Geniza papers. Wills and death-\nbed declarations were other legal ways for expressing such re-\nlationships, see subsections C, 3 and 4, below.\n\nThree letters—As promised earlier, three letters of husbands to\ntheir wives are given here in translation.

Utility, economic and other-\nwise, got a poor average of 9 percent of the respondents, and moral\nand religious incentives a negligible 6.6 percent.!\n\nFor the Geniza, naturally, I am unable to provide statistics. A\nfurther disadvantage of the subsequent inquiry is the discouraging\nfact that my “respondents” are almost exclusively male, a disad-\nvantage somewhat lessened by the observation that in the Hoffman\nnational survey the answers of men and women differed only\nslightly, which might indicate that given the same cultural am-\nbiance the opinions of spouses about the advantages of having\nchildren are pretty much the same. Our lack of statistics is\ncompensated for by the clarity and emphasis with which the basic\nvalues emerge from our documents.\n\nThe massive evidence of the Geniza proves that children, that is,\nsons, formed a prominent, central, and, so to say, public com-\nponent in a man’s life to a far higher degree than is customary in\nour own society. When you write a business letter to a person who\nhas no sons, you pray that God may give him *“male children\nstudying the Torah and fulfilling its commandments.” When he\nhas sons, you wish him that God may keep them, or you may add\nthat the father should “see their Torah,” that is, success in study,\n“their good works, and their ‘joy,”” that is, wedding. If they arc\ngrown up, greetings must be extended to them, each in accordance\nwith the circumstances. Even a complete stranger, writing a\nbegging letter—and many have found their way into the Geniza—\nfirst carefully inquires about the family of the addressee in order to\ninsert the proper wishes for his progeny.*\n\nThe religious merit of having children is discussed above.?\nProcreation is an explicit commandment of the Bible, and God’s\nlaw can be preserved only if it is studied and kept, now and forever.\nHence the great emphasis not only on children but also on\ngrandsons and great-grandsons. It seems strange to us that in\nletters in which fathers are wished to witness their son’s study and\nmarriage they are wished also to see the same from grandsons and\ngreat-grandsons, as happened to Joseph (Genesis 50:23) or Job\n(42:16).* Those wishes sound especially odd in a letter of con-\ngratulation on the circumcision of a boy eight days old.* Under-\nlying all this is the Talmudic idea that “he who hears a lection from\nthe mouth of his grandson is like the one who has heard it [from\nGod] on Mount Sinai.”®\n\nThe precedence of “study” over “good deeds” in the wishes for\nsuccess with children should not be taken too literally.

Simple wishes that the\naddressee’s children grow up as righteous and honest men are not\nlacking either.”\n\nAlongside religious and moral motives, the utilitarian and\negotistic incentive that a son become a support and source of\nstrength for his father appears frequently in letters. This wish is\nregularly expressed with the phrase “may God strengthen your\n(upper) arm through him,” written in Arabic or Hebrew, and\nfound throughout the centuries.® The phrase originated in ancient\ntimes, when, during tribal warfare, a multitude of sons was the\nsafest protection for an aging father, but it also had its legitimate\nplace in the urban society of the Geniza period: family partner-\nships, presided over by fathers, were the strongest business firms,\ncraftsmen worked together with their sons, and professionals and\ndignitaries enhanced their prestige and influence when they had\nsons ready to take over their positions, which they themselves often\nhad inherited from their fathers.® The Bible verse most frequently\nquoted in the Geniza is Psalms 45:16: “Instead of your fathers shall\nbe your sons [you will make them princes all over the country].”\n\"This is said not only in letters to high dignitaries, such as a Nagid, a\njudge, or a great scholar, like Maimonides, where it is common, but\nalso in simple family letters.'® Another biblical phrase, “may he [the\nson] sit on your [the father’s] chair” (I Kings 3:6 and elsewhere) is\nalso used in this connection, even in addressing a low community\nofficial, such as a cantor, who is wished this with regard to his two\nsons and his future grandsons and great-grandsons.\"\n\nIn the Hoffman survey this “expansion of the self” is rated 35\npercent, the third strongest incentive for the desire to have\nchildren. In the Geniza period, taken together with the utilitarian-\negotistic motivation of which it forms a part, it should be regarded\nas powerful as the religious and moral considerations—if not more\ns0.\n\nPaternal affection is expressed in terms of endearment by which\na man would refer to his son, or which would be used by others\naddressing the father. “My son, the joy of my eye” (which is\nidiomatic Arabic, and not a translation of the corresponding\nbiblical phrase, Ezekiel 24:25, Lamentations 4:2) and “the dearest\nto me of all mankind” are the most commonly used expressions.'?\n“The lovely flower,” “the blossoming rose,” originally perhaps said\nof children, can refer also to grown-up sons; muhja, “lifeblood,” is\nanother strong term.** The most common word of endearment for\nson is hamid, “delight,” so common that the Hebrew letter 4 stands\nin memorial and other lists simply for “son of.\"™\n\nGoitein, S.

A family Bible, lost in the pillage of Qayrawan (1057), had\nbeen “ransomed” from the marauders, the missing folios replaced,\nand the costly manuscript sent to Egypt as a gift to the baby son.\n\nA letter of congratulation on the birth of a son, written in perfect\nscript and language and entirely dedicated to the subject, is even\nmore exuberant. Opening with Psalms 127:3-5, (“like arrows in\nthe hand of a warrior are the sons of one’s youth . . .”), verses that\nextol the role of sons as defenders and supporters of their fathers, it\nenumerates all the secular motivations for having sons in highly\nstylized rhymed Arabic prose.

In the house of\nworship Jewish girls, like their Christian compatriots, were con-\nfined to the women’s gallery. They did not actively participate in\nthe services; they could profit individually from what they were\nable to perceive, but they did not “study.” “The men to learn, the\nwomen to listen.”®® Thus the religious motive of spiritual per-\npetuation did not apply to girls. From the utilitarian-egotistic point\nof view they were a net loss: a father had to work all his life for\nreadying appropriate outfits for them. In a deathbed declaration a\nman assigns 100 dinars to each of his three minor daughters for\ntheir future outfits, leaving the rest of his property to his two sons;\nbut how hard had a man to work in those days for earning even a\nquarter-dinar!*!\n\nFinally, as to the motivation of physical continuation, an ancient\nmaxim, both Jewish and Arab, says: “The sons of sons are like sons,\nthe sons of daughters are not.”® How deep-seated such notions\nwere even among mothers was brought home to me when I read\nthis passage in the letter of a noble old woman, writing from Raqqa\non the Euphrates to one of her sons in Egypt: “You [plural] have\nleft me with your sister and this you yourself have wished, but how\nlong can a person live in other peoples’ houses?!”**\n\nCompare this with what the same woman writes in order to\nexpress her yearnings after her son, who had failed to com-\nmunicate with her during the entire summer (when letters were\ncarried by travelers): “Send me your worn shirts and with their\ndirt, so that I may revive my spirit with them,” that is, by looking at\nthem and inhaling their smell, a reminiscence of the Islamic (not:\nbiblical) Joseph story, where Jacob is revived and his blindness is\nhealed when Joseph’s shirt, sent to him from Egypt, is cast over his\nface.**\n\nNo wonder, then, that a report about the death of a girl is\nregularly followed by the wish that she may be replaced by a boy,\nsometimes accompanied by the consolation that God might accept\nthe child’s death as an atonement for the father’s sins. (It was\nbelieved that babies die for their fathers’ sins, since they could not\nhave committed a sin themselves.) “The family is fine and in good\nshape after the disaster that occurred with the little girl.

If affection, giving and\nreceiving love, has been found to be the strongest motivation for the\ndesire of having children in contemporary U.S.A., how much more\nmust that have been so in a time and place where the elementary\nhuman urges were far more pronounced. Girls, especially when\nthey are small, often are more lovable than boys. “I prefer girls,”\nsaid Rav Iisda, a prominent Talmudic sage. His medieval\ncommentators, perplexed by so preposterous a dictum, explained\nthat Hisda’s sons-in-law were greater scholars than his sons. But,\nthe context suggests, that the sage preferred girls for their own\nsake, and similar opinions are recorded in the name of Muslim\nauthorities.*®\n\nThe relationships between parents and daughters, as emerging\nfrom the Geniza, are discussed below. Here it should be noted that\neven among common people blaming a wife for producing a girl\nmust have been regarded as improper. A very simple man, who\nquarreled with his wife because her father had not made the\npayments promised to the young couple, absented himself and\nrefused to return until the payments were made. A lawsuit was\npending at the Nagid’s court.

A comprehensive study of the numerous references of\nthis type would be desirable in order to appraise these emotional\nevaluations.®® I should like, however, to draw attention to a remark\nin the commentary of the Nagid Abraham, the son of Moses\nMaimonides on Genesis 31:17: “Jacob mentions children prior to\nwives, for children are the purpose of being with women, although\nin reality they come later, while Esau mentions the women first,\nbecause his thoughts are given to them.” It is the patriarch Jacob\nwho, of course, does the right thing. Thus, the pious Nagid\nAbraham seems to have regarded the custom of mentioning\nchildren prior to wives as religiously commendable.*\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "viii, C, 2 Parents and Children 231\n\nThe appearance of [the pregnancy of] Sitt Ghalb (“Lady Overcoming,”\nAbu ‘Alf’s wife) was perceived in the middle of Shawwal, known as [the\nJewish] month of Teveth. Then it was established for Marheshvan [two\nmonths earlier]. I vowed that if it were a boy, I would give as alms at his\ncircumcision a hundred pounds of bread and a lamb, and I would call him\nAbu Sa‘d after my brother, may God have mercy upon him.”™?\n\nThe happy father was none other than Aba ‘Ali Ezekiel b.\nNethanel Ibn al-Dimyat], the brother of the scholarly India trader\nHalfon b. Nethanel. Halfén was a bachelor and took his nephew\nAbu ’I-Fakhr, the boy listed above, into his business. Since that\nhappened in the 1140s, the date of the first note written above\nmust have been 1129 or 1130, for only in those two years did the\nMuslim and Jewish months mentioned coincide. Abu ’l-Fakhr\nprobably was named after his maternal grandfather; it is very likely\nthat “Lady Overcoming” had stipulated this at her marriage.\n\nThe erratic way in which these notes were written explains\nperhaps why so few of them have survived.\n\nWomen wrote freely about their pregnancies and so did their\nhusbands, and good wishes were extended to them. “I am in my\nsixth month,” writes a woman (who had a married daughter) to her\nmaternal uncle, asking him urgently to visit her, “for death and life\nare in the hand of God.”® Another woman with child asks her\nsister and mother to take more interest in her because of her\ncondition. In the two letters in which she makes this request she\nalso speaks about her children, a girl and a boy.* “Your daughter is\nwell and in her fourth month” writes a son-in-law from Alexandria\nto his uncle and father-in-law in Fustat and immediately adds: “We\nare upset because of the plague in Fustat, about which we have\nheard here.”® Labrit I b. Moses 1, in the letter quoted earlier in\nthis section makes this short remark: “The girl who is with me [his\nwife] is busy [pregnant|. I wish her safety.”!\n\nIt is natural in an extended family for the woman of the house\nand her daughter-in-law to be expecting at the same time. With\nIsaiah 66:7 they are wished to give birth to a male child before\nbeing in labor. The well-wisher, a relative of the dowager, asks “for\nher month”; if he can manage, he will try to visit at the time of the\nbirth. Such remarks are frequent.*\n\nThe women of the Geniza period seem to have inherited\nsomething of the robustness of their ancestors prior to the Exodus\nfrom Egypt, of whom it was reported: “They are vigorous and give\nbirth before the midwife comes to them” (Exodus 1:19).

It cannot be a taboo concerning things female, since\nillnesses of women are reported as much as those of men. There\nare a few references to the deaths of mothers at delivery, or shortly\nafter, but far fewer than one would expect.* Yet the risk of\nchildbirth was great. We have wills of pregnant women (one\ndeclaring that she was entering her ninth month) made in antici-\npation of the possibility. Two wills provide for the child, “male or\nfemale,” who would survive the mother, one also giving generously\nto charities and relatives, and one turning over the testator’s assets\nto her mother on condition she brings up the newborn, while the\nhusband will be free of any obligation. The idea behind this will\nwas, of course, that the husband would soon marry again and that a\ngrandmother would be a better substitute for a mother than a\nstepmother.*\n\nThe subject of birth appears in the Geniza mainly as a social\nevent. We hear little about the physical or medical aspect. “Son of\nthe Midwife,” “Son of the Little [female] Doctor” are family names,\nbut we do not learn anything of importance about the activities of\nthese professionals attending a woman at childbirth.*® The main\nconcern of the family was to receive properly the many women who\ncame to see the young mother.* In the case of the birth of a boy,\nthe circumcision ceremony, following eight days later, was a great\naffair, second in commotion only to a wedding. Solemn and\nprotracted additional prayers were recited both on the Sabbath\npreceding the circumcision and during the ceremony itself; we\nhave reports about what liturgies were read at such “a tremendous\nassembly.”® The privilege of leading the circumcision cefemonies\n(and receiving the honorarium going with them), mentioned in\nMed. Soc., 11, 86, seems to refer to the recitation of prayers rather\nthan to the actual operation. Attendance at the ceremony was a\nvery sensitive matter of prestige for high and low; hence the letters\nof inquiry and apology sent on such an occasion.*® Poems with good\nwishes were read out, of course, in anticipation of a reward. A\ncircumcision ceremony was also a good occasion for sending in a\nbegging letter, and we have already read about an expecting father\nvowing a festive meal for the poor.*\n\nAs an aside I should like to mention that a Jewish judge in\nAlexandria (who was also a physician) was accused by an adversary\nof wasting his time circumcising Christian, that is, Coptic, boys,\ninstead of a attending to his duties at the Jewish court of the city.\n\nGoitein, S.

But the\nproud father would list somewhere the exact date, preferably\naccording to the various eras of his own and other communities\nknown to him. Thus one birth is listed according to the Coptic, the\nMuslim, and two Jewish calendars, another according to four\nJewish eras (Creation, Era of the Documents, Destruction of the\nSecond Temple, and Jubilee Years) and Muslim chronology, and\nis, in addition, accompanied by a horoscope.®* A carefully executed\nhoroscope, written by the learned cantor and clerk Hillel b.

When a distinguished woman in\nJerusalem died, leaving a boy of two and a half years, he was\nclaimed by his paternal aunt, who was none other than the wife of\nthe Gaon Elijah b. Solomon. But the Gaon himself ruled that the\nboy should stay where he was because he would feel better in his\naccustomed environment. No doubt, female members in the\nwidower’s household had looked after him during his mother’s last\nillness, and in the same letter we read that her sister was already on\nher way from Egypt to Jerusalem, probably to fill the dead woman’s\nplace.™ A widow with a littde boy in Minyat Zifta, a town in the\nEgyptian Delta, receives from her future husband this contrac-\ntually confirmed promise: “He will feed and clothe this orphan and\nteach him a craft. He will be to him like the children borne to him by\nthe bride, he will not turn him out, or beat, or humiliate him with\nwords.”” And how lovely is this report from Damascus about a boy\nwho was left by his father with relatives when he traveled to Egypt:\n“He is happy and gay in the company of our children. He goes to\nschool with them, dresses like them,™ and plays with them. He is\nnot a stranger.

To the examples provided in Med.\nSoc., 11, 174, others could be added, for example, one, in which\nthe mother is admonished also to watch that the little one, who still\nneeded assistance in washing his hands, should say the proper\nbenedictions over bread, wine, and water.” A father mourning his\nson, who died at the age of six, eulogizes him for never playing in\nthe street or at home, for running to the gate of the house to\nwelcome the needy and share his food with him, “whether he had\nplenty or little,” and for delighting his father with intelligent\nquestions.

The one just quoted, namely, that a small boy willingly\nshared his food with a beggar standing at the door of the house, is a\ngood example. When a father in al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, on the eve\nof the New Year sends his daughter’s old clothes to Fustat, Egypt,\nwhere they were to be sold and the proceeds sent to Jerusalem for\nthe maintenance of orphans, we can hardly fail to see in this an edu-\ncational intention. At the beginning of the new year, a girl received\none or several new dresses. Her old dresses were hers; she could sell\nthem and buy herself something she liked; but she was taught better:\nshe should think about girls who had no father to buy them a new\ndress, about girls far away. Was this not a very practical way to teach\nchildren both altruism and love for the Holy City?\"®\n\nThe alertness of a child, in particular his attentiveness to\nmembers of the extended family, is a topic occasionally touched\nupon in letters. A man in Alexandria writes to his brother in Fustat,\nafter another brother had died, about his own boy Miisa (Moses),\nwho bore the same name as his dead uncle: “The little one begins to\nspeak clearly, and this is what he says all the time: ‘My uncle, my\nuncle Musa.” May God have mercy upon Musa [the dead uncle],\nand give life to Masa [the child].”” In two other letters from\nAlexandria, sent by Nathan b. Nahray to his illustrious second\ncousin Nahray b. Nissim, Nathan describes how his little son, also\ncalled Nahray, always inquires about rabbénii “our master” (as the\nvisitor was addressed in the house after the latter had departed).\n“My boy Nahray is angry with us and is always saying, ‘When do\nrabbéni and Aba Sa'd [the latter’s boy] come?” And he says,\n‘Bring me to him.” We say to him all the time, “They are in the\nsynagogue; presently they will come.” ” Little Nahray cannot have\nbeen more than three or four years old, for at that age he would\nhave accompanied his father to the house of worship. This short\npassage also shows that then, as always, one told little lies to\nchildren.®\n\nGoitein, S. D.

During the weck the\nboys were in school, where also the prayers were said. But on\nSabbaths and holidays the boys were taken by their fathers to\nsynagogue and attended service there even when the father was\nabroad.®” Girls frequented the women’s gallery with their mothers\nInvitations to weekends, holidays, and family events invariably\nincluded “the little ones.”®® And the very early participation of teen-\nagers in economic life brought them into constant contact with the\nworld of the adults.\n\nItis difficult to provide exact data in this matter since our sources\nspeak about the adolescent mostly in general terms and do not\nindicate his years. It was taken for granted that a girl of ten and her\nelder sister, who already had attained puberty, would work (in\nembroidery, in the case concerned).®* When, in a legal opinion, it is\nsaid of a girl of nine years, “She spins with them every day and\nearns with this her livelihood and more,” one has the impression that\nthis was regarded as exceptional.® A Karaite court decision from\nthe year 1004 has this to say about a boy of fifteen: “Although this\nmaster Aaron is only fifteen years old, he is possessed of common\nsense, shrewdness, understanding, and prudence, and knows how\nto handle commercial transactions. Still it is the general opinion [of\nthe experienced merchants assembled to opine about the case] not\nto leave his part in the inheritance in his hands.”**\n\nStrict law was different. This is a question submitted to Mai-\nmonides, about two hundred years after the case just mentioned:\n“A boy of fifteen came to the synagogue [where the court was held].\nA man produced a document issued a year before showing that the\nboy owed him money. ... Some said that he was a minor and his\ntransactions were not valid. Then it was established by witness that\nhe was fifteen. Some opined that he [i.e., his capacity to act legally]\nshould be examined. ... The matter remained undecided until\nwe receive your instructions. . . .” Answer: “He is to be regarded as\none who has come of age since this has been established by witness.\nHis mental capacity need not be examined.”’\n\nMaimonides decided here in accordance with the law that\nidentified puberty (assumed to be reached by boys at thirteen) with\nlegally coming of age. Only certain transactions with immovables\nwere excluded from the adolescent’s free disposition until he\nreached the age of twenty.*® In a court record from Bilbays, Lower\nEgypt, from spring 1217, an elder brother receives the admini-\nstration of a minor sibling’s share in their father’s inheritance and\ntakes it upon himself to maintain him “until he reached maturity at\n\nGoitein, S.

But here, as in the\ncase of the Karaite court ruling of 1004, quoted above, and in\ncountless other cases,®* matters were decided according to practical\nconsiderations. When, in summer 1232, witnesses testify that an\nadolescent was “mature and displaying eagerness and endeavor to\nearn his own livelihood,” they clearly referred not only to his\nphysical maturity but also to his mental capacity. After having been\nin business for sixty years a man boasts that as a boy whose beard had\nnot yet become apparent he was already renowned for his probity.\nAll in all, it becomes apparent that both girls and boys entered\neconomic life at a very early stage. Childhood came to an end soon,\nor, rather, it was an imperfect stage in a man’s lifespan. The sooner\nit was terminated, the better. But the education of adolescents was\nno less a concern than that of children.®\n\nThe size of the nuclear family.—What was the average number of\nchildren in a nuclear household? By that we do not mean the num-\nber of children born. We cannot know this, for children stillborn or\ndying early normally do not appear in our documents.” More-\nover, we must remember that daughters were never mentioned in\nmemorial lists and rarely greeted in letters. Often we learn about\nthem only circumstantially. Thus we might conclude that Moses\nMaimonides had only one brother and one sister, but a Geniza letter\nto him by his hitherto unknown sister Miriam in which she greets his\nsisters shows that he had at least three sisters.** Finally, most of our\ninformation comes from normal, fairly well-off families. We learn\nabout poor people when a man complains about his big household,\nwhich he is unable to support, or from lists of paupers, where only\na few members live at home, in many cases certainly because the\nboys had to leave their parents at a very tender age to seek a\nlivelihood.*®\n\n‘The Geniza is rich in information about the size of the nuclear\nfamily, and over the years I have collected much material about this\n\nGoitein, S.

The release from any claim, given by a\nwoman called Turayk, or Little Turk, to a representative of\nmerchants, specifying the names of his three sons and three\ndaughters, is discussed above.” An India trader, before setting\nout on his voyage (on which he was murdered), makes detailed\nprovisions for his three sons and three daughters.®” A will makes\nthe dying man’s wife guardian with far reaching rights over his\nthree minor daughters and two sons.*® Two married daughters and\nthree adult sons were the heirs of a man from Qayrawan in 1034;\none married daughter and four sons appear in an inquiry about the\nestate of their father; another four sons and a girl are mentioned in a\nquestion about the inheritance of a poor parnis; and at least five\nbrothers shared the inheritance of a house in 1238.%° We have wills\nfor a single child, one for a son, another for a daughter, and one\nfor a single daughter inheriting the entire estate of her father '\nBetween the extremes of families with five or six children and\nothers with only one there are, of course, many intermediate\nexamples in legal documents.\n\nInstances of seven children mentioned in connection with cases\nof inheritance are rare. A man from Alexandria, whose brother\nhad died on board ship en route to Yemen claims a share in the\nestate, emphasizing that his household consisted of nine souls,\nwhich probably means that he had seven children. A question\nsubmitted to Maimonides speaks of five sons, two of whom had\ncome of age, two daughters, and a widow left behind by a man who\nhad appointed two executors of his will.'* I have not noted a will,\nor a similar document, made for eight children as heirs.\n\nAppeals to authorities, or to the community at large, in which the\nsupplicant mentions the number of his or her children as a reason\nfor the request, have a semi-official character and should also be\nregarded as fairly reliable. A community official in Acre (Acco)\nwho had five daughters, but no son, complains that he had lost\nmuch of his income since the Crusaders (who had conquered the\ncity in 1104, not long before the letter was written) did not permit\nthe ritual killing of animals, from which he derived a considerable\npart of his income.'”® A widow who had lost four grown-up sons\n\nGoitein, S.

We have, however, clear examples where persons reared\nchildren with whom they had no family connection whatever. In\ntime of great calamity, probably at the beginning of the Crusaders\nperiod, when many female prisoners had to be ransomed and\ncared for, a woman, herself a mother of three girls and two boys,\ntook a little girl into her house and brought her up “in order to\nacquire a religious merit.” Unfortunately, the story did not end as\nbeautifully as it began. After four or five years, when the girl\nmatured, one of the two boys asked her to marry him. But the\nmarriage lasted only a few weeks.

Widowhood, Divorce, and Remarriage\n\nWidowhood—We read much about widows in the Geniza, but\nlittle about widowers. The reason for the difference should not be\nsought in a higher rate of male mortality.\" It was caused by the\nentirely different situations in which husbands and wives found\nthemselves after the demise of their spouses. A husband’s social\nand economic status was affected hardly at all by the death of his\nwife. [f not otherwise stipulated, he was heir to her dowry and\nother possessions, and was freed from the obligation of paying the\ndelayed marriage gift, a heavy financial liability. As to the domestic\nchores, a household was comprised mostly of female relatives\nbesides the wife: a mother, a sister, a grandmother, an aunt; in\ntheir absence a maidservant or an elderly hired free woman did the\nwork;? or the husband would take a second wife soon after the first\nhad died, especially if he had children.\n\nFor the wife the death of her husband was a disaster. She lost her\nsupport and even her domicile and could rely only on the remnants\nof her dowry, her other possessions, and the promised late\nmarriage gift, all of which were often uncertain and insufficient\nassets. Indigent widowhood was a calamity for the woman con-\ncerned and an imposition on the community. It is for this reason\nthat so many Geniza papers contain complaints of widows or\ndescribe actions to improve their lot.\n\nOn the other hand, widowhood or divorce freed a woman from\nthe yoke of marriage. She was now free to act on her own in\nfinancial as well as other matters; for instance, she could marry\nwhom she liked and on conditions she imposed, or could even have\nan affair. But freedom was sweet only if fortified by adequate\nmeans. The well-to-do widow or divorcée was another social figure\nprominent in the Geniza records.\n\nAt marriage a husband mortgaged all his possessions, “even the\ncoat on his shoulders,” and, after his death, his estate, to the\n“debts” he owed his wife: her delayed marriage gift and her dowry,\nthe income of which he had been entitled to use for the duration of\nthe marriage. In reality, this agreement frequently proved to be\nunenforceable simply because the husband was unable to acquire\nthe means for the payments guaranteed. Consequently, when the\nend of life approached, we find settlements made in which the\namount of the late marriage gift to be paid was reduced, sometimes\n\nGoitein, S. D.

This was often done on condition that she remain\nunmarried, at least as long as the children were young and had not\nthemselves married. People from all layers of the society adhered\nto this expression of love and appreciation. An extreme case is that\nof a rich man giving his second wife and the mother of three of his\nchildren (he had a son from a first wife) 200 dinars if she did not\nmarry again, but only 50 dinars (her delayed marriage gift, the\nobligatory payment) if she did.* The poorest of the poor would\nprovide a gift of 1 dinar, or a sack of wheat; a testator with limited\nmeans would release his wife from a modest debt she owed him.® In\nthe middle class gifts of 10 dinars seem to have been considered as\na decent sum, whether the debt owed was 30, 50, or 60 dinars.” But\n“the illustrious doctor, the well-known physician Abu ’l-Mahasin\nSegan ha-Kohanim [“the leader of the Kohens”] b. Abu ’I-Fada'il\nal-Kamukhi,” makes a gift of only 5 dinars in addition to the debt\nof 5 dinars “written in her ketubba”—not all the practitioners of\nthe medical profession got rich. The great emphasis with which, in\nthe document concerned, the dying doctor protected the widow\nfrom any claims on the part of her own sons shows that even that\nmodest gift must have appeared to the latter as exaggerated in view\nof the dire circumstances of the family.®\n\nIn wills to a second wife we find legacies made to a child from a\nprevious marriage, as when the stepson of a merchant receives\n30 dinars.?- Gifts made to the wife in kind, in addition to the\npayments due her, were also usual. A wealthy man gives to his wife\nthe wardrobes in the house, a maid, and a male servant, the latter\nbeing a very exceptional occurrence. The slave was probably the\nmerchant’s agent, who looked after the master’s business during\nhis illness.*\n\nThe terms “I give,” “I will,” were used in deathbed and similar\ndeclarations in an entirely different situation, namely, when the\nhusband left all his possessions to his wife because their total value\nhardly covered what he owed her.

Everything in the house now passed into the possession\nof the legal heir, whether it was a son, a daughter, a brother, a\npaternal cousin of her late husband, or someone else. Her claims\nwere debts against the estate of the deceased, but people often were\ntardy in living up to their commitments, especially toward a\ncreditor in a weak position, like a widow, This attitude toward a\nwidow’s claims is already expressed in an ancient law of the\nIsraelite peasants: “Payments for torts are made with the best field,\nfor debts with that of middle quality, and for the wife’s ketubba,\nwith the worst.””® To counteract the law, the marriage contracts\npreserved in the Geniza normally contain the stipulation that after\nthe termination of the marriage the wife has to be indemnified with\n“good gold dinars of full weight,” that is, with the choicest of her\nformer husband’s possessions. Thus far, I have found only two\ndocuments in which the groom agrees to pay his late marriage gift\nin dinars “of the worst sort”, using the legal term occurring in the\nancient law cited.”® But the attitude persisted, and is even ex-\npressed in wills, where the husband assigns to his wife the price of\nobjects difficult to sell or of limited value, such as household goods\nor books, while objects of more value were available for other\npurposes.®\n\nBefore a widow could get out anything from the heirs she had to\nshow which of her late husband’s possessions were “under her\nhand,” so that these assets could be offset against the heirs’\nobligations. If not otherwise stipulated or agreed upon, she had to\nconfirm this by taking an oath that she was hiding nothing, “the\noath of the widow” so common in the Geniza documents and a\nmost hated affair.

She refused to let them in,\nbut witnessing her grief the visitors asked her not to make any\nchanges and said that they would return later. She then declared\nthat she held nothing of her husband’s possessions. The seemingly\nsuperfluous question, whether she owed “anything,” meaning had\nshe taken the widow'’s oath, probably was occasioned by an\nincomplete or unclear formulation of the “document of trust-\nworthiness.” We have another question about such a document,\nwhich seems to show that uncertainties in these matters were not\nuncommon.*\n\nUncertainty or outright ignorance of the law could have\ndisastrous consequences. A woman had permitted her husband to\ngive as collateral for a debt a house belonging to her personally (not\nbeing a part of her dowry).

She was a woman of\ncircumspection and mercy.*\n\nWhile these arrangements of an experienced merchant sound\nfairly reasonable, although they were perhaps not fully satisfactory\nfor the widow, we are shocked when a man wills that his business\npartner should lock up everything in the house, sell it, and from\nthe price obtained give his wife what he had assigned her.*® Very\nspecial circumstances must have caused a wife, introduced by her\nbrother to the three witnesses present, to agree to the reduction of\nher delayed marriage gift from 70 to 20 dinars, and, on top of that,\nto renounce the title of trustworthiness granted her in the marriage\ncontract. Apparently, she had plundered her husband’s house\nduring his lifetime. Similar accusations, including one against the\nmother-in-law living in the house, are extant, but this woman was\nthe daughter of the prominent notable Abraham b.

In one particularly\ncomplicated and intriguing case, a son frees his mother from her\nwidow’s oath; she was content to receive her delayed marriage gift\nof 30 dinars, while she renounced what was still left of her dowry\nand other dues to the amount of 20 dinars. To a minor son was left\nthe choice of demanding of his mother the widow’s oath upon his\ncoming of age, in which case he would have to pay her one-half of\nthe dowry she had renounced. All seemed settled when rumors\nreached the court that the deceased had left gold unaccounted for.\n‘T'o underline the serious nature of the proceedings the holy Torah\nscroll was taken out of the ark in the presence of the widow and “a\nban in general terms” was pronounced against anyone who might\nhave laid hands on the belongings of the dead man. But the widow\ndid not budge.*\n\nComplaints about heirs who did not pay a widow her dues or did\nnot otherwise come to terms with her are, of course, found in the\nGeniza, but fewer than one would expect.** More common are\nreleases in which the heirs declare that they have no further claims\nagainst the widow and the latter declares that she has received all\nowed her. Many such documents have been preserved. Expressly\nor by implication the releases show that they had been preceded by\nlawsuits, sometimes of long duration.” A trousseau list, written\nwith a thick pen and greyish ink, in which each somewhat faded\nitem is gone over with a fine pen and black ink, looks as if it had\naccompanied such a release, whether for a widow or a divorcée we\ncannot know.*\n\nAfter having been cleared by the heirs and the courts, the widow\nhad to overcome another hurdle: collecting the sums assigned to\nher. Except for the rich a man’s assets consisted mostly of partner-\nships, other forms of investment in business ventures, promissory\nnotes, and the like; and, of course, there were often counterclaims.\nOf the numerous relevant documents, a few characteristic of the\nperiod are briefly described. In a tenth-century letter, probably\nfrom Damascus, fifteen elders admonish a community in another\ncountry to bring to court a merchant against whom a widow held\nno fewer than twenty documents of indebtedness. His claims\nagainst the orphans, offset by counterclaims, had to be dealt with\nseparately.*’ In a letter in Arabic characters connected with this\ncase, the orphans (but in reality the widow speaks) ask a haver to\npronounce a “ban in general terms” against anyone submitting\nfalsified documents to a Muslim judge.*® A similar complaint, that\nthe partners of her late husband had bribed Muslim authorities\nand divided almost the entire estate between themselves, leaving\n\nGoitein, S.

She\nseemed more critical of the Jewish judge of Alexandria “and his\nson,” repeatedly referred to with his father,* than of the qadi,\nwhom she had approached in person at a certain stage of the litiga-\ntion, and who, according to her, declared that the orphans enjoyed\nprecedence.” This letter is perhaps the most detailed account\nfound in the Geniza of the struggle of a widow with the former\npartners of her late husband.*!\n\nHow protracted such litigation could be is evident from an\ninstruction by the Nagid Abraham Maimonides to a provincial\njudge. In a previous note the Nagid had advised him to settle the\naccounts with the debtor and to submit them for examination.\nAfter approval and an order to arrange the payments, still nothing\nhappened, and the widow, the mother of a child, was again forced\nto travel to the capital. This time she carried home with her a\nstrongly worded letter by the Nagid, addressed to both the judge\nand “the holy congregation,” containing quotations like “do not\nwrong any widow or orphan” (Exodus 22:21), or “for their\nredeemer is strong, He will plead their cause against you” (Pro-\nverbs 23:11). Judging from another piece of correspondence of the\nNagid Abraham Maimonides with a local authority one doubts\nwhether even this letter had the desired result.® To conclude this\nsad topic on a happier note: we have a document in which a widow\nappoints an agent to claim merchandise left by her late husband\nwith several merchants who were sojourning “in Yemen.”*® And we\nalso have a bill of release in which a widow confirms having\nreceived all the goods carried for her from that distant country.*\n\nAfter the fight for their basic rights was terminated, a new and\nprotracted struggle began for many, if not most, widows. The\nmajority of widows about whom we read in the legal documents of\nthe Ceniza were mothers of minor children. The courts, in their\nendeavor to preserve the property of the orphans, entrusted it to\nexecutors or administrators, if it had not been done by their father,\nand assigned to the household of the widow alimony of mere\nsubsistence level. But even these scarce means of livelihood were\noften not delivered on time, or in full, or they proved to be totally\ninsufficient. Subsection C,4, below, describes some of those\nhardships.\n\nA widow with adult sons usually lived in the house of one of\nthem. Numerous family letters and legal documents reflect such a\nsituation.

        "text": "viii, G, 3 Widowhood 259\n\nFor widows from a second marriage—an extremely frequent\noccurrence, as will be seen presently—special arrangements had to\nbe made to provide them with a domicile. For well-to-do people\nthis presented no difficulty, since they normally possessed several\nhouses or parts of them. “I also will that my wife should stay in the\nhouse in which I am at present, in one of the apartments which my\nbrother will choose for her, if she wants to live there; but if she\nprefers another place in our compound, my brother will put her\ninto lodgings agreed upon by her and him; and there she will take\nwith her all I willed to her and her son.” This we read in a compre-\nhensive deathbed declaration of a wealthy man with minor sons\nfrom a first marriage.*® Another notable gives to his wife a small\nhouse (overlooking the Khalij, or canal, of Fustat), which was\nadjacent to his own, large one.*” When a man who possessed\nfive eighths of a house gave one eighth to his wife and her son as\nlodgings, “belonging to them forever,” the intention probably was\nto make a gift to the stepson rather than to the wife, for she was\nalso the mother of the donator’s children. For reasons unknown to\nus she might, of course, have preferred to live as widow with her\nson from a first marriage.*®\n\nPoorer people had no such choices. A widower who was about to\nmarry but who had a grown-up son stipulated that his new wife\ncould stay in his house after his death, but that he would not be able\nto provide her with separate “widow’s lodgings,” a privilege\nnormally expected to be granted under such circumstances.®\nGrave conflicts could ensue when the legal situation was not as\nclearly stated as in that document. In a mournful but strong letter\nto a Nagid the widow of a cantor asserts that besides suffering\nbecause of insufficient food and clothing, she and her boy had been\nwithout a permanent domicile for three months, because a son of\nher late husband attacked her physically, and in a dangerous way,\nwhenever she tried to enter the house to which she had a claim. She\nwas writing now because when she cried for help the last time,\nonly a Turk passing by saved her from her stepson, who would\notherwise have killed her. We have, of course, no way of checking\nthese assertions. That they could have been made at all is testimony\nenough to the plight of widows, and so is the conclusion of the\nletter: “If you help me, so good; if not, I trust in God, the exalted,\nand go my way.”®\n\nMost of the women who were forced to have recourse to public\nwelfare were widows. For the term “wife of” in the lists of receivers\nof bread, wheat, clothing, and handouts of money and other\nbenefits described in Med. Soc., 11, 438—469, means “widow of,”\nand most of the single women with children registered in those lists\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The problem is\ntouched upon in section D, below, where the position of women in\ngeneral is discussed. There we consider also the opposite social\nphenomenon, the independent woman with means, widowed or\ndivorced.\n\nDivorce.—\"God hates divorce,” says the Bible (Malachi 2:16), and\none is not surprised to find the Geniza courts trying hard to settle\nmatters between husband and wife before granting them a divorce.\n“Take with you some of the elders, go to her, talk to her heart [an\nuntranslatable biblical phrase], and reason with her, hopefully they\nwill make peace with each other.” Such attempts are found during\nall the phases of the juridical process leading to divorce.** But the\nvery extensive space occupied by these matters in the Geniza docu-\nments proves that divorce was much more common in those times\nand places than in the Jewish families of Europe and America until\nthe last generation. E. J. Worman, the Curator in Oriental Literature\nat the University Library Cambridge was so impressed by this fact\nthat at the beginning of this century he assembled into one collection\nfrom the Geniza forty bills of repudiation, ranging in time from\n1024 through 1279.% But such bills and related material are dis-\npersed in great numbers all over the Geniza. As a matter of fact, the\noldest document found thus far is a note of repudiation, given in\nJerusalem in the year 872/3 by a man from Baghdad to his wife, a\nnative of Nesibin (modern Nisib) in northern Mesopotamia.®\n\nThe wish to separate when a common life becomes unbearable is\na natural human urge. In a society that prohibits or ostracizes\ndivorce, people restrain themselves (or find other solutions). In the\nGeniza world divorce was disapproved, but abundantly practiced.\nSeveral reasons seem to account for it. The example of the\nsurrounding Muslim environment no doubt was a strong factor.\nThe Copts, an ancient and enduring Christian community, practice\ndivorce, even though it is banned by the Church. Egypt, their\ncountry, had become thoroughly Muslim, and the mores of a\nmajority exercise an overwhelming influence.®\n\nFirst marriages we remember, were normally arranged by the\nparents or other relatives to form an additional link in the connec-\n\nGoitein, S.

The matter ended up in separation [from his wife],\nbut God provided the girl with a replacement better in every\nrespect: religiosity, means, and scholarship; these days she is\nentering her new house.” A note to a judge, signed yeshii‘a,\n“salvation,” the motto of the Gaon and nasi Daniel b. Azarya,\nstrikes a similar note: “Mufrij b. Sulayman appeared before me and\ncomplained that a brother-in-law of his treated him with contempt.\nThe wife also does not like the husband [This, it seems, was a matter\nof sccondary consideration]. They [brother and sister] have\ndecided to separate from him. You, our master—may God\nstrengthen your honored position—are best fit to summon the\nparties and to settle the matter in a way conducive to the welfare of\nall concerned.”® In an unusual letter to her husband away on\ntravel a wife expresses her yearnings for him and wishes to be\nunited with him in health and happiness, but reveals to him that his\nparents and his brother urge her “to release” him. The manuscript\nbreaks off with, the words: “Now, if I divorce you. ...”*\n\nIn view of such occurrences one wonders what happened to\nthose “diplomatic” marriages arranged by eminent professionals\nand business people.”™ To restore peace between the two yeshivas\nof Baghdad, Hay Gaon, the leading figure in the Jewish ecumene\nduring the first third of the eleventh century, married the\ndaughter of Samuel b. Hofni, head of the other yeshiva. But after\nthe latter’s demise, relations between Hay and his brother-in-law\nbecame extremely strained, a situation that caused bewilderment\neven in faraway Qayrawan, Tunisia. How the woman placed\nbetween these two men faired is not reported.” David b. Daniel b.\nAzarya, for some time head of the Jews in the Fatimid empire,\nrepudiated the girl betrothed to him, although it was his father-in-\nlaw who had procured for him, a stranger in Egypt, the means\nneeded for his success.

Young men of all walks of life\noften had to leave their wives for months and years, and wives\nusually were not prepared to follow them to foreign ports. The\nsubject is extensively treated in the subsections on the absent and\nrunaway husband, above.” Here, a few examples of bills of\nrepudiation sent from one country or locality to another underline\nthe fact that separation caused by travel was apt to lead to divorce.\nIn a lengthy letter, mostly in rhymed prose, Joseph ha-Kohen b.\nSolomon Gaon, writing from Jerusalern or Ramle, informs the\nJewish chief justice of Aleppo that it had taken seven months to\nfind the husband whose wife in the Syrian city had demanded a\ndivorce; the bill had now been made out and entrusted to a man\nwho would deliver it to the woman.” A husband from Fustat, while\nin Aleppo, divorced his wife, who had remained in the Egyptian\ncapital; we have both the court record dealing with the case and the\nactual bill of repudiation.” When the freedwoman Dhahab\n(“Gold”) received the bill of repudiation sent to Fustat from a pro-\nvincial town, the official dealing with the matter found it necessary\nto ask the Nagid for further instructions.™\n\nMobility had another negative effect: it resulted in marriages,\nprobably often hastily concluded, between persons from different\nplaces who were not compatible.” The 872/3 bill of repudiation\nfrom Jerusalem already mentioned, the most ancient one found\nthus far, reflects such a situation. In a bill from Fustat a woman is\nrepudiated by her Alexandrian husband in the small town of\nTatay, renowned as a holy shrine (Feb. 1052).%° An immigrant\nfrom Yemen, who had married a woman in Bilbays, Lower Egypt,\ndivorced her in Jerusalem, “after much suffering and paying her\nmore than was due her” (ca. 1214).% A man from Jabal Nafuasa, a\nmountainous district southwest of Tripoli, Libya, repudiated a\n“Maghrebi” woman, probably from Tunisia, in Fustat (Dec.\n1214).5* A marriage between a husband from Ascalon, Palestine,\nand a woman from Alexandria, Egypt, was terminated in Fustat in\n1223/4.% A woman from the Egyptian capital, married to a native\n\nGoitein, S.

Had all clerks adhered to the custom\nof noting the parties’ countries of origin, the dangerous effects of\nmobility on marital life would have become even more patent in the\nrelevant documents.\n\nFinally, a contributing factor to the frequency of divorces in the\nGeniza period might have been the greater attentiveness to a wife’s\nsufferings, to be expected in a cosmopolitan bourgeois society,\ncoupled with the notorious Mediterranean sensitivity to “what\npeople say.” A bad marriage was a disgrace, because such matters\nnever remained a secret for long.

Ancient Near\nEastern (and Jewish) law knew more humane forms of separation.\nThe Aramaic marriage contracts of the Jewish community of\nElephantine, southern Egypt, written in the fifth century B.C.,\nprovide the wife with power to initiate divorce proceedings similar\nto that of the husband.

The\ncourts could coerce him, but if he remained obstinate, or could not\nbe found, the wife was condemned to the life of “a widow whose\nhusband was alive,” which was worse than that of a widow, for she\ncould never marry again.

At least three men acted, two serving as\nwitnesses and one as the actual deliverer. The official document\ndescribes the three as entering the hall of the house of the woman\nconcerned, while she was sitting in an adjacent cabinet;* the proxy\nof the husband entered the room and put the bill into her hand\nwhile the two others looked on.” The letter describes four persons,\nincluding a havér, or divine, waiting on the landing of a staircase\nbehind a door; the wife opened the door, and the writer put the bill\ninto her hand, but took it back in order to keep it In a safe place.®®\nThe same meticulous attention to detail was observed when the\nhusband was present at the delivery.®®\n\nThe acceptance of the bill of repudiation by the wife was\nseemingly a mere formality.

If unable to\ndo so, he would give her half his daily earnings. He was not\npermitted to leave Alexandria for four years. For the rest of his life\nhe could not retake his first wife, who lived somewhere out in the\ncountry. His clothes were sold, and their price, 137 dirhems, given\nto the wife. If he failed to keep any of these stipulations, he would\nbe excommunicated. The court record states expressly that this was\na settlement “agreed upon by the two after long discussions and\ndisputes,” not a court decision imposed on the parties. One can\nhardly fail to see here a strong woman in action (her name was\nSitt al-Kull, “Mistress over All”); after living with her, the husband\nfelt that his first divorcée had not been so bad a wife after all, and,\ntherefore, was forced to vow not to marry her again.'*\n\nJekuthiel b.

She claimed that he still owed her money due\nfrom her marriage contract as well as some silver jewelry, and he\nasserted that she kept some of his belongings. Muna produced\nsome clothing and household goods in court and declared that that\nwas all she had. “The Doctor,” not satisfied, demanded that she\nswear the obligatory oath of the divorcée. The judge warned and\nintimidated her, as was usual in such cases; the bier and the\ntrumpets (actually: ram horns) were brought in to remind her of\ndeath and the Last Judgment, but Muna remained adamant: “I\nswear.” Finally, worthy elders intervened, to avert the ominous\nevent of a false cath. “The Doctor” agreed to pay 75 dinars and\nboth parties renounced their claims. The repudiation procedures\nfollowed immediately. Jekuthiel asked the judge (none other than\nAbraham b. Isaac the Scholar, see Med. Soc. I1, 512, sec. 10) to write\nthe bill—a short piece of about thirteen lines or less—and Eli b.\nYahya, the parnas, or welfare official, to serve, together with\nsomeone else, as witnesses for its delivery. All acceded to these\nrequests. Muna received the bill from Eli’s hands and produced her\nmarriage contract. During all these procedures, Jekuthiel was\nsitting in the courtroom.

The Geniza texts and contemporary sources\nuse an Islamic legal term for this procedure: iftida’, “ransoming\nherself,” getting herself free by monetary sacrifices (Koran, 2:229).\nIn my review of the edition of Maimonides’ Responsa I warned that\nthe use of Arabic terms does not prove the borrowing of Muslim\ninstitutions. For what could non-Muslims writing Arabic do but use\nArabic terms?'®® ‘The entire question has now been taken up by\nM. A. Friedman in a solid study, which shows that, according to\nestablished Jewish statute, a wife, as mdredet, “revolting” against her\nhusband’s rule, could initiate a divorce by renouncing her delayed\nmarriage gift, whereupon the husband would be forced by the\ncourts to accede to repudiation. Most likely, both the Arabic and\nJewish practices are compromises between an ancient Near Eastern\ntradition which gave the wife the right to separation on the one\nhand and the principle of unilateral repudiation by the husband on\nthe other.’\n\nThe financial arrangements at a divorce were of the widest\npossible variety, and many documents describing them have been\npreserved. A wife initiating the divorce would usually not forego all\nher rights, but only some of them, or would permit payment in\ninstallments (sometimes insured by guarantors).\"® This permission\nwas not easily approved by the authorities, for experience had\ntaught them that a man in that situation and eager to marry\nanother wife was often not punctual in fulfilling his obligations\ntoward the first. This evil, too, is illustrated by numerous docu-\nments. Two examples: A detailed list of receipts shows that in the\ncourse of two years and five months a divorcée had received 3 1/2\ninstead of 10 dinars. In another fragmentary court record, the wife\nis promised 3 dinars per month, but the reverse side shows only\none payment of half a dinar.\"\"* When a husband claimed that his\nwife, a former widow, had infected him with her illness about\nwhich he had not known before the marriage, and that, in view of\nhis state of health and poverty, he asked either to be freed of the\npayment of the late marriage gift altogether, or to be permitted\nto do it in installments, one suspects that there was no great\ndifference between the two alternatives.

His wife, the daughter of another tax\nfarmer, must have been married for a long time, for she had a\ngrown-up son, and had come to the capital with a boy of seven in\norder to give him a good education. In her petition to the Nagid\nshe expresses the apprehension that her husband would take the\nboy away from her and marry another wife without paying her her\ndues. She later came to see the Nagid in person and produced a\ncourt record showing that her late marriage gift had not yet been\npaid. The Nagid acted, sending warnings that no local official\nshould marry that man before he had absolved himself of his\nobligations toward his first wife. He also wrote one or several\npersonal letters to the Jewish judge of al-Mahalla where the tax\nfarmer was supposed to marry, and summoned the culprit to the\nNagid’s court to determine if he would deny the charges of his\nwife. But that judge, as we learn from the third letter in this matter,\nhad not reacted to the several reminders, and we are left in the\ndark as to how the affair ended.”®\n\nThese examples show that then, as now, divorce actions were\nprotracted affairs.

She would put into the new contract: “Whenever he\nspeaks to me about divorce, he must pay me a fine of 50 dinars\n[a sum this woman certainly had never held in her hands], whereas\nI shall never impede him from marrying again, and if I do so, my\nlate marriage gift will be reduced from 20 to 5 dinars.” One sees\nhow the two spouses intimidated each other before the abortive\ndivorce.'*®\n\nOne would like to know something about the duration of a\nmarriage ending in divorce. Naturally, there were traumatic\nexperiences, causing a girl to run away a month or so after the\nwedding and adamandy refusing to return to her husband.*®\nSomething of this sort might have happened when a man traveling\nfrom Alexandria to Cairo and south writes home: “I received a\nletter from which I learn that Harian (Aaron) has divorced Yumn\n(“Good Luck”).

Contracts where the bride agrees to bring up the groom’s\nchildren or vice versa, or where both parties provide for their off~\nspring from a previous marriage, are frequently found in the\nGeniza. They are discussed in the subsection on the lot of orphans\n(C, 4, below).\n\nThe number of widowed or divorced fathers marrying a second\ntime must have been infinitely larger than that of mothers. This\nseems to be proved by the fact that we have next to no references to\nfathers making, or trying to make, arrangements for their orphans\n(except remarriage, as just noted), while the Geniza is replete with\nreports about unmarried widows or divorcées having children.\nThis contrast is understandable since a busy man normally is not\nfree to deal with small children; a single woman forms a household,\na single man does not; the “house-husband” had not yet been\ninvented. True, on travel, the merchants had to look after them-\nselves and do the cooking. But at home, when no wife, or daughter,\nor another female was around, one complained: “I have no one to\nhand me a cup of water.”\"*\n\nBeing married was the normal state of an adult. Marrying again\nafter a previous marriage had been terminated was therefore the\nnatural thing to do. Single fathers with children, we have asserted,\nwere far less numerous than single mothers.

She stayed in bed for three months, did not go to any\nwedding or other party, visited the bathhouse only once a month\n(instead of every week), and when her father suggested she marry\nanother man, she refused, “so that ke will be punished for my sins\nin the world to come.” (A husband was responsible for his wife’s\nconduct toward God; he was, for instance, entitled and, under\ncircumstances, even urged, to annul her vows.) This looks like a\nmedieval form of expression toward a relationship not unknown to\ncontemporary divorcées.'*®\n\nRegard for the children’s welfare has been noted as a main\nreason for a second marriage. The same consideration could have\nthe opposite effect, namely, that a mother alone preferred not to\nremarry in order to dedicate herself exclusively to the upbringing\nof her little ones. I vividly remember a young widow of perfect\nbeauty from a Yemenite weavers’ village, a real Aower of the fields,\nwho declined all suggestions for a second marriage because of her\nchildren. When I visited the village twenty years later, she was still\nsingle; the baby in the house was a grandchild. That similar\nattitudes prevailed in Geniza times is proved by the great number\nof single women with children mentioned in the documents. While\nmany of these women simply might not have found a husband\nwilling to take care of another man’s offspring, others might have\nbeen motivated by regard for their children. The opposite,\nmarrying without sufficient safeguard for the children, was\ndisapproved. Two letters, emanating from the same pen, tell about\na widow with children intending to marry a person who obviously\nhad not too good a reputation. The judge warned her: “You will be\nhis slave.” She replied: “I wish to be his slave.” The writer reporting\nthis summarizes thus: “She has set her mind on marrying and has\nforsaken her children.”**! ’\n\nThe legal impediment to remarriage, that no one could enter a\nnew union before being cleared by a release from the previous\n\nGoitein, S.

When a widow wished to marry, her son had to free\nher from the widow’s oath, if that had not been done before.'??\n\nJewish (and Eastern Christian) law prohibited a woman who had\nillicit relations with another man from marrying him (or to remain\nwith her husband). We hear very little about such matters in the\nGeniza.”® [llicit relations of a man with a maidservant and the\nsubsequent problem of marrying her were more common.'®'\n\nThe popular belief that a woman widowed twice was “a killer”\nand should therefore not be permitted to marry a third time is\nmentioned in the Talmud and was adhered to by some judges in\nthe Geniza period, much to the objection of Maimonides, especially\nwith respect to a younger woman, even if she was widowed more\nthan twice. To soothe the scruples of those who were apprehen-\nsive of contravening the authority of the Talmud, Maimonides\nrecommended the practice commonly accepted in Spain, following\nthe Jewish authorities there: the couple should marry outside the\ncourt in the presence of only two witnesses, and then report to a\njudge, who would legalize the union post factum and arrange for\nthe religious ceremony.'*\n\nA considerable number of second marriages listed in the Geniza\ndocuments seem to be contracts between two aged persons who de-\ncided to form a common household. She brings in little and he gives\nand promises even less. These were probably people doing some\nwork, as much as they could find and were able to do, or lived on\npublic charity, or both. But this interpretation, like the question of\npoverty in the Geniza in general, needs further study.\n\nNo difference in the professed main aim of marriage, the\nprocreation of offspring, is discernible between first and second\nmarriages. The Geniza tells us about husbands who sired more\nchildren in their second than in their first marriage, and vice versa.\nIt all depended, of course, on the circumstances, such as the age of’\nthe spouses and the respective duration of the two unions.\"*\n\nThe same is to be said about compatibility.

This indeed shows that an attempt in this\ndirection was made by the new ruler, who needed funds for his\nincessant wars. A Geniza fragment from this time describing an\nattempt to retrieve the estate of the orphans of a katib, or govern-\nment official, from al-diwan al-salihi (Saladin’s administration)\nseems to refer to such a situation.* Saladin consulted the doctors of\nMuslim law, who confirmed that the demand of their Jewish\ncounterparts was justified. Whatever Saladin ruled in that matter,\nthe examples reported in Med. Soc., 11, 396, prove that shortly after\nhis death the Muslim authorities acted in a rather high-handed\nmanner with regard to Jewish estates. From that time on, as is well\nknown from literary sources, in this, as in other respects, the\nsituation of the minority groups deteriorated steadily.®\n\nBefore trying to show how the authorities speaking to us through\nthe Geniza documents handled the claims of heirs, some special\ncases of inheritance must be considered. According to Jewish law a\nhusband inherited from his wife, but not vice versa.® We hear\nsurprisingly little about this. Probably, agreements made at the\nwedding, or later in life, took care of the wife’s succession.”\nThe natural thing for a husband to do was to turn over his wife's\nestate to their common children. Elazar b. Elazar of Damascus gave\nclothing, bedding, and copper, as well as a maidservant, inherited\nfrom his wife Fakhr (“Glory”), the daughter of a cook, to his two\ndaughters Hasab (“Distinction”) and Kifa’ (“Reward”) in equal\nshares. The division of the items was made by lot, handled by a\nservant of the court, under the supervision of two judges (Fustal,\n1182). A share (besides the maid) amounted to only 11 1/8 dinars.\nThus, these were poor people; the late Fakhr possessed no jewelry;\nwe should not suspect Elazar of keeping the gold and silver for\nhimself ®\n\nFor a similar case (even in the names), but on a higher social\nlevel, we turn to a document written in Qus, Upper Egypt, in 1216.\nThe physician Abii Mansir Elazar b.

Even more far-reaching was\nthe case of Mansir b. Mukhtiar (“Victor” son of “The Chosen”),\nwho appeared in court in January 1046 with his boy and made him\na gift of the entire estate of his wife Dhukur (“Treasure”). Having\ndone so, he claimed from his brother-in-law, a banker, all she had\nleft with him, particularly 100 dinars that she had allegedly given\nhim for repair of the family mansion. If retrieved, these sums\nwould be administered by the court as the guardian of minor\norphans. Incidentally, these two examples show again that a wife\nwas supposed to keep possessions over which she had the right of\ndisposition with members of her own family.™\n\nIt is characteristic of a period of transition, like that of the\nGeniza, that ancient laws and notions continue to exercise their\nforce as new ideas come to the fore.

From the\ntenth through the beginning of the thirteenth century these\nmatters are handled as though no outside interference was antici-\npated.

In 1028, a woman in Fustat is declared the sole\nheir of her father who had died in Acre (Akko), Palestine; in 1031,\na woman in Damascus acknowledges receipt of her father’s estate;\nin 1050 another one receives all the rights to the estate of a relative\nin Aleppo, Syria, a maternal cousin of her father, since her father\nwas the sole heir of that cousin and she, of her father.'\" At\napproximately the same time Qurra (“Delight of the Eyes”)\nb.

Her stepmother would receive\n15 dinars due her from her marriage contract.

Samuel, the partner,\nfor 350 dinars still owed to her father. The relevant document was\nsent from Tunisia to Tyre, Lebanon, where the Gaon Elijah had\nvalidated it shortly before his death (1083). But the matter came\nbefore the rival court of the nasi David b.

If\nthey were unmarried or minor, the father earmarked fixed sums\nfor their outfits, or left the action to his wife, or a son. The heir was\nobliged to see to it that the orphaned girls were married in\naccordance with their station. The courts, the guardians of the\norphans, watched over the fulfillment of this obligation.\n\nNo fewer than four court records, all written in the course of\nsix weeks in the spring of 1156, deal with a single case of orphan\ngirls. Aba Zikri Judah Kohen, the noted India trader and repre-\nsentative of merchants in the Egyptian capital, left a son, Sulayman,\nfrom an earlier marriage, and two minor daughters from his\nsecond wife, the daughter of a katib, or government official. He\nassigned to each of the girls 200 dinars as their dowry and\n50 dinars, with which a share in a house should be acquired. Until\ntheir marriage, the two together were to receive a monthly\nallowance of 2 dinars.\n\nThe court acted immediately. As long as the immovables were\nnot acquired, Sulayman volunteered to add another half dinar to\nthe moathly allowances (which shows, by the way, that an invest-\nment of 100 dinars in a house was assumed to bring 6 dinars as\nyearly rent). He undertook to give the girls their dowries not\n“at marriage” (as the will obviously had stated), but as soon as they\ncame of age “according to Muslim law, so that they were able to\nrelease him in a legally valid fashion.” If, however, the mother\napplied to a Muslim court, or to another government authority, or\nused her influence with persons in power to exercise pressure on\nhim, the gitt would be void. As collateral, Sulayman had to deposit\nwith the court the deeds of his house, as well as those for a quarter\nof another house he possessed. Shortly thereafter the mother\nacknowledges the receipt of the allowances. Finally, about six weeks\nafter the first action recorded, the purchase of a property for one\nof the girls, one eighth ot a house worth 50 dinars “on the little\nMarket of the Vizier in the Street of the Wine Sellers,” was\ncompleted to the satisfaction of the court. Despite the great care for\nthe girls, a patriarchal social system, conveying the father’s absolute\nhold on the family purse to the son, is manifest.”®\n\nIn the case just discussed the father had ordered that immov-\nables be acquired for his daughters. In a similar situation, a brother\nin the small town of Sahrajt declares in court that although the\nancient law required that “a daughter maintained by her brothers\nreceive one tenth of the family immovables . . . in our time” she\nmay be indemnified with money. He, however, would give his two\nsisters a house. Incidentally, one sees again that landed property\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In one magnificent Hebrew document written in\nOctober 1006, the father also empowers the elder son to give his\nyounger brother his share in the estate only when he, the execu-\ntor—not the courts—was satisfied that the boy was ready for the\nresponsibility.*\n\nThe discriminatory treatment of daughters in matters of\ninheritance was imposed by an ancient law and seems to have been\nat variance with the egalitarian trends of the Geniza period. Yet\nthat preferential attitude toward males had its place in that society,\ninasmuch as the majority of females were either minors and\nteenagers, who were in need of a guardian, or married women,\nwho again had a special status, having received their fair share, and\noften more than that, in what their fathers were able to provide. In\nany case, inheritance was a strong factor, negative and positive, in\ndefining the place of women in Geniza society.\n\nThe actions of the courts and other agencies with regard to the\nadministration of estates and their proper distribution were largely\nconditioned by the very nature of things, and, consequently, in\nmany respects, probably were not essentially different from what\nhappens in other societies that have a mercantile economy and\npossess a fairly well-organized juridical system. Since the super-\nvision of succession was one of the main concerns of the Jewish\ncourts, the Geniza material about this topic is extensive.

Moses, judge in the town of Sunbat,\nwho derived most of his livelihood from his drugstore, died in\nOctober 1150, two inventories were made, one of his very extensive\nlibrary and another of his not so richly studded storeroom.** There\nis the letter of an heir addressed to the dayyan Hiyya (b. Isaac)\ninforming him that “because of the rumors” (presumably, that he\nintended to get the better of other heirs) the writer locked his\nplace, awaiting the judge’s instructions.*\n\nThe widow’s mandatory declaration, or oath, that she did not\nhold any of the belongings of her husband, was another measure of\nprecaution. It was matched by the confirmation of the heirs which\nreleased her from all claims in this respect.*\n\nThese measures were only the first step in the endeavors of the\nauthorities to preserve an estate for its legal heirs and legatees.\nUsually, not all of a man’s possessions were kept in his house, and,\noften, they were not fully or properly listed. Attention has been\ndrawn before to the aversion of Mediterranean people to count\nexactly what they have.”\n\nA common device of the courts was the promulgation of “a ban\nin general terms” against anyone who held possessions of a\ndeceased person without returning them, or who failed to report\nany knowledge of them. A letter from Alexandria, written around\n1080, says that every Monday and Thursday following the death of\na person the local Jewish judge pronounced a ban against anyone\nwho knew of a document or an account book noting the assets of\nthe deceased, or of things he had deposited with anyone. It was to\nno avail, and neither was a similar “warning” issued by a judge of\nal-Mahalla to return books (it seems of a bookseller) for the benetit\nof orphans.*\n\nSince business was international, a ban was not confined to one\nplace or country. A ban on behalf of a merchant who had died in\nEgypt was proclaimed in all provincial towns of Palestine, and in\nJerusalem on the peak day of the pilgrimage to the Holy City, when\nthe highest degree of publicity was available (ca. 1060).* While in\nthese and other instances from the eleventh and twelfth centuries\nthis expedient of the ban was applied only when warranted by the\ncircumstances, by the thirteenth century it had become almost\nmandatory. When, in December 1258, an official was sent by the\nNagid David b. Abraham Maimonides to Damira, a town in Lower\nEgypt, to settle a matter of inheritance, he first assembled ten\npersons “at least” in the house of a local notable, a government\nofficial, and pronounced a ban against “any Jewish person, male or\n\nGoitein, S.

The business at\nhand was its distribution. One of the three sons of the dead man\nwas a minor. The boys already of age could have freed their\nmother, or, rather, stepmother, from the oath of the widow, so that\nshe could receive what was due her from her marriage contract; a\nminor could not. But before imposing that loathsome oath, the\nofficial preferred to consult the Nagid.*\n\nEstates, like marriage gifts and dowries, prices of houses, and\noften even amounits of loans, were estimated in gold, the specie of\nconstant value.\" The Damira inheritance, just discussed, consisted\nof 1,500 dirhems, partly pure silver, nugra, partly alloyed silver,\nwarag, wares, implements, and household goods. It was estimated\nas being worth a total of 94 dinars at the exchange rate of 1:40\n(dinar: waraq).* One hundred and fifty years earlier, in July 1108,\nthe small and modest family of a seller of potions valued the\ninventory of his store, along with 169 dirhems in cash found there,\nat 11 1/2 dinars; this estimate was necessary, for half that sum was\ndue a minor brother; years would pass before he came of age; by\nthen the price of the silver specie might have undergone a marked\nchange.*® Again, about a hundred years earlier, in summer 1007, a\nsum of 164 dinars and 10 qirats, representing the value of the\nestate left by the scholar Jacob Résh Kalla b. Joseph b. Isaiah,** was\nsent from Damascus to Fustat and delivered to his son Joseph who\nhad come of age and lived in the Egyptian capital. The document\nstates that the father had left things with several persons and\nemphasizes twice that the sum had been brought together,\nobviously by the executor Moses b. Shahryar, “from various\nsources,” or “under different titles.” Similar cases, where estates\nwere valued in gold coins, or actually converted into that specie, are\nfound throughout the centuries. In one case this was done even\nwith regard to a new house, left by an aunt to two nephews, one of\nwhom was a minor. I understand this custom prevailed in England\nwell into the nineteenth century. When James Smithson, the father\nof the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., died (1829),\nhis estate reached this country in the form of 105 bags each\ncontaining 1,000 gold sovereigns.*\n\nToday, accession to one’s inheritance is a wearisome legal\nprocess. In Geniza times, the matter seems to have been different.\nWhen an inheritance was not contested, or otherwise problematic,\n\nGoitein, S. D.

At least, I have not\nread anything to the contrary—not even about an inheritance tax.*\nOne should not argue that our documents had no reason to make\nmention of them because these taxes were collected by the Muslim\ngovernment. The poll tax, too, was levied by government agencies,\nyet the Geniza is replete with information about it. The inter-\nvention of the qadi was dreaded so much because once he had laid\nhis hands on an estate, it was difficult to get it away from him. He\nwould take from the substance of the estate under whatever legal\npretext he could find, and there were, of course, the various tips\nand bribes routinely expected. Even with regard to the highly\nrespected Alexandrian qadi al-Makin (Makin al-Dawla, died 1134\nafter a prolonged incumbency) the intervention of the Nagid\nMevorakh b. Saadya was repeatedly sought to retrieve estates held\nby him.*” But we do not read about inheritance taxes on non-\nMuslims, which certainly would have been accompanied by\nadditional extortions had they existed in the period considered. In\nany case, the Jewish authorities certainly had no right to impose an\ninheritance tax, and thus had no reason to interfere in the process\nof succession, unless it was made necessary by specific circum-\nstances.\n\nWhen an inheritance was contested, the courts had first to find\nout who the legal heirs were. Since such cases usually were com-\nplicated, and, we have only one, mostly incomplete, document\nabout each action, not much can be learned. In one fragment, a\nman who died a martyr’s death during the Crusaders’ siege of Acre\n(Akko, 1104) had one heir who had drowned in the Indian Ocean,\nand a sister who was, or had been, married to the claimant who\nappeared in court. Declarations about sole heirs are common.*®\nFour generations of males and females related by ramified family\nconnections appear in one document and five in another.” In a\nrecord concerning two sisters and two brothers one sister was\nmarried to the paternal uncle of a claimant. After she and her\nhusband had died, each of their two daughters retained\n1,000 dinars from the estate of their parents, giving the rest to their\nmaternal aunt. With this, the latter married a man who had sons\nfrom a previous marriage, to whom he allegedly owed money. He\nstipulated that they should get what he received from that aunt at\ntheir marriage. But he died first, and she gave her belongings to\none of her two brothers. This one had no children, but wished to\nleave his possessions to the sons of his dead brother.

Samuel,\nthe trader mentioned before, advising him that in case he died, one\nthird should be given to his son, another to his brother’s children,\nand a third (lost).

Ibn al-Maqdisi gave\nhis attorney as a symbolic gift “the threshold of his house in the\nTujib quarter of Fustat, known as the domicile of his father” and\n“together with it” conveyed to him a long list of rights to act as his\nsubstitute, including the one to sell on the spot everything he\nretrieved, movables and real estate (April 1215).%°\n\nIn a court record written about a century earlier (spring 1116)\nwe see how the authorities acted after receipt of a power of\nattorney.

He had already confirmed the\nfirst, the price of the personal belongings of the dead man,\n4 dinars, 2 qirats, less 1 habba (1/74th of a dinar), but the relevant\ndocument had been lost. The second sum, 6 1/2 dinars and\n| qirat, was the price of dried spikenard. Now, receipt for the two\nremittances was made out, and, accordingly, the carrier of both, a\nMr. Small (of the noted Ben Saghir family), was released from any\nresponsibility for the sums carried.®* In a Cairene court under the\nauthority of Samuel ha-Nagid (1140—1159) two brothers confirm\naaving received from a maternal uncle, the physician Elazar\nha-Levi, 12 1/2 dinars, representing the price of a maidservant left\nto them by another maternal uncle.*\n\nA document illustrating a single phase in an inheritance lawsuit\nmay prove revealing. In a Judaeo-Persian court record from\nJuly 951 (the oldest clearly dated document known so far in that\nlanguage) one Samuel sued his two brothers for a share in their\nuncle’s estate. The brothers retorted that Samuel owed the uncle\nmoney. Before dealing with the matter, the Karaite court ordered\nthe two parties to take an oath that they would not apply to any\nother authority (which probably meant not only the qadi but also\nthe rabbinical court). That being done, an account book of the\ndead uncle was produced, but it failed to supply clear evidence.\nFinally, Samuel agreed to grant his brothers three months to study\nall the account books of their uncle to prove their case.

According to a\nwell-known principle of Islamic law, “the adherents of different\nreligions do not inherit from one another,” but the Fatimids were\nShi‘ites who gave neo-Muslims special rights to the estates of their\nnon-Muslim relatives. They ruled: A Muslim inherits from an\n“infidel,” but an infidel cannot inherit from a “believer.” This legal\nsituation might be reflected in two Geniza records, both from the\nmiddle of the twelfth century. When ‘Ammar b. Makhlaf of\nDamietta, the Mediterranean seaport, was sued by a neo-Muslim\nrelative in a mauter of inheritance, he promised to pay him\n20 dinars, if he forced another relative, Abu ’l-Mufaddal, son of the\nhavér Perahya, and himself styled “Delight of the Yeshiva, Head of\nthe Munificent,” to give an oath concerning the same sum. Abu\n’I-Mufaddal swore, but ‘Ammar was imprisoned for some time in\nconnection with this affair. The record concerned deals with a side\nissue. ‘Ammar in public withdrew his accusation that it was\nAbu ’I-Mufaddal who had caused his imprisonment and otherwise\nharmed him.%®\n\nOur second document is an account by a trustee of the court, and\nwe must try to reconstruct the story behind it from the data\nprovided. A poor widow had died, leaving her sister 164 dirhems\nwith the provision to pay the expenses for her burial from this sum\nand to take the rest for herself. No doubt, her personal belongings\nwere also bequeathed to the sister. But hardly had that old woman\nclosed her eyes, when her “renegade” sons laid claim to her\ninheritance.

Finally, a total of 104 dirhems was agreed upon for the\nburial. Then the text continues: “For the bribe for the qadi—10\ndirhems; consideration for Aba Muhammad (the qadi’s servant)—\n1 1/2 dirhems.” These sums were delivered to the servant in the\npresence of three persons listed by name. Subsequently, and again\nin the presence of three witnesses, 40 dirhems were given to the\n“renegades” in the way of an agreement, 6 to the (Muslim)\nattorney, 2 to the official messenger of the qadi, and 5 to another\nqadi who drew up the relevant document. This left an overdraft of\n4 1/2 dirhems, which the trustee paid out of his own pocket. I\nassumed that personal belongings, too, had been bequeathed\nbecause if the “renegades” took everything left after the various\nMuslim officials were compensated, there was no point in speaking\nabout an agreement.”™\n\nA peaceful settlement, sulha, reached after long negotiations,\nconcludes this subsection on inheritance. The central figure in this\nlawsuit was a grandmother, called Sitt al-Kuutab, “The Queen of\nthe Scribes,” who had, besides an adult grandson from a married\ndaughter, minor grandchildren from two sons who were under the\ntutelage of three guardians, after their fathers had died. Sitt\nal-Kuttab’s husband had died some time before, bequeathing a\nhouse plus 100 dinars to his daughter. He owed his wife 100 dinars\nfrom her marriage contract and, in his last will, had presented her\nwith two clasps with pearls. At his death the guardians of the\nchildren of her sons laid their hands on all he left. Her daughter\nappointed her son (not her husband, probably from a second\nmarriage) as her attorney, but seemingly without much success.\nThen, as the record states, “The widow Sitt al-Kuttab arranged this\npeace after she said to us [the court] many times: You cannot get a\nsettlement from me unless you first settle with my daughter.” On\none day the daughter received the deed of the house while the\nguardians agreed to register it as her property with both Jewish\nand Muslim authorities; on the next day the gold was brought in,\nwhereupon the daughter released the guardians from any further\nobligation. Finally, Sitt al-Kuttib received her clasps and 60 dinars,\nthe remaining 40 to be paid later; her marriage contract was torn\nup as a token that everything was settled. She was solemnly\nreleased from the oath of the widow and all other obligations\ntoward the heirs.

As the\nhonorific name of the grandmother indicates, she probably came\nfrom a family of government officials.”\n\nIn many, if not most, of the cases of succession described in the\npreceding pages, orphaned minor heirs were involved. In the\nfollowing, we learn about the specific conditions affecting the lives\nof orphans.\n\nThe administration of the possessions of orphans—“The judge is the\nfather of the orphans.”” This Talmudic maxim,” cited in our\ndocuments in various forms, explains why the Geniza is replete\nwith material about fatherless children.™ How far this role of the\ncourts was effective and beneficial might be gleaned from the\nforthcoming examples selected for illustration.\n\nIn addition to the actions taken for the protection of any heir\n(see the preceding subsection) the first duty of the judge was the\nappointment of an executor or executors for the minors, unless it\nhad already been done by their fathers. A classic case is repre-\nsented in a detailed and complete Hebrew court record from\nspring 1026, fortunately complemented by a document in Arabic,\nwritten thirteen months later. The Hebrew record concerns a\nminor, four years old, the Arabic document his elder siblings who\nhad come of age but were not yet able to take care of their finan-\ncial affairs. The court did not act of its own initiative. Yeshua b.\nSedaqa (possibly the orphans’ maternal grandfather, see below)\n“and others” remonstrated against the inactivity of the authorities\nand demanded the appointment of a guardian, since the orphans’\nfather had died intestate. In the Arabic document the minor’s\nsiblings appoint their maternal uncle Joseph b. Yeshaa (see above)\nas their representative (July 1027). But with regard to the minor\n“the judge and the elders” acted differently. They appointed Eli b.\nJapheth, “known as Bar ‘Adi,” but not otherwise described, as\nguardian, with the banker Solomon b. Saadya Ibn Saghir (“Mr.\nSmall”) as his supervisor. The assets collected were to be deposited\nwith the latter and he and the judge had to approve any payments\nto be made from the orphan’s estate.”\n\nA similar procedure, namely, the appointment of a supervisor\n(also 2 member of the Ibn Saghir family) over a representative in\nmatters of succession, has been noted in a document written\nthirty-one years later, in 1057.7 A responsum by the nasi Daniel b.\nAzarya (Gaon 1051-1063) makes mention of a judge who had\nappointed two guardians to be directed by two supervisors with\nwhom the sums collected were ordered to be deposited.

Daniel states, first, that no judge can devolve his own respon-\nsibility of supervision on anyone else and, second, that he was not\nsatisfied that the supervisor had displayed the measure of pre-\ncaution to be expected from a man in his position of trust. As the\nquestion addressed to the Gaon shows, the man had not hidden the\ngold beneath the floor, in a wall, above the ceiling, or in any other\nsafe place, but had kept it in the house, because he had just\nreceived it and wished to check the amount.™\n\nIn a calise celebre, represented in the Geniza by at least six docu-\nments, a dying merchant appoints two guardians and one super-\nvisor for his only son. In their early actions, when approaching\ndebtors of the dead man, the guardians cooperate with their\nsupervisor. In the later records the supervisor is not mentioned. I\nwonder where the office of supervisor of guardians originated.\nSince the Hebrew document of the year 1026 referred to above\nuses an Aramaic term for it, I assume that this was a pre-Islamic,\nancient Near Eastern institution.*\n\nI have termed it a cause celebre, because persons from different\ncountries, religions, and professions were involved, several Jewish\nand Mushim authorities were approached, public appeals were\nmade, and the affair dragged on for a number of years. An\nAndalusian merchant, Samuel, in Arabic Isma‘il, ha-Levi b.\nAbraham, when in Fustat, felt his end approaching and assembled\n“a big crowd” of Karaite and Rabbanite Jews, as well as of Muslims\nqualified to testify before a qadi. In their presence, he appointed a\nBaghdadi with the family name Nili (dealer in indigo) and a banker\nas guardians of his only son Abraham. A man whose grand-\nfather was called Yazdad (“God-given,” Persian), that is, from a\nfamily native in Iran, was chosen by him as their supervisor.\nA Rabbanite judge was also present. The guardians were Rabban-\nites, the supervisor probably a Karaite. They were given complete\nfreedom of action, were not obliged to make accounts, nor could\nany oath be imposed on them. Two fragments of the official\ndocument serving as the legal instrument for these appointments\nare extant. They are entirely in Aramaic, which also seems to\nindicate that the office of a supervisor of guardians was pre-\nIslamic.®\n\nThree documents show how the guardians fulfilled their task.\nThe first two are letters to former partners of the deceased.

One letter\nconcludes with the admonition: “Live up to your reputation.” The\nnames of the partners addressed have not been preserved.®\n\nThe third document, a huge Hebrew court record, shows the\neffect of the guardian’s action. A merchant known otherwise as\ncommuting between Tunisia and Egypt, had had a partnership\nwith the deceased Andalusian worth 1,043 dinars, part of which\nhad reverted to him during his lifetime. A careful examination of\nthe relevant papers and account books showed that a sum of\n136 1/2 dinars was still owed. The amount was delivered to the\nguardians, and the partner was released from the oath due to the\norphan with regard to any amount owed to his father on condition\nthat he be prepared to take it, if requested to do so by the latter,\nwhen he came of age.**\n\nThe affair did not end as harmoniously as it started. The orphan\nAbraham b. Samuel al-Andalusi was declared of age in January\n1026 when still a teenager and began to make trouble. At his\ninstigation, the guardians were forced by the government o\nproduce their accounts and were threatened with flogging, or were\nactually flogged, by a Jewish court. On December, 1027, Abraham\nagain brought them before a court and demanded that a balance\nstill due be delivered. They refused unless a proper release be\ngiven to them before a Jewish judge and a qadi. They were not\nprepared to produce additional accounts, since they had been\nexpressly exempted from this duty by the orphan’s father. A\ncommittee of three, headed by Samuel ha-Kohen b.

But taken all together a fairly consistent\npractice of the courts regarding the care of orphans emerges. The\njudge retained constant supervision, although this duty was not\nalways exercised in an efficient manner. The attorney who was to\nretrieve the estate, the guardian with whom the child was put, and\nthe keepers who held the orphan’s assets would be replaced by\nothers if the judge saw fit, or, rather, if he was approached by a\ncomplainant with the request to do so. Preserving the capital left\nseems to have been the foremost concern of the authorities. If\nfeasible, it was put into the hands of more than one person; the\nkeepers had to provide collateral, usually real estate, sometimes\nalso guarantors. No remuneration was expected for this service.\nAlimony was in accordance with the amount of the estate, but\nalways modest. When the support of the orphan had to come out of\nhis capital, each payment had to be approved by the judge or his\nrepresentative. The red tape often caused great hardship, since the\nauthorities did not always act promptly when the widow or\nguardian approached them with the request to release the amounts\napproved.

His office would come to an end at the orphan’s maturity.®®\n\nA widow, contemporaneous with ‘Ulld, complained to the Nagid\nMevorakh that her brother-in-law, who had been appointed by her\nlate husband as executor for her children, was too weak to deal\nwith a hard bargainer like “The Doctor” (the representative of the\nmerchants Aba Ya‘qab al-Hakim), a business partner of the\ndeceased. For the sake of God, the Nagid should spend an hour of\nhis precious time in dealing with this matter, for “he had the\nwisdom of an angel of God” (11 Samuel 14:20). The personal inter-\nvention of the Nagid was needed, for the law made it obligatory to\ncarry out the will of a dying man, wherefore the judges had been\nreluctant to take the office of the executor from the uncle of the\norphans and to entrust someone else with it.*”\n\nThe transter of orphans’ capital from one trustee to another was\nan easier matter. Samuel, “The Master of the Discerning,” who is\nnone other than the often mentioned Ben Asad,*® served as\n“guarantor” for a banker in al-Mahalla in whose keeping orphans’\nmoney had been deposited. Under circumstances not specitied\nSamuel handed over the amount to another trustee, who was\nadvised not to make any payments from it except upon a written\norder from the court.*’\n\nThe role of guarantor is also present in a venture on behalf of an\norphan, undertaken by Samuel Ben Asad together with his son Eli,\nprobably with the intention to groom him in deeds of charity,\nwhich might also prove to be a bit profitable. The orphan had\nreached maturity, but was not yet regarded by the court as able to\nmanage the estate. An amount of 56 1/2 dinars, perhaps only a\nfraction of the whole, was entrusted to father and son, who stood\nsecurity with their own possessions, real estate and movables, and\none for the other, “the living for the dead, the present for the\nabsent, and the well-to-do for the indigent.” The document states\nthat the orphan was present in court during the procedures.”\n\nEntrusting the property of orphans to two persons, each\nresponsible separately for the total amount, seems to have been a\ncommon practice of the courts in those days, for we find Samuel\nBen Asad a third time in such a role. Again a widow applied\ndirectly to the Nagid, this time Samuel b. Hananya, because it was a\ncase in which the will of a dying man had to be changed. The father\nof the orphans had left them, among other items, shops in the town\nof Malij, from whose rent they should be supported.

The latter would trade with this merchandise, add\nthe profit to the income from the shops, and provide 1 dinar per\nmonth for his nephews. The instructions of the chief judges were\ncarried out before a proper court of three in the town of Minyat\nAshna, where, I assume, the family concerned lived (Jan. 1151).*\n\nIn the document just discussed it is assumed that one who held\nmoney belonging to orphans would make some profit with it, part\nof which would be used for their maintenance. The undertaking of\nthe holder to return the amount in full implies that the orphans\nparticipated in the profits, not in the losses. That was the law.” The\ndegree of security demanded from a man entrusted with an\norphan’s property depended, of course, on his financial circum-\nstances and on his standing in the society. For a man like Samuel\nBen Asad a declaration that he was accountable with ali his\npossessions found in a certain locality was sufficient.”® Less wealthy\nand less trusted people had to provide more substantial security.\nIn a detailed note in the hand of the judge Nathan b.

But when the judge wished to proclaim the customary “ban\nin general terms” (see Med. Soc., 11, 340—341), the elder son, a well-\noff merchant, protested: “God has not put me in a position where I\nneed to take anything from the share in the estate of his father\nfrom the orphan, my minor brother.” The share of the orphan,\naccording to him, was 80 dinars, which was to be kept by him until\nthe boy came of age. Moreover, as an act of charity, for which he\nhoped to be rewarded by God in this world and in the world to\ncome, he would provide his brother with food, clothing, and\nanything else needed to the amount of a minimum of 15 dirhems\nper month. This would mean about 4 to 4 1/2 dinars over a year\nagainst possible profits to be made from the 80 dinars. Since no\nsecurity was given for the principal, this was obviously an under-\ntaking of no great religious merit.*\n\nWe have read about cases where a dying man appoints a wife, a\nson, or a brother as plenipotentiary executors, explicitly or\nimplicitly freeing them from the supervision of the courts.”” We\nhave also seen that despite such provisions courts did intervene.®®\nThe general procedure seems to have been that immediately after\na death the customary precautions for safeguarding the rights of\nheirs, and in particular orphans, were taken, but as soon as the\nlegal position was cleared, much depended on the circumstances,\nincluding the power yielded by the authorities dealing with the\ncase.\n\nWhen orphans possessed real estate, the courts, according to the\ncircumstances, either converted it into gold, or tried to preserve it,\neven if keeping it in repair required spending most of the gold left\nto them. The most eminent experts on housing would be consulted\nand their advice followed, whereupon the trustee would be advised\nto release the amount agreed upon.

Finally, if the property was conspicuous, or\nbelonged to a person connected with the government, it was always\nin danger of attracting the attention of rapacious officials, with the\nusual catastrophic consequences. In one such case, the executor,\nagain Abu ’l-Ma'ali (Samuel Ben Asad), had to spend 220 dinars in\norder “to get back” the property, which he then sold for 300 dinars.\nThe uncle of the orphans bore the title Radiyy al-Dawla (“Pleasing\nthe Government”), and the father of their guardian was a katib,\nor government official. Probably the orphans’ father had been in a\nsimilar situation, which explains the fate of his real estate.”\n\nOften the cost of supporting an orphan was to come out of the\ncapital deposited for him with a guardian or a trustee. In such a\ncase court supervision was particularly rigorous. The cost had to be\nkept as low as possible, and each withdrawal from the principal had\nto be approved. An uncle who held the estate of his late brother,\nand whose orphaned nephew lived in his house, was permitted to\ntake from it only 20 dirhems per month for food and general living\ncosts, while clothing had to be approved separately. A list of the\nwithdrawals was to be submitted to the court.’® When the money\nwas held by a trustee, he received from time to time an order to pay\nthe alimony approved to the guardian, in one case 3 dinars for a\nperiod of four months, which would result in about 30 dirhems per\nmonth, or 1 per day (in reality, often somewhat less). The boy\nconcerned was the son of a goldsmith.**!\n\nWhen the orphan came of age, the trustee was ordered to deliver\nto him the balance of the estate. This balance was substantiated by\nthe acknowledgment of the receipt of the money deposited with\nthe judge as well as by the riga* (Ar.) béth din (Heb.), the orders of\npayment, issued by the court for the cost of the orphan’s food and\nclothing.'”” Declarations by orphans reaching maturity, male and\nfemale, that they had properly received all due them from an\ninheritance, have been discussed above in various contexts.'*\n\nThe material presented thus far shows how the administration of\nestates by courts affected the lives of minor heirs.

But before consider-\ning the lot of orphans specifically, it is perhaps proper to ask how\nthe handling of cases of inheritance by the courts influenced the\neconomy of the Geniza society in general.\n\nThe system of the administration of law in those parts and times,\nwhich did not know the institution of an attorney general and all\nthat goes with it, was susceptible to procrastination.

True, the sealing of the\nproperty of a deceased was customarily done immediately after his\ndeath and at the initiative of the authorities. Presumably it was\neffected in connection with the burial, in which a divine, or his\nrepresentatives, participated.'® But once that was done, it was up\nto interested persons or public minded notables to elicit further\naction. When an orphan stayed with a mother, a grandmother, an\nuncle, or a grandfather, who had not been appointed as executors,\nthe property could not be touched until someone was selected for\nthat office by a court. We have read how a court was urged to do\n50.'% When the executors and their supervisors or guarantors had\nbeen selected, the most difficult part of their job was to assemble\nthe minor heir’s estate, a process often woeful not only to him but\nalso to anyone who had had dealings with the deceased. Since a\nminor could not act legally, his executors had to guarantee that\nthey would be liable if the dead man’s debtors or partners were\nsued by the orphans come of age. Often a contested property had\nto be left untouched until a settlement or decision had been\nreached, or even until the minor was able to act.\n\nA case like that, where a merchant in Egypt, who had become\ninvolved with an orphan in Sicily, had to apply to the Jewish\nauthorities in his own country, in Tripoli, Libya, and in Jerusalem,\nis described in Med. Soc., 11, 395—396. Another one encompassing\ndifferent countries must have dragged on for years. A noted writer\nof liturgical poetry, Nahum b. Joseph Baradani, was elected head\ncantor of the great synagogue in Baghdad at a time when he hap-\npened to be in Qayrawan, Tunisia, probably as an emissary of the\nIragian yeshivas, but certainly also earning money for himself by\nsinging. He must then have been an old man, for Hay Gaon, in a\nletter written in 1006, mentions him as his schoolmate, with whom\nhe grew up in friendship, and Hay was at that time in his late six-\nties.'” Nahum sent merchandise and Hebrew books (the latter a\ngreat article of export from Qayrawan) to Egypt and subsequently\nappointed an agent to sell them in Palestine. The agent sold the\nmerchandise, but kept its price for himself, claiming that the dead\ncantor owed him more than the books had brought. Then he took\nthe books to Jerusalem (where they would be sold to pilgrims from\nall over the world), but still did not settle the matter. Meanwhile,\nthe old cantor, his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughters had\ndied.

This endangered their very preservation,\nphysically and otherwise. A document recording a settlement\nspecifically refers to such risks. A trader had brought merchandise\nfrom Tripoli, Lebanon, to Fustat and deposited them in various\nwarchouses. A short time after his return he died, leaving a teen-\nage son, who had been declared capable of dealing with movables\n(but not yet real estate) and another son who was a minor. The\nteenager received his share in a settlement with a representative of\nthe investor. The rest of the goods remained sequestered until the\ninvestor arrived in town. He suggested a generous division between\nhimself and the minor, taking what was due him and releasing the\nminor from all future responsibility, “for if the goods remained in\nthe warehouses until the little one comes of age, anything could\nhappen to them” (July 1094).'**\n\nAn especially serious cause of delay in the freeing of an estate\nwas the frequent disagreement between judges or jurisconsults\nabout the rights of the parties concerned.'® An extraordinarily\nstrong letter written by the Jewish judge of Gaza, Palestine, and\nsigned by him and fourteen (twice seven''®) associates, to Ephraim\nb.

A man in the Egyptian Fayyam died childless, survived by a\nbrother in Gaza, three nephews from a sister, and a niece and\ngrandniece from a stepsister. As the letter emphasizes, the two\nsisters had been outfitted and married by their father. According to\nJewish law, the legal situation was therefore beyond doubt: the\nsurviving brother was the sole heir. But Ephraim refused to release\nthe estate, and our letter was destined to accompany the man of\nGaza, who traveled to Egypt in order to transport the bones of his\nbrother for burial in Jerusalem. Ephraim’s reasoning is not pro-\nvided. According to Muslim law, we remember, the sisters’ progeny\nhad a claim on the inheritance.

Nathan warns a local judge not to\nwrong the partner of a deceased merchant who had left minor\nchildren “even to the amount of a penny,” for the sages had said:\n“Orphans who eat what is not theirs should go after those who left\nthem.” Another Geniza letter emphasizes that awarding to orphans\nwhat they are not entitled to was as great a sin as depriving them of\ntheir rights.!'\n\nWe in our own times are only too familiar with the troubles to be\nincurred in the settlement of an inheritance. The difference is that\nthe economy in those days was so much weaker. In order to\nprosper, the little that people possessed had to work all the time. Its\nprolonged sequestration in favor of minor heirs was a disaster.'**\n\nThe lot of orphans—Because husbands ran away so often, for\nmany children orphanhood began when their fathers were still alive.\nIt was so common that the Arabic language coined a special term\nfor it: aytam al-ahyd, “orphans whose parents are still alive.” In a list\nof beneficiaries at a communal distribution of wheat “an orphan\nwhose parents are alive” appears as a legal term, meaning that the\nminor was eligible for public charity just like a regular orphan.'® A\nletter written by the teacher and court clerk Judah al-‘Ammani in\nFebruary 1228 conveys to the judge Elijah b.

A court record signed by the judge Yehiel b.

When a judge in Malij, Lower Egypt, reports to his\nsuperior in Fustat that “the little orphan girl does embroidery\nevery day,” he meant that she worked in other people’s houses.'*®\n\nWhen a widow died, her children normally found shelter in the\nhouse of a relative, the father’s brother being the “natural”\nchoice.””\" In this matter, too, the courts acted as the orphans’\nguardians. We find one put in the house of a person not character-\nized as a relative even though a paternal uncle was extant; or, when\na widow in a small place died, leaving a girl of three (together with\na small house), the judge in the capital, among other questions,\nasked for a report on who took the orphan into his house and cared\nfor her.'** We have read about a decision made by a high authority\nrefusing to give a small boy to a woman who claimed to be his next\nof kin, but ordering him to stay in the house where he lived before\nhis mother’s death.'*\n\nWhen the family was not able or willing to provide a home, or\nwhen no appropriate relatives were available, the orphans were put\nwith a trusted family, preferably that of a teacher or cantor, or the\nwidow of one.

The\nnumber of orphans remaining after the relatives had done their\nduty was small and did not call for the creation of one. Moreover,\nthe notion that children belonged in a house with a family, even if\nit was only an adopted one, was too strong to permit placing\norphans in a barrucks-like place. The so-called orphanages erected\nby Muslim rulers in a later period were often nothing but training\nschools for future soldiers. ’\n\nNumerous Geniza letters are cries for help of orphans and their\nmothers, lacking food and clothing, and sometimes even a proper\nplace to live. The father had died without leaving a thing, the\nrations fixed by communal charity were insufficient, and, not un-\ncommon, the payments due from estates under the administration\nof the courts had not been made in time or in the required\namounts. Such pictures of misery are often topped by the woeful\nexcuse that the mother was unable to work because of illness (“your\nmaidservant’s eyes are sore and have been bandaged for the last\nforty days”) or general incapacity.'’\n\nThe judges, it seems, released money for the orphans only when\napproached. A concise, but instructive letter of recommendation\nby a local official states that the bearer, Sdlim b. Hartin,'*® had ad-\nmitted the three orphans of his late brother to his house, but for\nsome time nothing had been paid out of the estate, because he,\nSalim, was away in Gaza, Palestine, on a business trip. Meanwhile,\nthe children had iived at his and his mother’s expense. But now\nwheat and clothing had to be bought for them. Salim applied for\nthe release not of the money held by the judge but for that en-\ntrusted to a local man called “the Son of the Pious.”\"”® With that\namount he would again travel to Gaza, and from the profit made\nbuy what was necessary for the orphans. Salim, the official assures\nthe judge, was a reliable man, “punctual in fulfilling his obliga-\ntions.”** Proper bills of debt would be made out before Muslim\nand Jewish notaries.\"*!\n\nTwice in this letter it is emphasized that the clothes to be bought\nfor the orphans would be of cotton.

Since the position\nof a wife dépended largely on the strength of her family and the\nmeans she brought into the marriage, the female orphan’s pros-\npects in life were dark. Her natural refuge was a position as a\ndomestic in a friendly household. But people seem not to have\nbeen eager to employ orphans, and we read little about it in the\nGeniza. For understandable reasons the community insisted that\norphan girls be married as soon as possible. (Nowhere have I read\nabout an orphan girl becoming a prostitute.) Things being so, it\nwas not practicable to a household to employ a domestic who would\nleave precisely when she would become fully capable of doing the\nchores. One preferred slave girls. In this light must one under-\nstand an emphatic passage in Maimonides’ Code of Law, where he\ndeclares that the keeping of slaves means sin and iniquity, day in,\nday out, while employing orphans and the poor turns every hour\ninto a good and meritorious deed.\"*\n\nNaturally, sometimes an orphan serving in a household would\nattract the attention of a visitor, especially if he was a stranger on\ntravel, whose family was far away and could not guard him against\nso foolhardy a step as marrying a penniless orphan.’** When any-\nthing of that kind occurred, people could become quite apologetic:\n“Your son has done nothing wrong.

Moreover, the rent from the store would\naccrue to him only after maturity.

        "text": "312 The Nuclear Family viii, C, 4\n\nLooking back over the data presented in this subsection (which\nmay be complemented by the detailed description of communal\nsocial services in Med. Soc., 11, 91—143), we ask ourselves how in\nfact the Geniza society did provide for its orphans. The answer\nmust be, first, that their care was certainly regarded as a religious\ncommandment of the very first order, and both the community\nand individuals were eager to earn “merits” by this deed of charity.\nBut even conceding that our information is one-sided, because\nmisery is clamorous whereas well-being is reticent, our general\nverdict must be negative. We read too much about the sufferings of\nthe orphans and their widowed mothers. The reason for this was\npartly factual: the weakness of the economy and the looseness of\nthe juridical and communal organizations. In addition, however,\nconceptual shortcomings, religious and social, must share responsi-\nbility for that unsatisfactory state of affairs. God has decreed death\nfor the father, the maintainer of the family; we human beings may\ntry to alleviate the consequences of God’s decree; we are not\nsupposed to change it. The individual’s strength was derived from\nhis family: when the family was impaired by the death of the\nfather, the survivors became weakened, if not destroyed. Further-\nmore, society was competitive and self-reliant; everyone had to\nlook after himself. If the orphan wished to survive, he had to fight.\nIn this book have been cited quite a number of articulate orphan\ngirls who brought their claims before the highest authorities or\neven to the community at large. Finally, this was a male-oriented\nsociety; when the father died, his dependents became, as it were,\noutsiders; they had no rights, only a claim to charity. But human\ncharity, as a prayer has it, “is scarce in providing, but plentiful in\ncausing shame.”\n\nD. THE WORLD OF WOMEN\n\nOutside men’s purview.—The men who left us their writings in the\nGeniza believed that “the princess’ place is in the innermost corner\nof the house,” that women should be confined to the narrow circle\nof the family. Whether and how far the actual experience of these\nvery men tallied with their ideas about the women’s role in society is\nthe topic of the study undertaken in this section.\n\nRecorded history seems to suggest that human males have a\ntendency to form more or less compact groups, from which the\nindividual derives a position of strength. Such strength is needed\nand used in manifold ways, among them to help the male overcome\nthe female. Whether this drive to form groups is inherent in the\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The medieval civilization reflected in this book certainly was\none characterized by its strong and compact groups of males.\nWarriors, courtiers, men of religion, scholars, physicians, mer-\nchants, and craftsmen were brothers to one another, and, like\nbrothers, often fought among themselves. The women were at-\ntached to the groups of their fathers and husbands, but they did\nnot belong. A man’s company consisted of men—or, at least, so it\nseemed.\n\nI wish to illustrate this world of males by two tidbits from Arabic\nliterature, one from the first century of medieval Islam, and one\nfrom the last. The newlywed wife of a caliphal crown prince (who\nhad, of course, other wives and concubines) perceived that her\nhusband was a great lover of wine. She procured the best wine to be\nhad and prepared for him a dinner of fish with a salty sauce. The\nprince was delighted with the food, but remarked that the fish\nwished to swim. She brought out the wine and the prince was\ndelighted. “But there is still something missing.” “What is it?”\n“Someone to talk to.” She brought in her two brothers. The prince\nliked them, they became his boon companions, and she his favorite\nwife.”\n\nThe male’s incapacity of “talking” to a woman is depicted\nagain—centuries later—in a different setting. A volume, Women’s\nLiberation, published in Cairo, 1899—one¢ of the most moving\nArabic books I have read—describes and deeply deplores the\nplight of the husband who was unable to communicate with his wife\nbecause she lacked even the barest contact with his social and\nspiritual ambiance.?\n\nThe existence of male groups does not preclude the formation of\nfemale groups within or alongside the world of men. It is precisely\nthis question which must ultimately occupy us in studying the\nwomen of the Geniza society. How deeply were they integrated in\nthe male ambiance around them, how much did they identify\nthemselves with it or live lives apart—all this should become\nclarified with the aid of the additional Geniza sources presented in\nthis section, taken together with the materials studied on the\npreceding pages.\n\nMen were supposed to know only the women of their own\nhouschold or extended family. Consequently, a woman appearing\nin court or before a notary was introduced, in principle, by the\nphrase “after we have taken [proper] cognizance of her,” a phrase\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Since this phrase is rendered not\nonly in Arabic and Hebrew, but also in Aramaic, the language\nspoken in Southwest Asia before the advent of Islam, it is reason-\nable to assume that the practice was pre-Islamic. One suspects,\nhowever, that the phrase is often added only out of reverence for\ntraditional attitudes and not because the judge or his associates\nactually did not know the woman before them. This assumption\nbecomes reality when we find the phrase repeated on the second\nday of a lawsuit after a woman had already testified in the presence\nof the same court the day before, or when three gentlemen first\ntalk a girl into a marriage, assuring her that they knew her well,\nand when she agreed, and the formal betrothal was concluded, the\nclerk again notes “after having made proper cognizance of her.™\nIn numerous court records referring to women this clause is\nmissing altogether.® All in all it seems that the judicial practice\nbased on the notion that women were known only to their own\nmenfolk did not quite correspond to reality. This is not surprising,\nsince women, rich and poor, single and married, were involved in\neconomic activities, which required their presence in the offices of\nnotaries and in courts. These were places frequented by many\nmen, since legal actions required publicity (and aroused curiosity).\n\nBefore exploring the common meeting grounds of men and\nwomen, we should like to hear the voices of the women themselves.\nBut how to do this, seeing that, as a rule, men wrote the Geniza\npapers that have come down to us? We have one direct access to the\nworld of women: the names they chose for their daughters. For\nnames then, and in particular those of women, were not what they\nare today: they were keys to the innermost thoughts of those who\ngave them.\n\nThe message of women’s names.—Today we choose a name because\nwe imagine it sounds attractive, or because it is traditional in the\nfamily, or has some other connotation for us, but, as a rule, we pay\nno attention to its meaning, which, in most cases, is unknown to us.\nIn the Geniza, to the contrary, female names were living words,\neach with a distinctive connotation, of which those who gave them\nwere well aware. The meaning of a name and the frequency of its\noccurrence are therefore true indicators of what a woman wished\nfor her daughter and, by implication, for herself.\n\nThe large number and wide variety of female names given at\nbirth immediately attract attention.

Add to these the\nmany telling nicknames given to women during their lifetimes\nwhich then stay with their descendants as family names, and we\ngain the impression that these medieval women, far from being\ncolorless, had much character and individuality.\n\nIn another context I have drawn attention to the rich onomast-\nicon of ancient Israel and pre-Islamic Arabia, both well known to\nus. The equally abundant treasure of female names in the Geniza\nperiod is derived from neither. It is entirely different from both. It\noriginated independently owing to the specific situations, the\nstirrings and aspirations of the women within the new civilization\nwhich matured in the Near Eastern and Mediterranean Islamic\ncities during the High Middle Ages.®\n\nA second trait that catches the eye is the complete absence of\nbiblical and other Hebrew names among the Jewish women of\nEgypt. In the rare times when they are found it can be shown that\nthe family originated in Palestine, Tunisia or other North African\ncountry, Spain, Byzantium, or Western Europe, where biblical\nnames were occasionally given to females. This startling deficiency\nwould seem to demonstrate a chasm between the popular local\nsubculture of the women and the worldwide Hebrew book culture\nof the men. The dichotomy is even more emphasized by the purely\nsecular character of the female names, which, with very few\nexceptions, confined to upper class, mostly Karaite, families, do not\ncontain any reference to God or other religious concepts.”\n\nI must add that I have made the same observation with regard to\nthe Jewish women of Yemen, among whose husbands religious\nlearning was more diffused than had been so with the Jews of\nEgypt in the Geniza period.®* One must therefore reckon with the\npossibility that the absence of biblical and theophoric names among\nwomen was originally not a matter of free choice but was a taboo\nimposed by males, and became an accepted custom only in the\ncourse of time. But that is mere surmise.\n\nNames from Arabic classical or popular narratives also are\nseldom found. There is Layld, the heroine of the stories of the\nlove-mad poet Majnin, ‘Abla, the beloved of the great warrior\n‘Antara, ‘Atika, the favorite wife of the caliph ‘Abd al-Malik, and\nBiniqa, the boy-like daughter of the caliph Ma’'miin.® The very\nrare occurrence of those names induces doubt that they were taken\ndirectly from the narratives concerned; the names were probably\nchosen because they were in general use, just as today a mother will\ncall her daughter Angelica without having the faintest idea that she\n\nGoitein, S.

With this I do not wish to\nimply that Jewish women did not listen to Arabic folktales.'\n\nThe third, and most surprising aspect of the female Geniza\nnomenclature is the prevalence in it of the ideas of ruling,\novercoming, and victory. Most of these names are composed with\nthe word sitt, “mistress,” “female ruler,” originally an honorary title\nadded to a name, which became the personal name of a girl given\nto her at birth.\" The word Sitt was often omitted, so that strange\nforms of female names result. Above, we had ‘Ama’im, “Turbans,”\nabbreviated from Sitt al- Ama’im, “She who Rules over the Tur-\nbans,” namely, the men.'” A girl belonging to the class of govern-\nment officials was called Sit¢ al-Kuttab, “Mistress of the Clerks,” in\nshort, Kuttab, “Clerks,” the daughter of a big merchant, Sitt al-Tujjar,\nor Tujjar, “Merchants,”'” one of the higher class in general, “Lords”\n(Sadah), or “Upper Class” (Khassah). Hence the strange names born\nby girls: such as Mulitk, “Kings” (frequent), or those of countries,\ncities, or peoples. We have several times Sut Baghdad, “The Mistress\nover Baghdad,” and simply Baghdad, or Ramle, the same for Iraq\n(‘Irag), the Muslim West (Gharb), Byzantium (Ra@m), and the\nPersians (Furs).\n\n. Names describing their bearers as ruling the house (Dar), the\nhousehold (Bayt), the family (Ahl), the clan (‘Ashir), brother or\nsisters, or boys or girls in general, are natural, and therefore\nfrequent. A most common female name in the Geniza is Sitt al-Kull,\n“She who Rules over Everyone,” paralleled by Sitt al-Jami:\nwhich means the same, Sitt al-Nds, “Mistress over Mankind,” Sut\nal-Zamdn, “Mistress of her Time,” and Sut al-Agran, “Ruling over\nher Peers.” The names Sitt A‘dghd, “Mistress of her Enemies.”\nand Sitthum, “Their Mistress,” are particularly noteworthy.'*\n\nThe group of names describing a woman as ruling over certain\ntypes of people or all of them is matched by another composed of\nSitt with an abstract noun. Here again the idea of eminence is\nfound throughout. The most common names of this type were\nFakhr, “Glory,” Thana’, “Praise,” ‘Izz, “Fame,” followed by similar\nnotions, such as Ri'asa, “Leadership,” Nasr, “Victory,” Nazar,\n“Control, Supervision,” Ma'ali, “Excellence,” Ghalb, “Overcoming,”\nand so forth. Telling names in this context are Qa’ida, “[female]\nGeneral,” Wazira, “Vizier,” and ‘Alam, “Flag” (at the head of an\nadvancing troop, common). Labwa, “Lioness,” not found in pre-\nIslamic Arabia, probably also belongs to this category.'s\n\nHow shall we explain the female names, considered thus far,\nwhich come to almost 70 percent of the material?

It should be noted that the proud names\npresented above were not particular to Jewish women.'”\n\nSome names display opposing and unexpected traits. “Bash-\nfulness,” the allegedly intrinsic characteristic of women,'® is re-\npresented by the names Haya’ and Khafar, which are less common\nthan one would expect. Twice as often as both together we find the\nopposite: Dalal, “Coquetry, taking liberty with someone, boldness,”\nor Fa'iza, “Successtul [with men),” Khulla, “Lover,” Haziyya, “Fav-\norite,” Mawadda, “Love.” The names Minisa, and, even more\nremarkable, in the masculine form, Muwanis, “Good Compa-\nny,” “Intimate Friend,” probably also contain a wish for success\nin marriage. As an Arabic (and Judeo-Arabic) saying has it:\n“Enchanted by his beloved [wife], a man neglects his [male]\ncompanions.”\"®\n\nChastity and Fertility, regarded by men as the most praiseworthy\nattributes of a women, are all but absent from the female ono-\nmasticon of the Geniza. Many men are called “Pure,” Tahir (Ar.) or\nTahor (Heb.), or “Chaste,” ‘Afif, but 1 have not yet come upon a\nTihira or ‘Afifa.?® Thamira, “Fertile,” has been met with only once.?!\nThese things were taken for granted by women. It was their lot,\nimposed on them by God, to be faithful to their husbands and to\nbear them children. There was no point in expressing it as a special\nwish embodied in a name. But that their menfolk should remain\npure and chaste was indeed a deep concern for mothers, since\nconcubinage with slave girls was the most dreaded source of\nmarital conflict.\n\nNames designating noble lineage, such as Nasab, Nisgba, and\nHasab, were common. Especially in families that had scen better\ndays the emphasis was not redundant. Karima, “noble, distin-\nguished,” had in the Geniza period the additional meaning of\n“sister” (unlike modern Arabic, where it means “daughter”) and is\nfound as a female name also in a Muslim marriage contract of\n1028.2\n\nThere is no need to survey here names with general connotations\nwhich are found all over the world.

Many names express the wish for a long life,\nthe most impressive of which is the very common Najiya, “Saved,”\nindicating the dangerous times through which the Geniza people\noften had to live.* Others carry a wish for happiness, joy, and\ncontentment.\n\nGirls should be beautiful.

We find the same in a contemporary family\nchronicle from southern Italy (where the names, of course, were\nnot Arabic, but Latin or Hebrew) in which a girl is called Cassia like\nthe mother of her father.”® We should not generalize. It stands to\nreason, however, that the custom—unknown in biblical times—of\nstrengthening the family attachment of a newborn by giving him\nthe name of an ancestor or other relative was observed in the\nGeniza period also with regard to girls.*\n\nChanging fashions in the preferences for certain names or\ngroups of names for girls can be observed throughout the “clas-\nsical” Geniza period. On the other hand, the longevity of some\nnames, even rare ones, is remarkable. Umm al-Khayr, “Possessor\n{literally, “Mother”] of Goodness,” found thus far only once in a\nJewish document, dated 1029, appears again as the name of a\nMuslim noble woman, married in Aswan three hundred years\nlater, in 1334.*° And some female names from the Geniza, es-\npecially those composed with Sitt, have lived on well into the\nsecond half of the twentieth century, at least in the Karaite\ncommunity of Cairo (whose weekly with its family news 1 had\nopportunity to read in the 1950s).\n\nThe messages contained in the female names of the Geniza\nperiod must be heeded by anyone trying to penetrate into the\nsecluded world of its women.\n\nHistorical antecedents—In order to put the women's world of the\nGeniza period in its proper historical context some of its ante-\ncedents must be considered, if only in the barest outlines.\n\nThe women of ancient Israel, as they appear to us in the Hebrew\nBible, were disadvantaged by polygyny and all that went with it, but\nthey played a far more vital role than their female progeny in\npostbiblical times.\n\nIn that pristine peasant society the wife was “man’s helper, his\ncounterpart.” (This is the proper rendering of Genesis 2:18.) He\nproduced the food, she made the clothing. He was afield, either\ntilling the soil, from daybreak to sunset, or deliberating with the\nelders “at the gate,” sometimes also participating in a war; she ran\nthe house, planning, storing, buying and selling, spinning and\nweaving, and dispensing help to the needy and advice to whomever\nsought it.

Joseph was the manifest\nfavorite of his father Jacob because he was the son of his beloved\nRachel. “Am I not better to you than ten sons,” the barren, but\npreferred Hannah is consoled by her husband (I Samuel 1:8). The\nwife was her husband’s “companion” (Malachi 2:14). Hence the\nmany and unforgettable portraits of women presented by the\nHebrew Bible. Those men paid attention to their women. They\nknew them.\n\nFinally, marriage in biblical times, unlike that of the Geniza\nperiod, possessed the halo of permanence. “Your clan will be mine;\nyour deity will be worshipped by me. Where you die, I will die, and\nthere I will be buried; even death will not separate me from you.”\nThis is the vow of the bride (Ruth 1:16—17, where the attachment\nto the dead husband is extended to his bereaved mother). The wife\nleaves the house of her father and clan and becomes a member of\nthe husband’s family. This severance was so strict that a woman of\nthe progeny of Aaron, when married out of the priestly clan, was\nno longer permiited to partake of the sacrificial meal restricted to\nKohens, and her parents and siblings were not allowed to “defile\nthemselves” by following her bier. She on her side agreed to be\nburied in the common tomb of her new family. The husband’s vow\nequally stressed permanence. “I betroth you to me for eternity, 1\nbetroth you to me in equity and justice [you will get all due to you]\nin love and mercy [and more than that], and I betroth you to me in\nsteadfastness [a reiteration of the everlasting character of the\nmarital bond]” (Hosea 3:19—~20; here said by God to Israel).\n\nIsrael's religion, however, was not favorable to the fair sex. A\nwoman could enter the temple and pray, as Hannah did, but the\nimmediate service of God was reserved for male priests. Women\ncould be possessed by God’s spirit; they could become prophets,\nlike Miriam, Deborah, and Hulda (2 Kings 22:13—20). The very\nlast prophet mentioned in the Bible by name, No‘adya (“Meeting\nwith God™), was a woman (Nechemiah 6:14). But they were ex-\nceptions. In the sanctuary men alone were permitted to officiate.\nThe reason for this, I believe, was the obsession with ritual purity\n(endangered by the women’s monthly menstrual cycle), an obses-\nsion shared by other ancient peoples. The oracle of Delphi, Greece,\nwas pronounced by a woman prophet, but the priests were men.\nThe women of ancient Israel reacted against the antifeminism of\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In all the teaching and other public assemblies\nwomen were expressly mentioned among those present, even\nprominently (Ezra 10:1, Nehemiah 5:1, 8:23, 12:43) as was fore-\nseen in the book that contains the program for that revival\n(Deuteronomy, 29:10, 31:12).' Women now become the protag-\nonists for the salvation of their people, like Esther in the Bible and\nJudith in the apocryphal book named after its heroine, and in the\nSynagogue and the Church the mother of the seven Maccabean\nmartyr brothers, who died after encouraging her sons not to yield\nto idolatry (Second and Fourth Books of the Maccabees), is the\nprefiguration of the woman-saint dying for her faith.®\n\nUnfortunately, however, the trend unfavorable to the partici-\npatiton of women in the community’s religious life became strength-\nened by a mighty new influence: Hellas. High cultures, character-\nized by rational reasoning, are prone to abase their women. For as\nsoon as the men begin to ponder the low state of their women, a\nstate partly inherited from an earlier stage of civilization, they feel\nthe urge to explain and to justify the situation, and by this to\nexonerate themselves of this imbalance. Thus, they add theoretical\ndemeaning to actual oppression. The Greeks, who thought deeper\nand more systematically than preceding cultures, came up with\nmanifold theories. Aristophanes and Plato, each in his own way,\neven visualized the possibility of almost complete equality. There\nseems to exist also, with regard to women, a strange contrast\nbetween Greek art and poetry, which magnified and idealized\nwomen, and life and scientific theory, which reduced them to a\nlower rank. Be that as it may, the conviction that woman is inferior,\nbiologically and mentally, became the dominant trend, with the\npractical consequence of excluding her from participation in the\npursuits of men.* With the Hellenization of the Mediterrancan\nworld this conviction resulted in the deprivation of women of their\nright to a proper education. The Jews were one of the peoples\naffected by this influence.\n\nStudying and expounding the Scriptures became the very core of\nrabbinical judaism, as it developed in the centuries before and\nafter the destruction of the Second Commonwealth (a.p. 70).

Some-\nthing similar happened in Islam. Muhammad, in his missionary\nzeal, addressed women frequently and strove to enlist their par-\nticipation. He also bettered their lot by legislation. But when the\nArabs moved out into the sedentary countries of the Near East,\nwhich were infected by an antifeminine bias, the reformatory spirit\nof Islam became blunted, and the excessive concubinage indulged\nin by the conquerors degraded womanhood irreparably. In Ju-\ndaism, the exlusion of women from the study of the Scriptures,\nwhich was the main expression of piety, inevitably had a degrading\neffect.\n\nYet the ways of the spirit are inscrutable. The reader who has\nfollowed me till here is reminded of Paul’s First Letter to the\nCorinthians: “Women should keep silence in the churches. They\nare not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the Law\nsays. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their\nhusbands at home” (14:34—35). Yes, women should not open their\nmouths in the church, but the letter implies that they were present\nthere. And very much so, as we know from their tangible role in the\ndiffusion of Christianity. The same happened in the Synagogue.\nThe mosaic inscriptions in the synagogues of late antiquity show\nwomen as frequent donors, and the zeal of women in helping their\nhusbands and sons to acquire religious learning is highly praised in\nthe Talmud. Rabbi Aqiba, the most popular of the Talmudic sages,\nis reported to have said to his disciples pointing to his wife: “Mine\nand yours is hers.” A subordinate role, if acquiesced in and\nsuccessfully performed, can be very satisfactory.®\n\nThe socioeconomic character of the Jewish community, and, with\nit, the position of its women, also changed markedly in postbiblical\nantiquity. Farming still was prominent, both in Babylonia-Iraq and\nin Palestine, as was recently brought home again by the astonishing\nfind of an unusually large agricultural inscription near Beth-\nShean, Palestine, believed by the editor to have been executed in\nthe seventh century (probably, however, somewhat before).>® But\nthe process that converted the Jews into an almost exclusively\n\nGoitein, S.

Iraq and Iran, with their\nPersian traditions, insisted on strict seclusion and subordination of\nwomen. On the other hand, it was the opulent Karaites and other\nrich and influential jews who emigrated from those parts to\nSyria-Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and farther afield, and, as is\nnatural in well-to-do families, their daughters gained from this\naffluence and became more independent than many women from\nthe local populations. There was a similar migration movement to\nthe Mediterranean countries among the Muslims of the East.*”\n\nVisitors to Egypt from the religiously strict and zealous Muslim\nWest, Morocco and its dependencies, were shocked by the easy-\ngoing ways of the Egyptian capital, where wine was publicly sold\nand women enjoyed much freedom. To explain the latter phe-\nnomenon a somewhat malicious legend was invented. When, by\nGod’s decree, Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned in the Red Sea,\nthe slaves of the dead Egyptians approached the widows proposing\nmarriage. The widows agreed but on one condition: that the\nEgyptian husbands always be slaves of their wives. The account\nconcludes: “Have you ever made a deal with a Copt? When you are\nsure that the matter is settled, he says to you: Wait, first I must go\nhome and consult my wife.” Copts are brought in here not as\nChristians, but as the indigenous Egyptians. The Muslim women of\nFustat were notorious for their license. “Every wife has two\nhusbands,” exclaims Muqaddasi, the great Muslim traveler from\nJerusalem, the holy city, whose people, again according to him,\nwere “the most virtuous of all mankind.”*®\n\nIt was unfortunate for Jewish women that rabbinical Judaism\ntook shape mainly in Iraq (Babylonian Talmud, the Gaons), and\nwas codified by Moses Maimonides, who came to Egypt from the\nMuslim West.

Before\ntrying to draw some general conclusions, the common meeting\ngrounds of men and women and female activities not directly\nconnected with family life must be briefly examined.\n\nWomen in economic life—In discussing the economic role of the\nwife* we came to the conclusion that, as far as the Geniza\ndocuments go, the problem of the working woman was virtually\nabsent during the tenth and eleventh centuries, became acute\nduring the twelfth, and paramount from the thirteenth on. This\nwas partly explained by the progressive impoverishment of the\nminority groups, or perhaps of the population at large, and partly\nalso by the loosening of standards of propriety, as men grew less\nreluctant to expose their wives to the outside world.*\n\nThe professions open or specific to women, as surveyed in Med.\nSoc., I, chap. ii, sec. 6, were limited and brought only small income.\nWomen’s possessions were mainly acquired through gift, dowry, or\ninheritance, and for many also through communal charity. But it\nwas precisely this derivative character of their participation in\neconomic life which constantly brought women in contact with the\nworld of men.\n\nThe number of widowed, divorced, or deserted women who had\nlost their struggle for a decent livelihood, or had never possessed\none, was very considerable.*' They could not sit at home, awaiting\nhelp. They had “to uncover their faces,” as the phrase went, to\nshow up in public, in order to secure their rights, or to obtain a\nminimum of sustenance. Our analysis of the functioning of the\ncommunal social services has shown that in order to be eligible for\npublic welfare a person had to be registered; these registrations\nwere frequently checked and changed. The semiweekly distri-\nbutions of bread and the occasional handouts of wheat, clothing,\nand cash were not delivered to the homes, but had to be picked up\nat the synagogue compound. All this required much moving\naround and unavoidable contacts with the men in charge of\nsupervision, registration, and distribution.*\n\nA concise note, two inches high, written and signed by the judge\nSamuel b. Saadya, illustrates: “The administrators of the Com-\npound of the Jerusalemites are advised to pay to ‘the Mother of\nAbraham,’ better known under the name ‘the Mother of the Little\nCalf; 9% dirhems, her share in the revenue from the Compound\nof the Jerusalemites for the year 1477 [of the Seleucid era, ap.\n\nGoitein, S.

But the\ncommunity of Fustat possessed a compound (sometimes referred\nto as a row) of houses whose rents served as alms for the Jewish\npoor of the Holy City. I have not yet found a direct statement as to\nwho the poor of Jerusalem were after the city was taken by the\nCrusaders. But we have two other notes written by that judge in the\nsame year and awarding the same sum from the same source to two\nmale persons, one of whom had the family name al-Dimashqi\n(from Damascus).* So we may perhaps be justified in assuming\nthat foreigners, especially of Syro-Palestinian descent, were re-\ngarded as eligible for these benefits.\n\nIn order to substantiate her claims, ‘the Mother of the Little Calf’\n(her son was probably a big fat man,) had to find witnesses who\nwere able and prepared to testify about her status (descent, poverty,\nno family in a position to support her, unable to work) and to\npresent them to the court. An application by a woman to a judge\nfor her share in the revenue from that compound was written\napproximately at the same time.* With the note of the judge the\nwoman had to find one of the administrators who had cash ready to\npay her—or, who would give her a promissory note to a tenant or a\ngrocer. All this for a sum sufficient for two or three weeks, at most.\n\nThe men in charge of social welfare were only a small section of\nthe male world with whom single poor women had contact. It was\ntheir fellow poor whom they constantly met while making use of\nthe communal services. When I started to study the organization of\npublic charity in the Geniza documents, I expected to find separate\nlists for men and women and separate days designated for the\ncollection of food, clothing, and cash by the members of each sex.\nNothing of the kind was found. All the lists show that women and\nmen mixed freely while receiving their welfare benefits. This seems\nto strengthen the earlier surmise that numerous marriage contracts\nmay have been contracts of convenience between indigent old men\nand women to form a common household. As we have seen, they\nhad much opportunity to meet one another.*®\n\nPrivate charity was different. The Geniza contains countless\nbegging letters written or dictated by men, none by women.\nWomen appealed to the heads of the community, to judges, or\nwelfare officials, and, naturally, also to members of their own\nfamily, but not to strange individuals. Considerations of decency\nclosed this avenue of economic support to women. Private charity\nwas extended to women, sometimes in grand style, butit could not be\nsolicited in the impersonal way permitted men.\"\n\nGoitein, S. D.

They receive as a gift or donate, inherit\nor bequeath, buy or sell, rent or lease houses (more often parts\nof houses), stores, workshops, flour mills, and other types of urban\nreal estate, and also take care of their maintenance. This most\nprominent aspect of the female role in the economy of Geniza\ntimes deserves closer study.\n\nWhen it is said of a girl that she “enters her house,” the reference\nis not to a house belonging to her but to the domicile of her\nhusband, which generally was on the premises of his family home\nor otherwise provided by him. Yet, to some extent, the husband’s\nhouse was hers, morally, because she was to become “the mis-\ntress of the house” and to take charge of its management, and\nlegally, since the house, like all other possessions of the husband,\nwas, as stated in the marriage contract, mortgaged to his obliga-\ntions toward her. In early deeds of sale the wife is mentioned first as\nthe seller, even when the property at issue was not brought into the\nmarriage by her. In one document it is expressly stated that the\nhouse concerned was inherited by the husband from his father.®®\nBy mentioning the wife first it was indicated that she had lifted her\nmortgage from the real estate sold and would lay no claim on it\nafter her husband’s death or a divorce. The wife’s mortgage rights\ncould become grim reality when the husband had no other means\nof absolving himself of his obligations toward her. Relevant ex-\namples have been adduced above.*\n\nIn some instances, an apartment brought in by the bride, either\nas part of her dowry or as her personal property, served as the\nresidence of the young couple.® But this was the exception rather\nthan the rule, since, ideally and normally, the husband provided the\nfamily’s domicile.® The primary purpose of providing a woman\nwith real estate was the creation for her of enduring economic\nsecurity, which would make her financially independent. This is\nself-evident in the numerous cases in which a woman possessed\nmore than one piece of property. For example, when a widow (or,\nless likely, divorcée) brings into the marriage, besides a valuable\nbridal outfit, “an entire large house in the Fortress of the Candles”\n(the Byzantine nucleus of the city of Fustat), another “large house\nin the Grand Bazaar opposite the Funduq” (merchant’s hostel), and\na quarter of a house somewhere else (where, not preserved);** or\nwhen the daughter of the India trader Abu ’I-Barakit Lebdi, at her\nengagement, is given five out of twenty-four shares in a mansion\nthat once had belonged to her grandfather, plus one half of the\nhouse of her late father, on condition that the rent of both will be\n\nGoitein, S.

Manasse (1100—1138), both unfinished,\ncertainly because of the delicacy of the subject matter. A common\ntrick of Islamic legal practice for circumventing the prohibition of\ntaking interest was this: A sold his house to B with the right of\nbuying it back after a fixed period. Meanwhile A remained in the\nhouse and paid B rent at an exorbitant price; in reality, that was the\ninterest. The same practice was adhered to, though to a limited\nextent, by Jews, mainly from the twelfth centuty on. Jayyida (“First\nRate”) possessed a house—or rather two thirds of it, for the other\nthird belonged to a Jewish pious foundation,\\as we know from a\nslightly later Arabic documient.® Jayyida needed 50 dinars (for\nwhat purpose, is not stated)} got them from David, the dyer, and\nsold him her house for two years with the promise to pay him a\ntotal “rent” of 16 dinars, 8 per year, in other words a usurious\nyearly interest of 16 percent. When Jayyida arrived in court, she\ndid not beat about the bush, but stated bluntly: “I took a loan etc.”\nThis was bad form, and after a few lines the court clerk broke off.™\n\nThe second testimony conformed even less with the ideas of\npropriety held by the courts. Two or more witnesses tell about their\nvisit to Jayyida’s place: '\n\nWe responded to hey request and went. She locked us all in, brought\nthe above-mentioned Mr. David and seated him and herself close to the\ndoor behind which we were, so that we should hear word for word what\neach of them said.

I owe\nyou only 50 dinars. How come you sue me for 662 Have we [meaning, I,\npl. of modesty] received from you anything above 50 dinars as price of the\nhouse? So why have you made out a writ of debt in my name to the\namount of 66 dinars?”\n\nJayyida had the witnesses listen in order to accuse David of taking\nfixed interest, a flagrant breach of the law of the Torah. But the\nclerk discontinued writing in the middle of the line, because the\ncircumvention of the law habitual in the Islamic environment had\nalso been accepted in Jewish courts and could not be treated as a\ncrime. I wonder what Jayyida’s husband, who was a scholarly\nperson, thought about this initiative of his enterprising wife.”\n\nReal estate could be turned into cash and then be invested in\ncommercial undertakings.

The first case of a loan given on\nfixed interest and noted in a record book of the rabbinical court of\nFustat (May 1156) is that of a woman lending 27 dinars to another\nwoman and her sen for the duration of six years, to be paid back in\nmonthly installments of % dinar. This makes a total of 36 dinars,\nincluding fixed interest of 9 dinars, which corresponds to about 11\npercent per year.”® A wandering preacher fulminated against the\nwomen of a town he visited as being usurers who lent money on\nfixed interest.”® An opposite case, a woman (and her husband)\narranging for a fictive sale of a house in order to secure a loan of 50\ndinars against interest has just been cited.”\n\nSuch operations could end in a disaster. A case, interesting in\nmore than one respect, may be summarized here. Bahiyya (“Ra-\ndiant”), the daughter of Yatish ha-Kohen, probably a relative of Eli\nb. Ya‘ish ha-Kohen, the social welfare official so often mentioned in\nthis book, had taken, in partnership with a Muslim, a loan of 42\ndinars from a Jew before a Muslim court. When the business\nventure in which the money was invested failed, long law suits\nbefore the rabbinical court ensued, since the issues were am-\nbiguous. In order to save Bahiyya from being dragged through\nMuslim courts, a compromise was reached: the creditor would\ndemand from Bahiyya only 30 dinars and get the remaining 12\nfrom the Muslim. Since Bahiyya did not have the cash, the sum was\nto be paid in equal shares by her husband and her brother Jacob.™\nBut her husband stalled. Finally, he agreed to pay 11 dinars, while\nthe brother bore the lion’s share of the burden of family respon-\nsibility (summer, 1057).” A brother sometimes felt this duty more\nstrongly than a husband. The reader is reminded of sisters\nproviding financial support for their brothers.*\n\nWomen regularly appear in the Geniza documents as buyers or\nsellers of servants, but those transactions should not be regarded as\ncommercial activities. To be sure, slaves, like houses, represented a\nfinancial investment, but they were acquired for domestic services,\nwherefore it is natural that women dealt with such matters,\nwhereas male servants acted as business agents and aides to\ntraveling merchants.

Moreover, a married woman, so far as she did not\npossess means outside the common pool of the nuclear family,\ndepended entirely on her husband, and, in his absence, on his male\nrelatives, even her own sons, or his business partners or friends.\nThis dependence was both humiliating and occasionally even\nprecarious. Yet many women, married and unmarried, had means\nof their own and made varied use of them, which made contacts\nwith men outside their own family unavoidable.\n\nWomen in court.—The question whether, as a matter of regular\npractice, women were free to fight for their rights in person or had\nto rely on others, that is, whether they were represented in the\ncourts by men, or acted on their own, deserves closer examination.\n“I went to the qadi,” writes a widow from Alexandria quite casually,\nand this in a letter destined for the attention of the Nagid\nMevérakh.

Muslim\nand Jewish court records differed characteristically in the practice\nof giving a description of the physical identity of the parties. This\nprocedure is never found in Jewish Geniza records but the Muslim\ncourts followed a tradition represented in the Greek papyri.

The other was the wish to protect the woman, either because\nshe was noble, or aged, and for these reasons not in the habit of\nmixing with people, or because she was in grief over a loss endured\n(in either of which case two witnesses would come to her house\nand take down her declaration); or because she was young and\ninexperienced, or otherwise incapable of action, wherefore a\nrepresentative, mostly a relative, would take up her cause.

In general, however, the demands of\njustice and proper procedure triumphed over consideration, or,\nrather, there was no need to be considerate, for the women were\nneither weak, nor inexperienced, nor overly shy or snobbish.\n\nWhere the interests of another party were directly involved, as in\nthe numerous instances of releases and their like, the presence of the\nwoman must have been regarded as specifically desirable. Many\ndocuments of this type have been preserved. A father bequeathed\na house to his married daughter. At his death three deeds, written,\nof course, in Arabic, were deposited with a man called Ibn al-\nMuhandiz, son of the surveyor, who probably followed the pro-\nfession of his father.®* This might have been done by the dying\nman himself, or, rather, by a court, because the legacy was\ncontested. Releases mostly marked the end of a lawsuit. Now the\ndaughter appears in court, receives the deeds, and releases their\nkeeper from all future responsibility. She was accompanied by her\nhusband, a government official, and her brother.* This should by\nno means be understood to signify that women, like minors, had to\nbe represented in court by a guardian. The husband had to share\nhis wife’s responsibility, while the brother, by his presence, ackriow-\nledged that the house was a deathbed gift, not an item inherited (in\nwhich case he, and not his sister, would have had a claim).\n\nGoitein, S.

A case where a release for a partner is\ncombined with a guaranty that a minor sister, when reaching\nmaturity could not sue him is reported above. The two sisters\ngiving the guaranty make the declarations in the presence of the\npartner of their late father; their husbands only confirm.* When a\nwidow brought one (nominal) sixth of a house into the new\nmarriage, her husband was afraid that the widow’s sons and a\nMuslim who held the other shares in the house might some day\nclaim that he, the husband, occupied more than one (real) sixth\nand ask him to pay them rent.

In case of default she would be banned and\nexcommunicated.'®*\n\nIn numerous cases women did not sue in person, but appointed a\nrepresentative, mostly a relative or a communal official.'* There is\nnothing specific about this: men did the same. A great variety of\nreasons compelled a person to make use of a proxy. The party sued\nwas out of town or had to be found. Real estate or other matters\nthat required action in a Muslim court formed the objects of\ncontention. Or the matter concerned was too complicated for action\nby an ordinary person. In all such instances no difference is to be\nnoted in the Geniza documents between men and women, and the\nnumber of men appointing a proxy is larger than that of women—\nfor the simple reason that we have more lawsuits in which men only\nwere involved. A special reason for a woman to employ the services\nof a representative was the necessity to sue a close relative such as a\nbrother or a hushand.\n\nA woman appointing a proxy could do so in court, as when Hasna\n(“the Belle”) b. Ezekiel b. Mas‘ad al- Aqrabani (from ‘Aqraba, Pales-\ntine) appointed a cantor, who probably served also as court clerk, to\nsue “the daughters of Isaac ha-Kohen, the butcher,” for having\ntaken possession of a house left to her by her father. This hap-\npened in 1024/5. Whether this was the same house of which Ezekiel\nhad acquired one third twenty years earlier, in 1004, or how those\nwomen could lay their hands on another person’s property, we do\nnot know.'” The document states only that Hasna appeared\n“before the judge and the elders” and, at the end, that her action\nwas confirmed by her husband, as required in all matters affecting\nreal estate.'®\n\nTeenage girls, who were supposed to be, and certainly often\nwere, bashful, were saved the annoyance of making declarations in\npublic. A beautiful example of this is the appointment of a\nmaternal uncle as proxy by two siblings who had come of age, but\nwere still too young to take care of the estate of their father. The\nboy made the appointment in court, after the judge explained to\nhim what the action involved. For the girl several persons, certainly\nacquaintances of the family, two of whom are mentioned by name,\nwere sent to the house, and then, in court, put her declaration on\nrecord.'® The appointment of proxies conducting the financial\narrangements for the conclusion of a marriage usually took place\n\nGoitein, S.

The declaration was\nmade in her place, and the writer, a prominent judge, states that he\nknew the widow. Releases were highly sensitive matters, and were\ntherefore normally enacted in open court.

Thus,\nwith regard to travel, there was a marked difference between the\ntwo sexes, incomparably greater than that still existing in our\nsociety today, and this difference between husband and wife had a\nprofound impact on family life.\n\nYet, the Geniza shows that women did travel for a variety of\nreasons and to a larger extent than we would expect. If married,\nthey were not always accompanied by their husbands. Owing to the\npopulation’s mobility, the extended family became dispersed, a\nsituation that provided many opportunities or pretexts for travel.\nWhat a woman in Fustat, married to a man from Alexandria, could\nface in this respect is reported above: she was obliged to be ready to\nvisit her in-laws in the Mediterranean seaport for one month (but\nnot more) during the course of a year. Thus the couple would pass\nthe month of the High Holidays, which comprised seven days of\ncomplete work stoppage and five half-holidays, with the husband’s\nextended family.\"? These family visits requiring travel, for holi-\ndays and even weekends, formed a conspicuous aspect of social life\nin Geniza times.'\"* Women had to travel unaccompanied by their\nhusbands, and often for prolonged periods, in order to visit a mar-\nried female relative in another town who was either expecting a\nbaby, recuperating after delivery, ill, or suffering by being in an\nunaccustomed or unfriendly environment.'*\n\nAnother common occasion for female travel was a visit to a holy\nshrine, or even to the city of Jerusalem. A detailed statute about the\nfestive days at Dammih, a Jewish sacred place south of Cairo, rules\nthat no woman unaccompanied by a husband, brother, or grown-\nup son was to visit there unless she was “very old.” A statute would\nnot have been needed, had not the women visited there all too\nfrequently.’’®* When a woman is called “the Pilgrim,” I assume it\nwas because she had made the journey to Jerusalem alone, as a\nwidow or otherwise unaccompanied by a husband. For, unlike\nIslam, in Judaism this honorific epithet was not normally applied to\na person who had made the pilgrimage.*'’\n\nIn addition to these commonplace occasions for female travel we\nfind others whose reasons can only be guessed, or about whose cir-\ncumstances we know nothing except that the husband felt helpless\nwithout her (as we would today in like circumstances). “You men-\ntioned that ‘the family’ has gone on a journey.

A\nmore cogent combination of reasons for hurrying home could\nhardly be invented.'*®* When a wife is visiting the writer’s “paternal\nuncle” (i.e., father-in-law) and several other persons are greeted,\nbut not the wife’s mother, we may assume that she was dead, and\nthat the daughter was keeping her father company while her\nhusband, as he writes, enjoyed the visit of another paternal uncle\nover the weekend.\"” The strange condition imposed in the mar-\nriage contract of a widow with two small children, that she was not\npermitted to leave Fustat, seems to show that a young mother\ntraveling away from home was not extraordinary.''\n\nThe kabira, the old lady, or “dowager,” was the female traveler\npar excellence.

The cost of their donkey rides or passages by sea (for many\ncame from Europe) probably was borne by the Jewish communities\nthrough which they passed.\"' But how did they otherwise fare on\ntheir woeful journeys? Anyhow, whether girls proceeded to their\nnew homes overseas, or old women alone were on their way to visit\ntheir progeny, whether wives accompanied their husbands, or went\nup to the capital to sue them, whether a devotee (or seeker of\nadventure) was on a pilgrimage, or a wretched, but determined\npauper on the outlook for relief—the landscape in Geniza times\nwas never completely devoid of women on travel.\n\nAt home.—The household chores of the Geniza women were\napparently not excessively heavy, and left them considerable time\nfor other activities. Grain was stored in the house, but the handmiii,\nthat eternal symbol of female servitude, not long ago so woefully\nprominent in the life, song, and folklore of the women of Yemen, is\npractically absent from the Geniza inventories of household imple-\nments.

Most\nhouseholds comprised more than one female adult, and any\nregular middle class family possessed a maidservant.\n\nThe occupation most frequently referred to in connection with\nwomen was embroidery, and here we should remember that, even\nat the time of our own grandmothers, there was not a single piece\nof household linen or lingerie which was not embroidered or\notherwise embellished. This preoccupation with decorative work\nmust have had a healthy impact on the inner life of women: it made\nfor continuous search for new models, hence, inventiveness, for\ncomparison with the work of others, which entailed sociability, and\nfor pride in one’s own creations, hence, a fecling of success. And\nthere was the soothing effect of steady and quiet work. Embroidery\nwas a luxury, produced by one’s own efforts; it formed the female\ncounterpart to the modest amount of leisure obtained by the\nbourgeois male and used by him for his spiritual and other\npursuits.\n\nThe trousseau lists describe comparatively few items of bedding\nand clothing as embroidered, whereas many hundreds of others\nare noted without this detail. This could mean that the pieces of a\nbride’s outfit bought in the bazaar usually were plain. It was left to\nthe future housewife to adorn her pillows, linen, and personal\nwardrobe in the way she chose. Male clothes, too, could be richly\nembroidered. But the texts seem to indicate that this was done by\nprofessional embroiderers, not by housewives,'**\n\nAs the trousseau lists show, even a middle class bride often\nbrought into the marriage numerous pieces of clothing of the same\ntype; richer girls—quite bewildering quantities. What did they do\nwith them? In those days clothes were not put on hangers; they\nwere kept in beautifully decorated trunks or chests. For the very\npreservation of those pieces it was necessary to take them out from\ntime to time and to expose them to fresh air. On such an occasion,\ncould a woman resist the temptation to try them on one after\nanother, preening before her jeweled mirror (also forming part of\nher bridal outfit), and posing before the other female members of\nthe household or visitors invited for the occasion? I do not mean by\nthis to taunt female vanity.

For this purpose the services of agents and brokers could be\nused, but the Geniza women insisted on their right to do so in\nperson if they wished. While the daily household errands were\ndone by a servant or by the husband, who regularly went to the\nbazaar, the selling and buying of textiles was a pleasurable pastime\nfor the woman of the house, just as shopping is cherished by many\nof the women of our own time.\n\nThere were many other occasions for leaving the house, as is\nevident from the documents dealing with the struggle of the wife\nfor her freedom of movement.

He was so poor that sometimes his brother and\nsometimes his young wife or his mother had to pay the poll tax for\nhim—otherwise he would 'have been thrown into prison. As\nanother indication of his utter penuriousness the letter indicates\nthat he never lighted a lamp for his wife (“not even with linseed, let\nalone with olive 0il”). If she wished to see light, she had to visit the\napartments of her mother, or brother-in-law, who, we remember,\nlived in the same house. A year and a half after the birth of his\nsecond son the man disappeared again and roamed around the\nworld for another three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the young wife had reached the age of twenty-five\nyears. In one respect she had made good use of her loafer of a\nhusband: she had learned from him how to read the Bible, and\nperfected her knowledge during his absence. Her brother, a\nschoolteacher, accepted her as partner, and this arrangement\nlasted six years. Then her brother left town, and she ran the school\nalone for four years, employing her elder boy, who by then was\nseventeen, as her associate. This she did, as the letter is careful to\nstress, “so that.he could talk to the fathers of the schoolchildren,\nwhile she would take care of the mothers.”!\n\nDuring the years she taught school her husband stayed with his\nmother. When he happened to have some money, he would spend\nit on himself and his mother, but never on her and the children.

The idea of a second wife was\npreposterous.\n\nFrom the letter in favor of the husband it becomes evident why\nhe preferred a second wife to a divorce. Naturally, nothing is said\nof his inability or unwillingness to maintain his family. We read\nonly that during his repeated travels (on business, of course) his\nwife became a school mistress, with the result that she had con-\nstantly 0 meet with the fathers of her pupils, which he abhorred,\n“both in his own interest and in hers.” He further complains that\nshe failed to provide him with the services expected from a wife\n(including the conjugal duties) and that she neglected her children.\nHe was unable to divorce her because of her share in the family\nhome; she would “take it with her” and marry another man, where-\nupon his sons might lose their inheritance.\n\nTo this Maimonides replies that the husband was not permitted\nto marry someone else without the consent of his wife. But the\nschool mistress should be instructed by the local judge in the\nstrongest possible terms that the demand of her husband that she\ndesist from teaching was endorsed by the law and therefore could\nnever be a claim for a divorce.’ '\n\nThe answer to the letter in favor of the wife was different in tone\nand empbhasis, but essentially the same in substance. If a husband\ndid not support his wife, he would be forced to set her free and to\npay her the delayed marriage gift. On the other hand, he had the\nright to forbid her to teach, whether a craft or “reading.” The way\nfor her to get free was a declaration that she could not live with\nhim, in which case she would lose her marriage gift (which she had\nlittle prospect of receiving anyway). As a divorcée, Maimonides\nconcludes, “she would have disposition over herself, she could\nteach what she liked and do what she liked.” This sounds as if it was\nnot so much the concern for the teacher’s chastity as the regard for\nher husband’s social susceptibilities which inspired the decision.\nOne must keep in mind, however, that sexual intercourse of an\nunmarried woman, although improper, was not a sin.\n\nThe story of the poor schoolmistress shows how a woman of\nresolution could preserve her independence and provide for\nherself and her children under the most trying circumstances:\nindigence and marriage to an unworthy husband.\n\nA quite different story is that of Karima (“The Dear One”),\ndaughter of ‘Ammar (“Longlived”), known by the name of al-\nWuhsha (“Object of Yearning,” Désirée) the Broker.

The total dowry is noted as\nbeing worth 316 dinars, but an examination of the individual items\nseems to reveal that, at least in part, the estimate is exaggerated.\nThe real value probably was half of the sum listed, about 150\ndinars, which would be proper for a family in easy but by no means\nrich circumstances, which had to provide for three daughters.'**\n\nThe groom, Arye b. Judah, and his marriage gift were even less\nimpressive. He was a stranger in Fustat like al-Wuhsha herself; the\ngift presented at the wedding consisted of only 10 dinars, and that\npromised as delayed installment was not more than 15 dinars,\nwhich shows him to be a man without means.'® Why the match was\nmade, we cannot know.

As her\nconstant nickname “The Broker” indicates, she was a business\nwoman, moving around in the company of men. Poor female\nagents and brokers were common. Well-to-do ones were excep-\ntional. A court record from April 1098 describes how on a Wednes-\nday (when normally no session of the court was held) al-Wuhsha\nwent into the synagogue compound, where she met three men: a\nbeadle, a Bible schoolteacher, and the son of a judge. She told them\nangrily that she had received a summons to the court, because *Ulla\nb. Joseph, the well-known trustee, sued her for a trifling sum. The\nmen, who knew her, understood that a person like al-Wuhsha did\nnot wish to be bothered with such small matters. The court record\nwas made because al-Wuhsha did not honor the summons.'*\n\nAnother court record, dated June 30, 1104, reveals her involve-\nment in a large business venture.

The brother died on the\nvoyage undertaken for that business venture. At the time of the\nlawsuit goods worth 300 dinars had already been sold, and al-\nWuhsha claimed her “share” in them.

The court record\nmakes mention of another venture in which al-Wuhsha partici-\npated, and from which twenty-two camel loads (11,000 pounds)\nhad already arrived.

I know all this for sure, and deposit\nherewith my testimony to this effect.”\n\nThere appeared also in court the ritual slaughterer Aba Sa'id Halfon\nha-Kohen, son of Joseph ha-Kohen—may he rest in Eden—and deposited\nthe following testimony in our presence: “I was living in the house of\nHibat Allah'® Ibn al-Sukkari—may God accept him with favor—on the\nground floor for many years, while al-Wuhsha, the broker, had her\ndomicile in the uppermost part of the house. In those days, she came\ndown once to one of the tenants, namely Aba Nasr, the Kohen, the cantor\nIbn al-Kamukhi,'® and to Abraham the Jerusalemite, known as the son\nof the Murahhit,’® and said to them: ‘Please, come up with me to my place\nfor something.’ The two went up with her and found Hassiin sitting in her\napartment and . . . wine and perfumes. ...\n\nHere the manuscript breaks off. The reader of these two com-\nplementary depositions wonders why al-Wuhsha found it necessary\nto legalize her liaison before a Muslim notary and did not simply\nmarry her paramour Hassiin, since she was a close acquaintance of\nthe scholarly and highly honored Jewish divine Hillel b. EL.\nHassan no doubt had a wife in his hometown Ascalon, and the\nJewish court in Fustat did not permit him to take a second wife\nwithout the permission of the first, and she certainly refused, if\nHassan cared to ask her at all. T suspect, however, that al-Wuhsha\ntold a lie, in order to make her alliance a bit more respectable. For\nhad she contracted a marriage, Hassiin would have taken a big\nchunk of her estate, and, according to Islamic law, a legal heir\ncannot be disinherited. Be that as it may, the most important\ninterest of this record is its social setting. The five men present at\nal-Wuhsha’s appearance and straightforward declaration: the\ncantor, the two witnesses, and two reporters, do not get excited\nabout what they hear (which, of course, they had known before),\ndo not feel induced to ostracize her, and those asked to go up to\nher room are not hesitant to do so. The expulsion of al-Wuhsha\nfrom the synagogue on the Fast of Atonement seemingly was\nagainst the law, since even excommunicated persons are permitted\nto join the community on that day of forgiveness. But the Nasi did\nthe right thing: he wished to demonstrate that even a rich wo-\nman may not permit herself to violate accepted rules of behavior.\nAl-Wuhsha seems to have understood this. In her last will, the\nsynagogue from which she was expelled, that of the Iragians,\nreceives the same donation as the main synagogue, that of the\nPalestinians.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

She, her hushand, and her lover all were strangers in\nFustat. She was unique also in that she appears as a contributor to a\npublic appeal—the only woman in over a hundred such lists. (As is\nto be expected from her, her contribution was of medium size,\nneither stingy, nor particularly generous.)'™ Yet we should not\nregard al-Wuhsha’s case as totally exceptional. She happened to\nlive at a time from which more and better executed documents have\nsurvived than from any other period of the “classical Geniza.” Our\nsurvey of women in economic life has shown that other women\nmight have been as successful and independent as she.

Most of the documentary Geniza consists of\nlegal papers, business correspondence, or family letters of a\npractical nature. One wrote for a purpose, not for the expression\nof thoughts or feelings. For spiritual matters we must consult the\nvast literary treasures preserved in the Geniza which are probably\nmore than ten times as comprehensive as the documentary ones.\nBut, as far as I know them, they are mostly traditional, and, as a\nrule, impersonal.\n\nWomen in Geniza times could become visionaries rousing a\npopular movement, but they were even rarer phenomena than the\nwomen prophets of ancient Israel.'®® Throughout the centuries we\nfind a woman occasionally described as a Nazirite, a person who\nvows to abstain from wine and other intoxicating beverages, which\nin those days must have been a rather trying vow, since bread and\nwine formed the staple food.

Upper\nclass girls, circumstances permitting, certainly received some\nformalinstruction. The twelfth-century author Samuel al-Maghrebi\nrecounts that his mother and her two sisters knew how to read and\nwrite Hebrew and Arabic. Samuel emphasizes writing because even\namong men the art of writing was acquired only by certain classes\nof people.

When Jerusalem was conquered by the Crusaders\non July 15, 1099, not all the Muslims and Jews were slaughtered, as\none reads in the textbooks; the prisoners who were taken and the\nbooks that had been looted had to be ransomed. Ascalon, the south\nPalestinian port, which had remained in Fatimid hands, was where\nthe transactions were made. The Nagid Mevérakh, upon receiving\nthe terrifying news, tore his clothes and sat on the floor, as was\nproper to do at the receipt of such tidings; then he asked his\nvisitors to collect the money needed for the ransom payments in\nAscalon. A first installment was immediately brought together. The\nquestion was how to send the money to Ascalon. The communica-\ntions by land and by sea were in utmost jeopardy, not only because\nof the Franks, but in view of the general anarchy in the Fatimid\nempire caused by the defeat and, in particular, by the devastating\nepidemics that had plagued the country for four years. The school-\nmaster known as “the Son of the Schoolmistress” undertook the\nperilous mission. As the letter addressed to him shows, he was not\nentirely penniless, for a relative asks him for assistance “to get over\nthis hard year.” But we might be right in assuming that Abu\n’I-Mansir volunteered not solely for idealistic reasons. The scribe\nleft the space for the name of Abu ’l-Mansir’s father blank. He\nknew the man solely as “the Son of the Schoolmistress.”**\n\nThe very testimony of Maimonides that the teaching of women\nwas not worth much points to its presence. The story related above\nexemplifies, however, that teaching by women must have been a\ndesperate attempt to gain a livelihood rather than an expression of\nyearning for a higher form of existence.\n\nThe educational gap between male and female was the ultimate\nsource and manifestation of the repression of womanhood in\ncivilized socicties. Only the Western world has overcome this\nobstacle in the advancement of human destinies.

Al-Hakim’s sister,\nSayyidat al-Mulk (“The Mistress over the Kingdom™), was sus-\npected of having engineered his murder and she ruled the country\nafter his death for four years. The Sudanese mother of the caliph\nal-Mustansir (1036—1094), who originally had been a slave girl in\nthe possession of the Jew Abi Sa‘d al-Tustari (who later became\nher “vizier”),” held power while her son was a minor.**” Al-\nMustansir himself, on his deathbed, put the Imamate, the religious\nand temporal leadership of the empire, into the hands of his sister,\nwho then swore allegiance to al-Musta'li, the youngest and there-\nfore, most amenable, of the seven sons of her dead brother.?*® Al-\nMuizz, the most splendorous ruler of Zirid Tunisia (1016—1062),\nwas brought up by his aunt Mallal, also known in the Geniza papers\nas al-Sayyida, “The Mistress,” or “The Ruler,” who acted as regent\nuntil her death in October 1023, and there were other prominent\nwomen of the Zirid court.*®® The role of women at the courts of\neleventh-century Egypt and Tunisia was so conspicuous that Ibn\n‘Idharf, the noted historian of the Muslim West, dedicates a special\nchapter to the topic.**\n\nWomen in public affairs could not escape the attention of the\nsubject population, in particular the circles of the higher govern-\nment officials, physicians in attendance, court purveyors, and\nothers who had direct access to the men in power. These contacts\nwere extended to their womenfolk. When the mother of the Nagid\nand court physician Mevorakh is praised in a dirge for having pla-\ncated the ire of the King, this influence probably was exercised\nthrough the women of the court.?\" In a legal settlement the daugh-\nter of a late government official is warned not to use her relations\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "358 The World of Women viii, D\n\nwith either the government or persons connected with it for im-\npairing the rights of her stepson.”” In a letter from the Ayyubid\nperiod some women are requested to be helpful through their\ngood relations with the wives of some close servants of the\nSultan.?* When the welfare official Eli ha-Kohen (Med., Soc., 11, 78)\nwas in doubt whether he could arrange the marriage of a proselyte\nfreed woman with a Jewish man, he was given a guarantee by the\nmother of Sa‘d al-Mulk (“The Good Star of the Kingdom”) that she\nwould take up the matter for him should any difficulty atise.\nNeedless to say, the two prominent judges who validated her\ndeclaration did so in her home.*\"*\n\nThe influential position of women of the higher class seems not to\nhave been matched by spiritual attainments. Neither the literary nor\nthe documentary Geniza seems to contain a single piece of writing,\nreligious or other, attributable with certainty to a woman. Tens of\nthousands of pieces of liturgical poetry have been preserved in the\nGeniza, but we never hear of a female poet. (A Jewish woman\nwriting Arabic poetry in Spain is known through a Muslim\nsource.)®'® When an encomium says of the wife of a Gaon, a mother\nof six, that “God is pleased with the offering of her songs,” psalms\nfrom the Bible or other prayers are intended, not songs composed\nby her.?’® One may argue that a woman's voice was not to be heard\nin the synagogue. Thus, there was no “seat in life,” no incentive for\nthe creation of a religious poem by a woman. It is also true that the\nmore important families tried to live in Cairo, the residential city,\nfar away from the Geniza chamber. Still, the complete absence\nfrom the Geniza of any spiritual matter created by, or even for,\nwomen cannot be taken lightly. The Arabic and Hebrew folktales\nfound in the Geniza (some of them interesting) are pastimes and\nmostly belong to the international stock of entertainment litera-\nture. Anyhow, most of these tales, as their contents show, cannot be\nclassified as women’s lore.*\"\n\nThus, the inner worlds of men and women certainly were\nseparated from each other. But the gap was not as deep as the\npreceding considerations might induce us to imagine. The spiritual\nconcerns of the men of the Geniza period are studied in Med. Soc.,\n1V. There were certainly learned merchants, highly cultured physi-\ncians, and government officials of refined secular erudition. But\nthe rank and file of men and women alike were consumed by the\npursuit of material gains—tempered by the service of God; com-\nmon interests created many occasions for the meeting of members\nof the opposite sexes and perforce made for similar mentalities. To\nsome extent, women lived in seclusion. But men, too, were secluded.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "viii, D The World of Women 359\n\nA respectable merchant sat in his house or his office in the bazaar,\nwhile brokers and agents did the auctioning and haggling. The\nnobler a woman, the more she had claim to being served by persons\ndoing her errands. But there was no strict segregation. The Jewish\nhouses in Fustat described in the Geniza documents, with few\nexceptions, had no women’s quarters. There was privacy, but no\npurdah.\n\nBeyond the economic meeting ground there was religion which\nbound men and women together. The first prerequisite of a town\nsuitable for a wife to live in was the synagogue. Female attendance\nwas regular. Women conated Torah scrolls for the service, oil and\nbooks for study, and houses for the upkeep of synagogues.?® All\nthis is indicative. There was no God to turn to other than the God of\nmen. The husband was the priest in the house. His officiating at the\nbenedictions before and after a meal and at other ceremonies was\nessential for the spiritual comfort of the female members of the\nhousehold. Milton’s “He for God only, she for God in him” is valid\nalso for the Geniza society.**\n\nThis should not be understood to mean that the woman’s contact\nwith the world was made only through her husband (as assumed\nfor the Athenian wives in the time of Pericles in a recent treatment\nof the subject).?”® Within the world dominated by men there was\nanother one created by the women for themselves. The Geniza\nwomen were of a very sociable nature. They constantly flocked\ntogether, whether in the women’s gallery in the house of worship,\nthe bathhouse, the bazaar, the gatherings on happy or mournful\noccasions, or through the visits of friends and relatives. No wonder\nthat a women, even a young one, could become “dear to the family\nand the town.”?*' The Geniza woman was not the slave of her\nhousehold. She had a life beyond her family.\n\nThe forthcoming fourth and concluding volume of this book\nforms the direct continuation of this one, it complements it, so to\nsay, both from the outside and the inside. Volume IV describes the\ntowns and houses, the clothing and food, and the daily routine of\nthe Geniza people in times normal and abnormal. It also explores\ntheir inner life, their motivations, attitudes, and behavior, as well as\ntheir higher aspirations, as far as they are recognizable in the\nletters and documents that form the source material of this book.\nAfter the family of the Geniza period has been studied in this\nvolume, and its economy and communal life in volumes I and 11,\nthe concluding part is devoted to the individual, his physical\nenvironment and spiritual world.\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "420 Appendix: The Economics of Marriage\n\nSince the poor had more opportunity to leave their family papers with\nthe courts, and hence in the Geniza, than those better off, the actual\neconomic situation of the community might have been somewhat better\nthan indicated by the analysis. But their business letters and contracts\n{Med. Soc., 1. 214-217) indicate that there could not have been much dif-\nference between the picture emerging from the Geniza and reality.\n\nThe lists and the summary are a first attempt at arranging the vast\nGeniza material on the economic aspects of marriage in a semblance of\nstatistics. The pronounced stratification of the society emerging from\nthem is remarkable. Naturally, no claim to completeness is made. The\nmultifarious realities of the economics of marriage must be studied in the\n\nlight of the entire material presented in this volume.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "Notes\n\nCHAPTER VIII: The Family\n\nA. “THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER”: THE EXTENDED FAMILY\nIntroduction\n\n\"Thus in the old Palestinian marriage contracts: bhth, ENA 4010, f. 36 + PER H\n1, Tyre, 1079, ed. Friedman, Marriage, no. 11.\n\n*The usual designation for the extended family is bayt, “house,” taking the strange\nform baytat when combined with a name, for instance, baytat al-dayyan, “the House\nof the Judge” (TS K 15, f. 63v, 1. 1) and so throughout the superscriptions of the\npedigrees of twenty Karaite families (Mann, Texts, 11, 257—283). Occasionally,\nbayta is used unconnected with a name. Thus a grandfather is described as nir\nal-bayta, “the light of the [extended] family” (TS 20.174v, 1. 15). Equally common is\nthe term ‘itra, popular perhaps at that time because the dynasty ruling Egypt was\nreferred to thus. For instance, ‘itrat al-Ghuzitli (Maker of Fishnets) (TS K 15, f. 27)\nor in the genealogy of Maimonides in Mann, 11, 319, and others edited there,\npp- 282 and 318.\n\nAlthough only men appear in the genealogies of the memorial lists, the women,\ntoo, belonged, of course, to the ‘itra. Thus a woman writes of a relative: “She is\nthe only one in the ‘itra who has preserved feelings of family attachment (hanin)\"\n(TS 13 J 21, f. 18, margin).\n\nAlternately with bayt, the synonym dar was used. “You spoke in your letter about\nyour marriage into the house, dir, of the Kohen. I was very happy about this; for\nthere is no family, bayt, in Egypt better than this” (TS 13 J 16, £. 7, 1. 7-8;\nNahray 47).\n\nOccasionally, the term ‘ashira, clan, tribe, is introduced, when one wishes to\nemphasize the extended family over the smaller one. “All close and distant rela-\ntives of hers should stop this,” an yazil kull min ahl-hd wa-min ‘ashirat-hd (ENA\n4011, £. 17).\n\nA man's nuclear family and his wife are referred to as ah! (the ancient Semitic\nword for “tent”), and often it is not evident whether the wife or the family is meant.\n\nThe word most commonly used today, ‘d’ila, has retained in the Geniza its original\nsense of “dependents,” “household.” E.g., TS 18 J 3, f. 5: ‘abd-ha f7 ‘ashara min\nal-'@’ila, “your servant’s household comprises ten dependents.”\n\n*Heb. ba‘alé batiim is probably influenced by Ar. ahl al-buyit, see TS 12,146,\n1. 24; Mann, Texts, I, 190; TS 10J 13,113, 1. 12; TS 13 J 21, . 5, 1. 25%; see also\nA, 3, n. 68.\n\n1.

Soc., 11, 163 and 554 nn. 28—31.

The editor, who was not\naware of the repetition of the names in the family, had great difficulty in placing\nthe document chronologically.\n\n**Mann, II, 102 and passim.\n\n#“They cannot be his sons, as one of them was called Joseph, and Judah's\nfather was still alive” (Mann, Texts, 1, 116 n. 15).\n\n*Dropsie 332, ed. Schechter, Saadyana, pp. 23—26, who omits, however, the\ndetailed Arabic address, from which the information provided by me is derived.\n“Grandfather” translates Heb. zegénkhem, but it is not excluded that Saadya may\nhave used the word in the sense of Ar. shaykh, where it may also mean “father.”\nBut the letter is addressed “to the store of ‘Ali b. Sulayman” and the Gaon writes\nto the three sons because they had been his beloved students. In any case, Sulayman\nI1 was the firstborn.\n\n*Judah ha-Levi, Diwan, ed. H. Brody (Berlin, 1894), 11, 171.\n\n2*Midrash Bamidbar Rabba, chap. 12, sec. 10, shows that it must have been\nancient Jewish usage to call a beloved little daughter “Mom”: I5 zaz méhabbevah ‘ad\nshe-qara otah imma.\n\n2BT, Bava Mesi‘a 85a. See also Proverbs 17:6.\n\nTS 12.425*%. See C, 2, n. 6, below.\n\n\"The repetition of names in the kingly houses of Ghassan, who were Christians\nand attached to the Byzantine Empire, and of Lakhm, who ruled over the Christian\ntown of Hira and were vassals of the Sasanid kings, probably was an imitation of\nthe ruling houses which they served.\n\n*Leopold Zunz, Namen der Juden (Lepizig, 1837; Hildesheim, 1971), pp. 36—37.\nLeopold Léw, Beitraege zur juedischen Altertumskunde, Vol. 11 (Szeged, 1875), p. 94.\nThe name Onias (H6nyd), for instance, recurs six times in the genealogy of the\nhigh priests of Jerusalem (later in Egypt). Similarly, the lineage of the heads of\nthe medieval Karaite community, who derived their origin from the kingly house\nof Judah, contains the name David five times, Joshiah four times, Solomon three,\nas well as the names of seven other members of the house of David (see Mann,\n11, 215).\n\n*3Simeon’s role in the Bible was insignificant and negative. But since it sounded\nlike Simon, a genuinely Greek name, it was popular among Jews in Hellenic times. It\nis extremely common in the Talmud, but not in the Geniza. Sam‘an (or Sim‘an),\nequally rare in the Geniza, is a genuine Arabic name.\n\n*Oriental Institute, Chicago, no. 10552, ed. N. Abbott, ZDMG, 95 (1941), 60—65.\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that in this, as in other matters, the con-\nsistency of the Geniza people was by no means strict. I believe that at least half\nthe people whose grandfathers are known to us did not bear the latters’ names.\nIt could be argued, of course, that in all these cases the persons concerned were\nnot first sons. But that assumption is unlikely. Edgar R. Samuel (“New Light on\nthe Selection of Jewish Children’s Names,” Transactions of the fewish Historical\nSociety of England, 23 [1971], 65) states with regard to “Portuguese” Jews of Am-\nsterdam, London, and elsewhere: “The patterns of choosing names is rigidly pre-\nscribed; the first son is named after his paternal grandfather.” It is interesting\nthat the custom traced in the Geniza is still observed by the descendants of the\nJews expelled from Spain and Portugal about five hundred years ago. But con-\nsistency was not a characteristic of the Geniza people. I owe the reference to\nDr. S. C. Reif of Cambridge University.\n\n*BT Gittin 846—85a.\n\n*\"The one case where “Lion” is rendered by Hebrew Arye was that of a man from\nPalermo, probably an Italian Jew: TS 8 J 5, f. 16, dated 1095.\n\nTS 24.73, dated 1047, ed.

The sum of 84 dinars\nassumes an exchange rate of 1 dinar = 24 zaz (85 X 24 = 200).\n\n#See C, 1 and C, 3, below. Cases where the early installment of the marriage gift\nwas larger than the delayed one are extremely exceptional and are traceable 10\nspecial circumstances, e.g., ENA 2779, f. 3, Friedman, Marriage, no. 25 (11 + 3\ndinars) where the early installment was used for buying the bride’s outfit. TS\n12.659, ibid., no. 6 (20 + 8, interpretation doubtful). These are ancient Palestinian\nketubbas. I also have doubts about similar cases from the Mamluk period, where an\nearly installment of 50 dinars seems to have been standard for a certain class of\npeople. When, as in TS 24.8, the dowry was large, or in TS Misc. Box 28, f. 217, ed.\nStrauss-Ashtor, Mamluks, 111, 72, worth 500 dinars, an early instalilment of 50 dinars\nseems reasonable. But when, as in TS Misc. Box 28, f. 26, ed. ibid., p. 77, the\ndaughter of a synagogue beadle, who had no dowry at all, receives 50 dinars as\nwedding gift at her second marriage, some face-saving or other special circum-\nstances must have been involved, for instance, that the money was given to her in\norder to buy the outfit, which her father was unable to provide. A similar circum-\nstance seemingly in TS Misc. Box 8, f. 87 (a legal opinion).\n\n2*Wedding gifts of 6 or 7 dinars were exceptional. [ have not found any of 8 or 9\ndinars.

In TS 8 J 9, . 9, L. 11, written a short time before Halfon’s activi-\nties, the details appear in reverse order: “She is trustworthy in the management\nof the house and in her statements...,” puiting the deeds before the words.\n\nTS 8 ] 5, £. 2¢-d (April 1132), see App., part I, group 5, no. 35.\n\nTS NS Box 226, f. 11, 1. 4 (Dec. 1119), see App., part I, group 5, no. 16.\n\nPENA 18224, f. 60. The note is of extreme brevity and therefore somewhat\ncryptic for us: “My lady, Sitt Salaf visited me and reported to me what you have said\nto her. Now, my lady, I have children; so if you deem fit that he {or: it) should be\nleft in my engagement agreement, it is fine with me; but if you transfer him (or:\nit) for me to someone else, you would do me a great favor. 1 am also trustworthy etc.\nin this matter. So, if you will do this for me, your action will be highly appreciated.”\nThe mysterious “he (or: it)” could have been a male slave who had become the\nproperty of the widow with children in payment of what was due her after the death\nof her husband. For reasons of propriety he was admitted to the household of “the\nLady,” who suggested to include him in the dowry the widow would bring into her\nnew marriage. But she preferred cash, since a male slave was high-priced, but oflittle\npractical value to her and her children. The transfer of the proprietorship of a slave\nwas a delicate matter; therefore the widow emphasizes that in her first marriage she\nhad been granted complete trustworthiness and no one could contest her property\nrights. Whatever the story behind this little note may have been, the emphasis on the\nprivilege of “trustworthiness” is noteworthy. Sitt Salaf, “Lady Inaccessible,” ap-\npears also in Med. Soc., 11, 432, sec. 162 (thirteenth century), but our note seems to\nbelong to the eleventh century.\n\nTS NS ] 287. See B, 4, n. 82, above.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Boocock, “The Social Context of Chi.d-\nhood,” Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 119 [1975], p. 425).\n\nThe father of my great-grandmother, Hinle(in) Kohn (1803 1880), had eight\nsons and seven daughters from his wife Zierle, ali but one of whom survived him\n(the exception died of a contagious disease at the age of twenty-six). Hinle was a\npious and wealthy man, who spent his whole life in the small Bavarian town in\nwhich he and all his known ancestors had been born—a typical example of a\nnineteenth-century bourgeois family. I owe the details to an unpublished book on\nthe family by Dr. Jean Kohn of Paris.

As a rule, at least in Fustat, the introduction was\ninformal, not requiring “two trustworthy witnesses,” and could be made by one\nperson, even a close relative, who otherwise was legally disqualified to testify, as\nwhen one record states: “This widow was introduced to us by her son so-and-so”\n(TS 12,618, 1. 22, frag.). When the energetic orphan ‘Ama'im, who at her marriage\nhad acted on her own, a few years later made an agreement with her husband, she\nwas “made known” to the judge by a single man (whose relationship to her is not\nindicated). The same judge, incidentally, presided on both occasions (Bodl. MS\nHeb. a 3 [Cat. 2873), I. 40v, Il. 12—14, see C, 1, n. 131, above).

Such scholarship as his is, in Lord Acton’s phrase, ‘not a\nburden on the memory but an illumination of the soul.”\nGeorge Kirk, Muslim World\n\n“A significant contribution to our knowledge of the private and communal life of medieval\nNear Eastern Jews as well as of Christians and Muslims with whom they lived in the closest\nproximity.”\n\nFrank Rosenthal, American Historical Review\n\n“The work, though based on primary research and likely to influence the whole field for\ndecades . . . is always readable and at times entertaining.”\nThe Times (London)\n\n“Goitein’s perceptive study not only lights up the economic, social, and religious life of the\nJews in the Islamic World, buc also illuminates the Christian and Islamic communities,\ngiving us new insights and broader horizons. The work is remarkable for its sheer magni-\ntude, but more particularly for the humane sensibility and imagination, the skill, and the\nformidable learning thac it reflects.”\n\nThe Haskins Medal Committee\n\n“This is a most readable book. . . . A new vista of research has opened for the student\nof history of Mediterranean countries during the Middle Ages. . . . An outstanding\naccomplishment.”\n\nHarry Poppers, American Historical Review\n\n“A truly remarkable achievement. . . . When we consider that [previously] consulting Geniza\nmaterials was possible only for the learned few, we may measure the debt we all owe Goitein.\n. .. Given the exceptional importance of the Geniza and the unusual difficulties posed by its\ncontents, we understand how much we have been given.”\nJacob Newsner, Journal of the Academy of Religion\n\n$.D.

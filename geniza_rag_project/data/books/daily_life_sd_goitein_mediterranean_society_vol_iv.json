        "text": "Preface\n\nThe history of material civilization, of the things surrounding\nman day in day out and requiring his attention willy-nilly, has\nbecome a special branch of medievalist research. Called Sachkulturin\nGerman, culture as expressed in matter, it forms part and parcel of\nsocial history, since the relationship between man and object is apt to\nreveal much about man himself (for a note on Sachkultur see p. 270).\nGenerations of students of classical antiquity have worked on this\nsubject: With regard to the Middle Ages, however, when the empha-\nsis was on religion and on all that was connected with it in one way or\nanother, it was felt that material civilization had been somewhat\nneglected or, at least, had not been treated specifically and system-\natically enough, and that the time had come to remedy the situation.\n\nI had a similar experience with my study of the letters and\ndocuments of the so-called Cairo Geniza, materials that originated\nmostly among Jews living in the Muslim countries of the Mediter-\nranean area (and along the India route) during the tenth through\nthe thirteenth centuries. Planning to draw a comprehensive picture\nof the society encountered in that marvelous treasure trove of\nmanuscripts, I described its economic foundations and its com-\nmunal and family life in the first three volumes of this work. I\nintended to conclude with a portrait of the individual—his physical\nenvironment and spiritual world. The idea was to give the latter the\nlion’s share and to keep the former as brief as feasible.\n\nYet, the more my work progressed, the more doubtful it became\nthat the proportion was right, that it reflected faithfully what really\noccupied the mind of the Geniza person. His letters deal almost\nexclusively with practical matters and physical objects. It should not\nbe argued that the vast majority of writings preserved in the Geniza\nwere books (or, rather, remnants of books), which might reflect a\nsociety predominantly interested in learning. Most of these writings\nwere either professional and specialist texts as in our own libraries,\nor biblical and liturgical ones used at the synogogue service, or for\npopular study, “adult courses,” which also were a kind of worship.\n\nOne should not jump to the conclusion (as some are apparently\ninclined to do) that medieval man was not really as religious and\n\nGoitein, S.

Suffice it to\nstate here that God is mentioned in Geniza letters as frequently as\nthe doliar is elsewhere; that the Geniza person’s day, week, and year\nwere punctuated and regulated by religion; and that it also provided\nhim with well-integrated beliefs and moral principles, which were\nconducive to good mental health, albeit not always honored by\ncompliance. Add to it that not only Jews, but also medieval Muslims\nand Eastern Christians, knew that their station in society depended\nlargely on the particular sect, denomination, rite, or “school” to\nwhich they belonged. In short, religion was present everywhere, but\none gets the impression that, with the exception of the few really\npious and God-possessed, religion formed the frame rather than the\ncontent of the daily existence.\n\nConsequently, if we wish to know the Geniza person’s life, we\nmust stroll with him through his beloved native town, which was his\nwatan, or home (the town, not a country or state with constantly\nchanging borders); we must visit his house, which, together with\neverything in it, differed so completely from ours. His clothing,\nespecially his outerwear, received his meticulous attention, for it\nidentified him, it showed the world who he was; the jewelry of the\nwomenfolk was a matter of utmost concern for a variety of reasons,\nin particular as a means of protection of female economic indepen-\ndence; mounts, like clothing, could be status symbols, somehow\nsimilar to our cars. For the pleasures of the table the Geniza is not a\ngood source; for, unlike ourselves, but almost like our grand-\nparents, the Geniza people regarded speaking about food as bad\nmanners. My chapter about the subject is, I am afraid, somewhat\nlopsided with emphasis on bread and wine, the basic diet of ancient\nand early medieval common man.\n\nThe study of material civilization became for me a real voyage of\ndiscovery. Originaily, it was forced upon me by the necessity of\ntrying to identify the countless objects mentioned in the Geniza, and\nto understand their place in life and their value in money and\nprestige. This undertaking required much toil, but was unavoid-\nable; for without knowing what people were talking about, it was\nhazardous to assess their psyche and attitudes.\n\nMy labors were well rewarded. Every object seemed to tell a story\nor at least to pose a problem. The minutiae of daily life often\nreflected great historical processes or intricate situations. During the\nhigh-strung and bigoted Late Middle Ages, we are told, men re-\ngarded themselves as citizens of the quarters into which they had\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In Fatimid and early\nAyyubid times houses of Muslims, Christians, and Jews bordered on\none another and, as the Geniza shows, their inhabitants felt them-\nselves strongly as belonging to the larger unit, the town. Tables,\nchairs, and beds were in use by the ancient Egyptians, Israelites,\nGreeks, and Romans, but had totally disappeared by the middle of\nthe eleventh century together with the concepts of dining room or\nbedroom. This tremendous change might have been attributable\npartly to the progressive deforestation of the area with the resulting\nshortage of timber and partly to its domination by a race of desert\ndwellers and pastoral peoples, who made use of textiles instead of\nwood for comfort. As in spiritual matters, by the turn of the eleventh\ncentury the heritage of Late Antiquity had either been digested in\nthe Middle East or relinquished. The fantastic development of\ntextiles with their precious fabrics and gorgeous colors for seating,\nbedding, carpets, and hangings (as well as for clothing, of course)\nwas due to these changes.\n\nThe familiar process of the seeping down of luxurious ways of the\nruling class to lower layers of the society is often to be observed in\nour documents. Textiles that had once been the prerogative of the\nSassanid kings of Persia and their successors, the Abbasid caliphs,\nbecame almost a convention for middle-class brides, naturally, in\ncheap varieties or imitations. The very architecture of the house and\nthe arrangement of the furnishings in it seem to have followed royal\nexamples. “A house without a large hall is not a house.” The spa-\ncious majlis, literally, sitting room, which provided a gathering place\nfor the extended family and its friends, seems to have been modeled,\nboth in its relative size and in the distribution of seating facilities,\ncarpets, and hangings, on the archetype of a caliphal palace. The\ncolorful pillows and cushions, “destined to give the house the look of\na garden,” as well as the equally gay covers of the benches on which\none was seated, occupied a prominent place in the trousseau of any\nbride with some means.\n\nAnother instance of seeping down was the adoption by the gen-\neral populace of a custom cherished by an elite circle, in the process\nof which its original significance got lost. In the thirteenth century\nand later, Arabic manuscript illustrations show persons, high and\nlow, female and male, wearing decorative stripes on the upper part\nof their sleeves, embroidered with writing, imitations of writing, or\notherwise. This custom is well documented in the Geniza, so much\nso that a large order for clothing indicates for each type whether or\nnot it should have writing. One is reminded of poetry-loving Bagh-\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Soap was used for\nwashing clothes; the human body was cleaned with an alkaloid\nsubstance, which, as we learn from a literary source, was recom-\nmended to the Arab conquerors by the more sophisticated Persians.\nIn the Geniza, the receptacle containing this substance is regularly\nincluded in trousseau lists. (It had to be tightly closed lest the scented\nmaterial lose its fragrance.) The substance itself was already used in\nclassical antiquity and is also known from the Talmud, that vast\nrepository of postbiblical Jewish writings. The Talmud is often\nquoted in this volume because it demonstrates the large extent to\nwhich the material civilization of the Greeks and Romans had been\nabsorbed by the Middle East before the advent of Islam.\n\nIn the course of the thirty years or so during which I have studied\nthe life of the Geniza people, I have somehow come to know the\nsubjects about which they talked when they came together. In this\nvolume, a representative portion of them is communicated to the\nreader in the numerous summaries and translations, partial or full,\nprovided in the text and appendixes. In problematic cases more\nthan one example is given in order to enable the reader to judge for\nhimself. In the very process of discussing an object, its identity, use,\nand significance become revealed.\n\nI cannot produce any illustrations because by their very nature\nthe Geniza documents contain none.

        "text": "Preface xv\n\nagain: “Be as precise and detailed as possible; you cannot know what\nwill be of interest for the readers. Let the Geniza speak for itself and\nprepare the avenues which may guide future research.” I faithfully\nfollowed his advice, but only up to a certain point. For I am confident\nthat the topics treated in this volume will be taken up by scholars\nspecifically engaged in the study of material civilization, as has\nalready been done so successfully by Moshe Gil for housing and\nYedida K. Stillman for clothing (see Abbreviations). [ tried to keep\nthis book within the limits of its stated purpose: a chapter of social\nhistory.’\n\nA word must be said about the Arabic language used in the\nGeniza documents. This medieval Arabic is neither the written\nclassical language nor the modern vernacular, but something in\nbetween. Despite the admirable work done in Arabic lexicography\nboth by medieval Muslim authors and modern scholars it became\nsoon clear to me that the vocabulary of the Geniza documents was\nonly imperfectly registered elsewhere. This was natural. The letters\nand documents of the Cairo Geniza were written mostly by members\nof the middle class; just as the medieval chronicler had little oppor-\ntunity to pay attention to that segment of mankind, so the lexicogra-\npher, lacking sufficient written sources describing those people, was\nnot in a position to leave us complete lists of the things used by them\nin daily life.\n\nIn order to avoid misunderstanding, I hasten to add that Middle\nArabic, as that medieval Arabic'is now called, was spoken by Mus-\nlims, Christians, and Jews alike. Jews wrote it mostly in Hebrew\ncharacters, which they had learned in school, and also used Hebrew\nphrases when speaking about matters of religion, in blessings, titles,\nand the like, and, of course, in quotations from the Bible and\npostbiblical literature. But things were always expressed in Arabic.\nEven in letters and documents written in the Hebrew language,\nobjects went by their Arabic terms, and for a very simple reason:\nthey were the terms one had to use when going to the bazaar to buy\nand to sell. The conclusion of subsection B, pp. 193—200, shows\nthat, in Fatimid times, Jewish clothing did not differ essentially from\nthat of the general population.\n\nHow, then, was one to go about knowing the things with which\nthe Geniza people lived? One had to resort to the method already\nadopted by the ancient commentators of Alexandria, namely, “ex-\nplaining Homer through Homer,” collecting as many instances as\nfeasible of the occurrence of an object and noting whatever one\ncould learn about its use, price, relationship to other objects men-\ntioned together with it, and so forth.\n\nGoitein, S.

        "text": "xvi Preface\n\nThis type of research is known as philology. I am well aware of the\nfact that nowadays nothing more disparaging could be said of a\nhistorian than that he is a philologist. But we are doing spadework\nhere, and this cannot be done without a spade.\n\nAnother matter is, of course, how much of this labor should be\nshared by the user of this book. The reader is the author’s guest. He\nshould be at the table, being served, not stand with him in the\nkitchen watching him cook. But I must reiterate that my endeavor is\nto let the reader listen to the Geniza people’s talk. By participating in\nthe process of inquiry into the meaning of a term, one becomes\nfamiliar with the object itself.\n\nMy original plan was to include the material presented here in the\nfirst volume of this book. The sections herein on the city, domestic\narchitecture, and socioeconomic aspects of housing were already\ntyped by the middle of the 1970s. But I soon realized that I had not\ndone enough homework and that the significance of the things of\ndaily life would become more apparent after the social aspects,\nnamely, communal and family life, had been treated. Thus,\nHorace’s nonumgque prematur in annum (let it be kept quiet till the\nninth year) was more than fully observed. I do not regret the delay.\nNot only has my factual knowledge largely expanded during this\nlong period, but my education, I mean my understanding of and\nfeeling for social phenomena and processes, has been much en-\nhanced through my contact with contemporary scholarship. Thus I\nhope that the late appearance of this volume has benefited it,\nalthough I am only too well aware of its shortcomings.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nAs in the previous volumes, it is my pleasant duty to express my\nsincere thanks to the librarians and staffs of the libraries whose\nmanuscripts have been used. Unlike the previous volumes, this one\ndid not necessitate new visits. All material had been collected in the\npreceding decades, although the process of deciphering and identi-\nfying went on unabated. But whenever I take a photostat into my\nhands I feel how much I owe to the guardians of those treasures,\nwho toiled so much to preserve and ready them for the use of the\nstudent.\n\nI wish to reiterate here my appreciation of the assistance received\nfrom the late Egyptian archaeologist, Ahmad Fakhri, whose guid-\nance on the subjects treated in this volume was most valuable. [ am\ngrateful to Professor Bernard Lewis and Professor Eva Baer for\ntheir useful observations. I am particularly indebted to Dr. Marilyn\n\nGoitein, S. D.

My new assistant,\nPaula Sanders, a gifted and conscientious young scholar, contrib-\nuted much to the smooth progress of my work. And, as with the\npreceding volume, Sandra S. Lafferty’s painstaking and beautiful\ntyping was a great help. I regard it as a stroke of luck that Mrs.\nTeresa Joseph, who had edited the first three volumes of this work,\nwas able to watch over the preparation of this volume as well. I am\nconfident that the reader will join me in my feelings of gratitude for\nthe fruits of her labor.\n\nLast, but not least, my deep-felt thanks go to Dr. Harry Woolf, the\ndirector, and to the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study,\nPrinceton, as well as to Dr. Harry Starr, the president, and to the\nboard of the Luscius N. Littauer Foundation for their continuous\nsupport of the Geniza project.\n\nI cannot conclude this Preface without commemorating my\nformer student and later collaborator of many years in the work of\nthe Geniza, Dr. Gershon Weiss, professor of Hebrew at Temple\nUniversity, Philadelphia. He, a sturdy young man of forty-six, a\nfather of three, died of cancer on October 15, 1981.

In the eleventh century we still—or should we say:\nagain—find merchants from Iraq and Iran active and also settling in\nthe Mediterranean area. But practically no travelers moving in the\nopposite direction have left records, or are mentioned, in the Geniza\npapers. The eastward movement turned to the India route via\nUpper Egypt and the Red Sea.®\n\nThere was continuous coming and going between Egypt and the\nport cities of Spain, Sicily, Tunisia, and Libya in the west, and the\ntowns of Palestine and Greater Syria in the east. Our main informa-\ntion about urban life is derived from Egypt itself and, in particular,\nits ancient Islamic capital, Fustat (Old Cairo), where the Geniza\npapers were found. Allin all, it is the Islamic city of the Middle Ages\nwhich is reflected in our documents.\n\nAs far as I know, the Swiss Arabist Adam Mez made the first\ncomparative study of the “Muhammedan” city, as he called it, in a\npaper published in 1912.° Mez did not wish to imply that there\nexisted a uniform type of Islamic city or that it was Islam that created\nit. Quite the contrary. He differentiates among four original types\nof town: Arabian (characterized by its multistoried buildings and\nnarrow streets, and represented by the towns of South Arabia,\nMecca, and Fustat?), Hellenistic-Mediterranean, Mesopotamian,\nand Iranian. To them was added from the third Islamic century a\nfifth type, the spacious imperial garden city, realized, for instance, in\nthe Fatimid foundation of Cairo. In general, Mez emphasizes that\nthe fully developed Islamic city represented a reemergence of the\nancient Near Eastern city. Mez's main purpose was to show what the\nMuslims themselves said, or omitted to say, about their multifarious\nurban conglomerations; his interest was not theoretical. I have sum-\nmarized his paper because certain aspects of the problem which\nhave been vividly discussed of late, such as the question of continuity\nor new creation and the role of religion versus local tradition, were\nalready broached in that early treatment of the subject, which shows\nthat they are inherent in its very nature.\n\nA comprehensive and systematic survey of recent research done\nin this field is contained in a study by the German geographer Eugen\nWirth entitled “The Oriental City: A Survey Based on Recent Publi-\ncations on Material Civilization.”® By “Oriental” Wirth means the\nmedieval Islamic city, which he, like Mez, regards as a continuation\n\nGoitein, S.

The really new creation of the\nmedieval Near Eastern city was the bazaar, according to him an\nabsolutely novel and unique topographic and socioeconomic phe-\nnomenon, to which he dedicated a most extensive study, both\ndescriptive and speculative.®\n\nAn entirely different type of summary of all that is known about\nthe Islamic city is represented in Oleg Grabar’s chapter “Cities and\nCitizens” in the magnificent volume The World of Islam, edited by\nBernard Lewis. As the title indicates, the approach of the eminent\nart historian and Islamist is sociological, but it is so in the widest sense\nof the word, inclusive of the physical, economic, political, religious,\nand cultural aspects involved. The author’s personal stance\nand original contribution to the problems discussed are clearly\nindicated.\"\n\nThe Islamic city seemingly differed from both the Greek-Roman\nand the medieval European cities by its lack of a municipal organiza-\ntion. The historian is bound to try to explain this seeming difference\nand to inquire what, instead, kept Islamic urban society together and\nhow did the individual resident relate, legally and emotionally, to\nthe town in which he lived. In search for answers to these questions\nmany other aspects of city life must be considered.\n\nFrench scholars have been leading in the research on Islamic\nurbanism through the painstaking study of individual cities on one\nhand and by attempts at generalization and characterization on the\nother. Outstanding examples of the first type are Jean Sauvaget’s\nclassic on Aleppo, Syria (historical and archaeological), Roger Le\nTourneau’s work on Fez and the cities of North Africa in general\n(socioeconomic), and André Raymond’s quantitative and demo-\ngraphic studies on Cairo of the eighteenth century, which also shed\nlight on the previous history of the city.\"!\n\nImpressed by the religious fervor prevailing in the cities of North\nAfrica during the first half of this century and the manifold corpo-\nrative formations found in them, French scholars, and above all the\nformer doyen of French [slamists, Louis Massignon, projected this\nimage into the past. They concluded that Islamic religion created\nthe character of the medieval Middle Eastern town, including its\nphysical layout, whereas guilds of artisans and merchants, as well as\nbrotherhoods of scholars and mystics, provided the nuclei that kept\nsociety from falling apart.

A modest share in this development\nis also attributable to Geniza research, which has demonstrated that\ncommerce and industry in those times and places were based on free\ncooperation and partnerships on the one hand and government\ncontrol on the other.* Discussions on the medieval city of the Middle\nEast are now being held on an international plane.\n\nThe proceedings of several conferences dedicated to the subject\nhave already appeared in print. The Oxford colloquium of summer\n1965, presided over by Albert H. Hourani and S. M.

Lapidus, con-\nceived of the Islamic city as a link between the ancient and the\nmodern Middle East. The Princeton conference of April 1970,\nchaired by L.

The geographer X. de Planhol writes: “The urban ideal of\nIslam created no forms, no urban structure. ... It replaced the\nsolidarity of a collective community [as in classical antiquity] with an\nanomalous disorganized heap of disparate quarters and elements.\nBy a really very remarkable paradox, this religion endowed with the\nideal of urban life produced the very negation of urban order.”*\nIn the same volume. Claude Cahen has this to say:\n\nThe town as such is unknown in Islamic law. It does not possess the\nindividuality either of the ancient city or of the Western commune of the\nlater Middle Ages. However, this distinction must not be misinterpreted or\nattributed to Islam. The Muslim town naturally took its place in continuity\nwith the town of late antiquity, which, against the background of empires\nthat became more and more centralized, had lost almost all autonomy: and\nthe European communes came into being in under-organized states, a thing,\nwhich, by comparison, the medieval Muslim world had never been. Gen-\nerally speaking, true urban autonomies would have been unthinkable in that\nworld, but. .. it does not follow that the towns formed amorphous and\npassive communities.’?\n\nIn reality, it appears to me that these contradicting statements are\nmatters of approach and evaluation rather than of substance and\nfacts. A certain consensus on the general nature of the medieval\nNear Eastern cities seems to have emerged. The medieval Islamic\ncity was a place where one lived, not a corporation to which one\nbelonged. There were town dwellers, but no citizens in the legal\nsense of the word, for there did not exist a municipality that made\nlaws and under whose jurisdiction one could come. It was not,\nhowever, Islam that destroyed the corporate institutions of the\nGreeks and Romans. These had decayed or disappeared long be-\nfore the Arab conquest. Obviously, in later antiquity, the cities had\nbecome too big for the primitive democratic institutions developed\nin classical times. The management of these unwieldy conglomera-\ntions had to be entrusted to managers, to administrators appointed\nby the government. The assertion that, in early Islam, corporate life\nfound a refuge in the guilds of artisans and merchants, although\nreiterated with strong emphasis by some scholars, cannot be upheld,\nfor these guilds, as far as this term may be applied to them at all,\ndeveloped only during the Late Middle Ages. In the cities of Syria\nand Iraq, rudiments of urban autonomy are discernible, particularly\nin the formation of local militia forces.

The role of the ulama, or religious scholars, as a cohesive force\nwithin the urban amalgam is still being much discussed (see below).\nDespite their organizational weakness, however, the Islamic cities\nrepresented effective social realities. As seats of the government or\nof its representatives they guaranteed relative security; as local mar-\nkets or international emporiums they provided economic oppor-\ntunities; and with their mosques and madrasas, their churches,\nsynagogues, and schools, their bathhouses and other amenities they\ncontained all a man needed for leading a religious and cultured life.\nIt is true: cities as such did not make laws. But neither, as a rule, did\nthe medieval Muslim governments. Yet both were most tangible\nfactors in everyone's life.\n\nIt was in this environment that the Geniza people, those invet-\nerate city dwellers, were found. Urban life is necessarily reflected in\neverything they wrote.\n\nCapitals and port cities.—In rural societies the towns grew out of\nthe land. Their growth was mostly slow and intermittent. In Arabic\nIslam, a society originally of long-distance traders and bedouins, the\nprocess was reversed. The cities preceded the countryside, so to\nspeak. They were founded and filled with populace immediately\nafter, or evenin the course of, the conquest and formed the nucleiof\nArabization. There, Arabic and Islam were soon predominant,\nwhereas in the countryside it took hundreds of years for the religion,\nthe language, and the social traditions of the conquerors to be\nassimilated. Consequently, it was natural that the capital of a country\nor district be identified in terms of the region that it dominated. The\nregion, as it were, was subsumed in its capital.\n\nThroughout the Geniza papers, Fustat is called Misr (Egypt,\nprobably pronounced Masr then as now). Only in legal documents is\nFustat Misr (Fustat of Egypt) used to differentiate it from the newly\nfounded sister city Cairo.'® Damascus is referred to as Sham (Land of\nthe North, Syria), but often also by its old name Dimashq,\"? certainly\nbecause Syria contained other ancient cities conquered and imme-\ndiately occupied by the Arabs after the conquest. In diyar Halab\nwa-diyar Antakiya (Aleppo and Antioch [both in northern Syria]\nwith their surroundings) the district is defined by its capital city.2\nPalermo, the capital of Sicily, is usually called Siqilliya, Sicily\n(often spelled with s), occasionally Madinat Sigilliya, The City of\nSicily, sometimes shortened to al-Madina, The City (which the un-\ninitiated reader of Geniza letters should not take as Medina in\nArabia), whereas Balarm, the Arabic equivalent of Palermo, is\nnearly absent.”*\n\nGoitein, S.

Under Islam, the cities chosen\nor founded as capitals—Fustat, Ramle of Palestine, Damascus, and\nQayrawan of Tunisia—were situated inland, where they were safe\nfrom surprise attacks of the Byzantine and other Christian navies.\nThe main ports of a country, such as Alexandria, Tyre on the\nLebanese coast, or al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, were regarded as frontier\nfortresses. Alexandria is often referred to in the Geniza letters as\nal-thaghr, the frontier fortress, and not by its name.\n\nIt would be wrong to assume that Alexandria, the Mediterranean\nport, was the pivot of commerce, and that Fustat, originally the\ncapital of the country, derived its riches from its function as seat of\nthe administration. The unmistakable testimony of hundreds of\nGeniza letters proves that Fustat, the Arab inland city, was also the\ncommercial and financial center of the country, on which Alexan-\ndria, the originally Greek maritime town, was economically depen-\ndent in every respect. Fustat was the emporium of the region, where\nall the goods were hoarded. For consignments destined to be sent\noverseas, customs had to be paid first and foremost in Fustat, and no\ngoods could pass through its gate to the sea at Alexandria without\nbeing accompanied by the receipts for the dues issued in the capital.\nEven commodities from Mediterranean countries, which were im-\nported by way of Alexandria, had to be obtained from Fustat, when\nthey became scarce in the former city. Foreign currency from places\nwith which Alexandria entertained a lively commerce, was regularly\nacquired by Alexandrians in Fustat. Everyday commodities, such as\nshoes and clothing, implements for silversmithing or parchment\nand even ink, were ordered for Alexandria in the capital, “for here,”\nas several letters from Alexandria emphasize, “nothing is to be had.”\nTo be sure, Alexandria, like other places, had its local industries,\nsuch as its world-renowned mats, which were popular everywhere,\nits maqtac textiles, exported as far as India, and its pens, cut from the\nreeds of the lake of Maryit. It seems that it also served as the\ninternational entrepot and bourse of the silk trade.*\n\nThe situation was similar in Ifrigiya (present-day Tunisia) and\nPalestine. Goods were sent to Qayrawan via its port al-Mahdiyya, but\nas a rule, the consignments were not opened there; customs were\npaid in the capital. The great merchants lived in Qayrawan, their\nagents stayed in al-Mahdiyya. Wheat was cheapest in the capital,\nwhere it was stored. In times of scarcity one turned there.

In Palestine, commerce, the dispensation of justice,\nand communal life were concentrated in Ramle, the administrative\ninland capital. Its nearest ports, Jaffa and Caesarea, rarely occur in\nthe Geniza papers. The eastern shores of the Mediterranean, how-\never, had an ancient tradition of kingly maritime cities. Thus the\nGeniza clearly shows that Tyre, then—as in antiquity—the mighti-\nest town on that ccast, although serving Damascus as seaport, was\nnot dependent on the Syrian capital **\n\nAlexandria and Fustat differed also in the composition and char-\nacter of their populations. Both cities were full of foreigners. But the\ndifference seems to have been that those who had reached the\ncapital intended to remain there for good, whereas those staying\nbehind in Alexandria either had not yet made up their minds or\nwere resolved to return home bad qada al-hawd’j, after having\nattained their economic goals. It perhaps explains why we find fierce\nclashes between the foreigners and the local people in Alexandria,\nbut not in Fustat. Moreover, at least as far as the Jewish community is\nconcerned, the lower classes of Alexandria seem to have been\nstronger and more vociferous than those in the capital. They were\nan unruly crowd, always dissatisfied with their leadership and mak-\ning trouble which led to the interference of the Muslim authorities.\nThese, too, with few exceptions (and in contrast with those in Fustat)\nhad a bad name in the Geniza, and the mob of the port city was a\nceaseless nuisance and menace.\n\nThe presence of numerous visitors from Christian countries with\ntheir different social notions was not without influence. Drinking\nbouts accompanied 'by music, anathema to both Islam and tradi-\ntional Judaism, are reported from Alexandria. Riimi, that is, Italian\nor Greek, wine was preferred there to the local brand. In view of the\ndifferences in the life-styles of the two cities, Alexandrians might\nnot always have felt comfortable in the capital. When a woman in\nAlexandria learned that her brother, a widower living in Qalyib, a\nsmall town north of Cairo, was about to marry a girl from there (and\nnot, as she had feared, from Fustat) “she was happy that you did not\nbecome involved with people from Misr” (as reported in a letter to\nhim).** Conversely, a divorcée from Fustat, who became engaged to\na divorced man from Alexandria, stipulated that the couple would\nlive in the capital and that she was prepared to accompany him on his\nvisits to his family in Alexandria, but for not more than one month\nper year. A month, she obviously felt, was the maximum she could\nstand.?\n\nGoitein, S. D.

For towns situated on the trade routes of the Medi-\nterranean, see Med. Soc., 1,211-214. In Egypt, the number of large,\nmedium, and small towns, that have left their trace in the Geniza\ndocuments is considerable (see Index, s.v. Egypt, places in). Special\nattention is drawn to the meritorious paper by Norman Golb on the\nplaces of settlement of Jews in medieval Egypt, where repeated\nreferences are also made to Muslim and pre-Islamic sources.* Indi-\nvidual traits of the various localities and population shifts occurring\nin such places are recognizable, as may be concluded from the\nexamples of a middle-sized and two smaller local communities dis-\ncussed in Med. Soc., 11, 44—51.\n\nIt is remarkable that all places outside the capital and Alexandria,\nincluding such towns as Damietta, the Mediterranean port on the\neastern arm of the Nile, which was a main entrepot for trade with the\nSyro-Palestinian coast, and al-Mahalla al-Kubr3, a provincial capital\nand industrial center, were subsumed under the untranslatable\nterm rif, the Province. In the language of the Geniza letters dakhal,\ncoming home, meant returning to Fustat-Cairo or Alexandria from\na visit to towns of the Rif; khargj, leaving, meant the opposite. No\ndoubt, rif originally meant countryside, farmland, and rifi means\nthe peasant as opposed to the townsman.?” The extension of the\nterm to denote towns other than Cairo andAlexandria betrays a\nunique attachment to the great city.”®\n\nThis attitude had practical consequences. Marriage contracts\nstipulated that the husband was not permitted to exchange the city\nfor another place except with the consent of his wife. In one letter we\nread that a woman could not bear “life in the Rif” although she was\nmarried in the provincial capital al-Mahalla. She escaped to Cairo,\nbut her husband declared that at most he was able to manage to\nmake living in Damietta, where he offered to move with his recalci-\ntrant wife.*® A defaulting debtor would abscond from the city and\ntry to hide in one of the provincial communities, wherefore we find a\ncircular from a Nagid addressed to “all the judges and mugaddams\nin the Rif” to catch him.* Exigencies of business or office forced\nmany a Cairene or Alexandrian man to take up his domicile tempo-\nrarily in a smaller town, and bitter complaints about the “wrongs”\nsuffered there, about the “Sodom and Gomorrha” endured from its\nancouth people, may be read in the Geniza letters.®® Under these\ncircumstances it is not surprising that a member of the urban\njeunesse dorée appointed to posts in the Rif, again and again for-\nsook them and returned to the city.” Community officials implored\n\nGoitein, S.

The idea of being forced to pass a holiday\n“outside” was particularly abhorred.*\n\nAn incessant exodus from the Rif to the cities can be observed in\nthe Geniza documents. It is illustrated by the large number of\npersons bearing family names derived from small, even the smallest,\nvillages in the Egyptian countryside. The lists of the receivers of\nbread, clothing, and other help from the community of Fustat are\nfull of such names. But some of the influential families in the capital\nalso originated in the Rif. These migrations will occupy us again.?\n\nDespite this contrast, or even tension, between city and Rif, it is\nprecisely in the Geniza papers that we see the importance of the\nsmaller towns. There was a tendency to move not only from the Rif\nto the cities but also in the opposite direction. Persons bearing the\nfamily names of MistT, Iskandarani, Asqalini, Qudsi, or Dimashgi,\nthat is, originating from Fustat, Alexandria, Ascalon, Jerusalem, or\nDamascus, are encountered in the small towns of Egypt. In fact, we\nfind there people from all over the Mediterranean, including By-\nzantium and France. Edith Ennen, in her recent book on the Euro-\npean town in the Middle Ages, devotes a special section to the\nimportance of the small towns in medieval Europe.*\n\nIn more than one respect the small towns were of vital economic\nimportance for the people who left us their records in the Geniza.\nFlax and indigo, the staple exports of Egypt, were partly processed\nwhere they were grown and needed supervision at the source. The\nmanufacture of cheese, the main foodstuff after bread, was pre-\nferably done where the best sheep were bred, and its processing had\nto be supervised, since it was subject to ritual taboos. Jews, although\nto a lesser degree than Christians, were widely active as tax-farmers,\nand as such had to live in small towns or even villages in order to\ncollect the taxes in person. They were also employed by the govern-\nment in the Rif in other capacities.*® Jewish physicians and apothe-\ncaries seem to have been ubiquitous in the Rif.*” The economic\nstrength of the Rif is demonstrated by the fact that it was regularly\nvisited by traveling merchants and agents to sell their textiles,\nespecially silk, and other wares, and by persons soliciting funds for\nworks of public or private philanthropy.\n\nCairo and Fustat.—Still, the majority of the data on urban life\nrefers to the capital, and in what follows, where no remark to the\ncontrary is made, Fustat is meant.

The marriage contract of a wealthy\nbride from the year 1156 stipulates: “She will live in Fustat [called, of\ncourse, Misr in the document] to the exclusion of Cairo.” No reason\nis given for this condition, but it demonstrates how strongly the\ncontrast was felt almost two hundred years after the foundation of\nthe imperial city. Similarly, in 1248, a man “from Cairo” repudiates\nhis wife, who was “from Misrayim” (Heb., Fustat).’® The Maghrebi\nMuslim traveler Ibn Sa‘id, who visited Egypt in the 1240s, describes\nthe people of Fustat as soft-spoken and far friendlier than those of\nCairo and expresses his astonishment that there should be such a\ndifference between two adjacent cities.* The reason for the contrast\nprobably was the fact that Fustat was dominated by an easygoing\nmiddle class, whereas Cairo lived under the shadow of a stiff court.\nOriginally, Cairo “was the seat of the caliphate and no one lived\nthere except the caliph, his troops, his entourage, and those whom\nhe honored to be near to him.”® There is, indeed, documentary\nevidence that the Fatimid court physicians, higher government offi-\ncials, and other persons somehow connected with the court lived\nthere. When a Jewish government official was fired from his post he\nwas ordered to leave Cairo and to take up residence in Fustat.*!\nMasl’ah Gaon, the head of the Palestinian yeshiva, who moved to\nEgypt in 1127, bore the titles Jalal al-Mulk and T3j al-Riyisa (The\nLuster of the Empire and The Crown of the Leadership). His titles,\ntogether with the robes of honor bestowed on him according to an\nArabic Geniza letter, indicate that he, as head of the Jewish com-\nmunity, belonged to the caliph’s retinue. We find that he and some\nof the scholars attached to him did live in Cairo. Others had houses\nboth in Cairo and in Fustat.*\n\nParadoxically, Cairo, especially in Fatimid times, is represented in\nthe Geniza mostly not by the upper crust, for which it was renowned,\nbut by a social layer that both materially and spiritually was poorer\nthan many a community in a provincial town. The houses and\ndowries mentioned in the documents are often of low value, the\ndocuments themselves are not rarely of poor quality and signed by\npersons whose handwriting betrays them as having had little prac-\ntice in writing. This section of the population worked as menials,\nsuch as water carriers, or consisted of destitute persons who had\ncome to the city seeking help. The persons connected with the court\npresumably corresponded in Arabic characters, wherefore they had\nno reason to discard their letters in the Geniza chamber, or they left\ntheir Hebrew writings in their own synagogue, which has long since\ndisappeared.*\n\nGoitein, S.

For another three-quarters of a century\nthere is a steady flow of Geniza documents. Maimonides, though a\nphysician to the Ayyubid court, lived in Fustat and had to commute\nevery day to the Sultan’s palace in Cairo, a nuisance woefully de-\nscribed by him in one of his letters. His son, the Nagid Abraham\n(1186—1237), who, like his father, was a physician in attendance,\nalso lived in Fustat, which is proved by direct references to his home\nthere and by a little note inquiring whether he would spend a\nweekend in Cairo. By the middle of the thirteenth century, however,\nthe majority of the Jewish population of the capital must have been\nconcentrated in Cairo, and the correspondence of Abraham Mai-\nmonides’ great-grandson, the Nagid Joshua (1310—1355) shows the\nFustat community in full decay.*\n\nTopographic features.—The capital of Egypt is, of course, one of\nthe most studied cities of the Islamic world. Minute descriptions by\nmedieval Muslim scholars are invaluable, and their modern succes-\nsors, Egyptian and Western, have continued their work. The flood\nof literature on the occasion of Cairo’s millenary (969—1969) is\nindicative of this situation.* As far as Fustat, or Old Cairo, is con-\ncerned, excavations were carried out there at the beginning of this\ncentury and again during the last decade or so and still are going\non.* Ultimately it will be necessary to collect the rich topographic\nmaterial dispersed in the Geniza documents and to coordinate it\nwith the information to be gained from medieval sources and mod-\nern research. This task is outside the scope of this book. The short\ntopographic notes that follow aim at social rather than archaeolog-\nical aspects of the city’s history.\n\nThe nucleus of Fustat was formed by a Byzantine fortress, situ-\nated on the eastern bank of the Nile and called the Fortress of the\nGreeks or, more frequently, the Fortress of the Candles. The Chris-\ntian and Jewish elements remained preponderant in this, the pre-\nIslamic, section of the city, and time-honored churches, some of\nwhich are still extant, as well as the two main synagogues, were\nfound there. The place had entirely lost its military function. Some\nof the towers of the fortress were used as apartments and workshops\nand were owned in part by the synagogues as pious foundations.\nThe Islamic city, founded at the time of the conquest (a.p. 641},\nsurrounded the Fortress of the Greeks on the north, east, and south,\nand later, when the Nile silted up, also on the west.

It was called Ahl al-Raya,\nthose around the Standard, or al-Riya for short. Our documents\nreveal the interesting fact that six hundred years after the Muslim\nconquest, the main quarters were still called by the names of those\nancient Arab groups, such as Banana, Bani Wa'il, Khawlan, Mahra,\nTujib, Wa‘lan, but were inhabited, among others, by Jews. In Fati-\nmid times we also find Christians and Jews living in al-Raya, the\noriginal center of the Muslim city.**\n\nThe topographic terminology in the Geniza documents is rather\nfluid, which seems to indicate that in practice the borders between\nthe various parts of the city cannot have been too strict. George\nScanlon has come to a similar conclusion on archaeological evidence.\nThe term “khutt” was still used for the ancient tribal sectors of the\ncity, but could be applied also to an area of limited extent such as\nThe Old Spinnery.* The word designating a quarter today, hara,\ncould refer not only to a large district, such as the Mamsiisa, one of\nthe quarters of Fustat most frequently mentioned in the Geniza\ndocuments, or the even larger Mahra, a tribal sector, but also to a\nsmall place, described as a covered alley, to a prison, or to a little\nmosque. The two terms are found together in a document from\nal-Mabhalla, speaking of khuit harat al-Yahid, District of the Jewish\nQuarter (where Christians also lived).*® The word generally desig-\nnating a block, or segment of a street, suge (often spelled with s) could\nalso be applied to larger urban districts, such as the Fortress of the\nCandles, the Mamsusa, or the Great Bazaar.” Its derivative, tasqi §\ndesignated a public record that listed revenue from houses in a\ncertain district. In the Geniza it meant rent paid by the tenants living\nin houses that were communal property. The term was no doubt\nborrowed from the Fatimid administration where it designated a\ncadastre of houses for the purpose of taxation and police supervi-\nsion, as is known from Mamluk times.?? In Alexandria, but occa-\nsionally also elsewhere, a quarter was called nakiya, in modern times\nan administrative unit approximately the size of a county.® As far as\nwe can tell by our documents, it must have been more common in\nAlexandria to call a neighborhood by name without the addition of a\ndescriptive appellative.**\n\nSpecial mention must be made of the term rab®, which is as evasive\nin meaning as it is frequent.

But at the same\ntime it appears from this story that not all inhabitants lived in places\nprotected in this way. It tallies with a responsum by Maimon, father\nof Moses Maimonides, written in the third quarter of the twelfth\ncentury, which states that the markets of Fustat were not closed at\nnight. Yet that practice must have been fairly general in Fustat, at\nleast in earlier centuries, for in a description of the festival of\nEpiphany from the year 941, in which all parts of the population\ntook part, it is mentioned as something exceptional that during that\nparticular night the gates of the streets were not closed. One is\nreminded also of the order of the caliph al-Hakim to keep the\nmarkets open and brightly lit at night. To be sure, there is a differ-\nence between keeping a bazaar street or hall locked overnight and\ndoing the same with a residential alley or a compound.®\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "ix, A, 1 The City 15\n\nZoning.—Was there a marked division of the city into residential,\ncommercial, and industrial areas? A partial answer to this question is\ngiven in the subsections on craftsmen and business localities, Med.\nSoc., 1, 83—84, 193—195. The wide dispersion over the city of the\nubiquitous druggists or perfumers is described in Med. Soc., I,\n263 —264, where their Square, the Murabba“a, is characterized as a\nsocial center second in importance only to the synagogue. As is well\nknown from the works of medieval Muslim antiquarians and richly\nillustrated in the Geniza, many streets, bazaars, halls, and “houses”\nwere named for a certain branch of commerce, an industry, or a\nproduct. It is true not only for Fustat but also for other cities, for\nexample, Damascus. In addition, the Geniza reveals that this con-\ncentration of the various branches of economy in separate districts\nwas by no means complete. Mills and presses (of oil and wine) seem\nto have been common in residential areas.®\n\nSimilarly, there must have been some districts that were exclu-\nsively or predominantly residential, and others that were essentially\nreserved for economic activities. In many cases the neighboring\nhouses forming the object of deeds of transfer are described as the\nhouses of private persons. When there is a shop in a house it is\nexpressly stated. We find high-priced houses, clearly serving as\nliving quarters, bordering on busy bazaars; stores are often topped\nby an ‘ulizw, that is, one or several stories used as domiciles.** We find\na physician in the street of the wax makers, another in that of the\nhorseshoers, and a judge in the bazaar of the perfumers.® A sugar\nworkshop belonging to a physician is expressly described also as\nknown as his domicile (sukn, which could hardly mean his office).®®\nConversely, a petition addressed to the vizier Ibn al-Sallar al-Malik\nal- Adil (Dec. 1150) with regard to the estate of a t@jir, or prominent\nmerchant, emphatically makes a distinction between the family’s\nmatbakh, (sugar) factory, and sukn, living quarters.®” An interesting\nbut fragmentary letter says: “People who had been living in their\nproperties give them up. When you sell the house, they will convert\nit into a workshop (ma‘mal).”*\n\nEugen Wirth, in his previously mentioned basic study on the\nbazaar, comes to the conclusion that the characteristic arrangement\nof the traditional Middle Eastern city was the strict separation of\nresidential quarters from those destined for economic activities,\nwith the latter situated in the middle of town, the combination\nforming an organic whole.

The twin stores were\nbordered by two other stores, one belonging to a church, the church\nitself, and a street. The twin houses were bordered by two private\nhomes, a lane, and by “the mills in the Market of the Greeks.”™\nSlightly earlier, a father gave to a married daughter a house sur-\nrounded by the homes of two Christian neighbors, the property of a\nMuslim woman, and a non-Jewish house of worship (not the one\nmentioned in the preceding deed).” In a mortgage deed of spring\n969 (the year of the Fatimid takeover) the property concerned was\nsituated opposite the B Sarga (St. Sergius) Church, one neighbor-\ning house belonged to a Jew, another was described as “known as the\nhouse of Mr. Goldsmith,” and the description of the third is lost.” I n\nJuly 1004 a man sold to a representative of merchants, a man from\nnorthern Palestine, one-third of a house, which third he had inher-\nited from his father. It bordered on property of an ophthalmologist,\nkahhal, of two Jews, one of whom bore a Persian name, and a\nChristian called Ben Masih, son of Jesus.

The neighborhood was known as The Wool\nHall, gaysariyyat al-sif,”* and the house was surrounded by proper-\nties named after a wax maker, a seller (and probably also preparer)\nof raisins, a belt maker, a (Christian) manufacturer of glass, and a\nwoman defined solely by the name, not the occupation, of her\nhusband. The house had three small inner courts. This archi-\ntectural feature, however, should not induce us (as it has excavators)\nto assume that the house served exclusively as living quarters. As\ndiscussed later, the ga‘a, or ground floor with an inner court, was\nlargely used for industrial and commercial undertakings.” The\nbuyer of the shares was a money changer.

The fact that the Christians,\nformer rulers of the country, were wealthier than the Jews explains\nwhy they were the first to move out to the new, Muslim town; they\nwere replaced by Jews, wherefore we find, in three of the examples\nabove, Jews possessing properties in the immediate vicinity of\nChristian houses of worship.\n\nLow-priced houses with both domiciles and stores were common\noutside the Greek fortress too, even in the Great Market bordering\nit. In Jan./Feb. 1139 a woman there sold to another one-quarter of a\nhouse for 14 1/2 dinars (total value of house, 58). The neighboring\nproperties were remarkably diversified: a small house; a store in\nruins; a newly build fundug, or caravanserai; and a tower of the\nRoman fortress, which belonged to “the Jewish synagogue.” Besides\nthe two doors of its stores (possibly workshops) “its door,” that is, the\none leading to the living quarters, is specifically mentioned.* A few\nyears earlier a widow sells in the same neighborhood, the Mamsusa,\nwhich is described as containing or partly overlapping the Great\nMarket, one-sixth of a house with an upper floor, and two stores,\neach of which faced a different street, for 11 dinars (total value,\n66).°' There are other examples.®\n\nThe same district, however, harbored high-priced homes that\ncontained no stores and were surrounded by other homes or open\nspace. The Great Market and the Mamsusa formed parts of the\nTujib district, which was bordered on the east by the Fortress of the\nGreeks. Tujib was one of the more prominent Arab clans to settle in\nFustat immediately after the conquest. They belonged to the royal\ntribe of Kinda. Their leader Mu‘awiya b.

The Tujib were also notorious for\nstarting the first civil war in Islam, which led to the assassination of\nthe third caliph, Othman. (“When the caliph ascended the pulpit to\naddress the people assembled in the mosque, a man from the Tujib\nof Fustat, clad in a yellow silk robe, stood up, cursed the caliph, and\nchided him for his bad government.”) The Tujib vigorously took\npartin the conquest of North Africa, bringing immense booty home\nto Fustat, and later they were prominent in Spain. We may imagine,\nthrefore, that the Tujib district of Fustat originally was purely Arab\nand probably also very luxurious. Because of the proximity of the\nFortress of the Greeks, however, it was infiltrated by Christians and\nJews, so that by the fifth Islamic century it presented a completely\nmixed picture, both with regard to the composition of its population\nand the juxtaposition of residential and predominantly commercial\nneighborhoods.**\n\nHouses with twin stores and upper apartments, their boundaries,\nand prices have already been discussed. [n the Tujib quarter are\nnumerous examples of high-priced and prestigious residences,\nmany forming compounds of several buildings. In 1139 a Jew sells to\nanother one-half of a house in the Mamsusa (spelled here Musasa)\nwhich they had built in partnership, for 300 dinars, making the total\nhouse worth 600 dinars, one of the highest prices for a house\nmentioned in the Geniza. Unfortunately, the document does not\nspell out the boundaries, because the building was “famous.”** On\nAugust 25, 1151, a physician gives to his son a large house newly\nerected by him in the same quarter, as we learn from an Arabic\ndocument written by a Muslim notary. It bordered on the house of a\nmason, a ruin belonging to a Muslim pious foundation, a zareba, or\ncattle pen, belonging to a qadi, and on the House of Ibn al-‘Ajami,\nSon of the Persian, who could have been a Muslim, Christian, or\nJew.®® In 1156 Sulayman, son of the late Aba Zikri Kohen, a repre-\nsentative of merchants in Fustat and a prominent India trader,\nbought for one of his two stepsisters one-eighth of a house in the\nsame district, namely, in the Street of the Wine Dealers, nabbadhin,\nin the neighborhood of the suwaygat al-wazir, Little Market of the\nVizier, well known from Arabic sources. The price of that share was\n50 dinars (total value, 400 dinars). But the Muslim historians seem-\ningly were reluctant to perpetuate the name of a street of wine\ndealers, although a traveler from the conservative Maghreb noted\nwith dissatisfaction that—despite the censure of the Koran—wine\nwas sold openly in the capital of Egypt.*®\n\nLater in the century a compound of four houses, two ruins, and a\n\nGoitein, S.

There were residential neighborhoods with houses of\nhigh value, but they did not form large, independent quarters; they\nwere more like islands surrounded by a network of bazaars and\nstreets with houses consisting of twin stores topped by domestic\nstructures and generally of low price. Even an area of suburban\ncharacter, such as the Jazira, or Island of the Nile (known today as\nRéda, Garden), is represented in the Geniza by store-top homes:\none house was worth approximately 660 dinars; another house,\nbounded by the palace of the late vizier Ibn Killis and other presti-\ngious homes (one situated in an orchard), comprised also a building\nof two shops bordering on an open space.

From\na Muslim document it appears that a Jew acquired a considerable\ntract of land in that neighborhood as early as 922.%\n\nThe general picture emerging from the data seems to indicate\nthat in the times and places concerned the division of a city into\nresidential and commercial areas was not regulated by statute. In\npractice some sort of zoning was achieved by private initiative, by the\nprotection that Islamic (and Jewish) law granted a propriétor against\nany changes effected by a neighbor which might prove harmful to\nhis own property.\n\nA characteristic example, taken from a legal inquiry submitted to\nthe Nagid Abraham Maimonides (d. 1237), vividly illustrates the\nproblem. A dyer converted a house in a residential neighborhood,\ndiyar al-sukna, into a workshop, the smoke of which caused grave\nnuisance to his neighbor. The latter sold his house; the new propri-\netor let it fall into disrepair and sold it as a ruin. The third landlord\nrenovated the place and complained about the smoke which made it\nimpossible for him “to hang his linen or wool clothing.” The dyer\nmoved his furnace from the wall he shared with his neighbor to the\none facing the lane, but the smoke still proved to be damaging.\nAlthough the dyer had converted his house into a workshop fifteen\nyears before the neighboring house was acquired by its new pro-\nprictor, Abraham Maimonides decided in favor of the latter, for\n“damage has no claim based on undisturbed possession.” If it could\nbe proved that one of the former proprietors had waived his rights,\nthe complaint would be dismissed.

In this respect, too, the situation in the High Middle\nAges was far more fluid than in later times. The detailed discussion\nof this problem in Med. Soc., 11, 289—293, shows that Jewish houses\nbordered on those belonging to and occupied by Christians or\nMuslims, or both, that Christians and Muslims lived in Jewish houses\nand vice versa, and that properties were held in partnership by\nmembers of the three religions. Jews as a rule lived in a limited\nnumber of neighborhoods, but none was exclusively Jewish. There\nis no reason to assume that the situation was different with regard to\nother sections of the population. On the contrary. By the very\ninjunctions of their religion Jews were forced to concentrate in\ncertain neighborhoods. Since they were not permitted to ride on\nSabbaths and religious holidays, they had to live within walking\ndistance from their synagogues. Moreover, Judaism stresses, more\nempbhatically than Islam, the importance of daily attendance at\ncommunal worship.\n\nFinally, Jewish (and certainly also Christian) women disliked\nsharing houses with Muslims because with such neighbors the\nIslamic purdah affected them too. To avoid the inconvenience for\ntheir womenfolk, Jewish authorities promulgated statutes from time\nto time prohibiting the sale or lease of parts of houses to Muslims.\nTwo letters addressed to Moses Maimonides emphasized that\nrestrictions like these considerably reduced the value of Jewish\nproperties. A recently discovered letter to the Nagid Abraham,\nMaimonides’ son, illustrates an opposite situation: apartment\nhouses inhabited exclusively by Jews were difficult to come by and\ntherefore were expensive. The rent in such a house was beyond the\nfinancial capacity of an unhappy husband whose wife had the right\nto choose the couple’s domicile; she insisted on renting a floor in a\nhouse without undesirable neighbors. Meanwhile, she had left the\nfamily home of the husband, to which, as usual, she had been\nbrought first, and was staying with her brother. The writer asks\nwhether the young wife could now be forced by court decision to be\ncontent with an apartment in a house inhabited at least partly by\nJews.

The\nabundance of references to ruins in the writings of the Muslim\nhistorians of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries might induce\nthe belief that they reflect the general decline marking the Late\nMiddle Ages. But ruins appear in the Geniza documents of the\neleventh and twelfth centuries as frequently as in the pages of an Ibn\nDuqmaiq or al-Maqrizi. High-priced neighborhoods no less than\npoor environments were dotted with them. The data also concern\ncities besides Fustat, such as Damascus and Jerusalem. It is note-\nworthy that the Maghrebi traveler Ibn Sa‘id, in the passage referred\nto above, note 36, observed that there were many ruins in Fustat, but\nstates at the same time that a revival had taken place owing to the\ninflux of the military.\n\nRuins were repeatedly mentioned as adjoining, facing, or being\nin the vicinity of inhabited buildings, either as being bequeathed or\nsold together with them, or, to the contrary, expressly excluded\nfrom a transaction. In July 1156, a government official bequeathed\nto his younger sister, the widow of “a merchant in the House of\nExchange,” one-half of the house in which he lived together with\none-half of a ruin adjoining it. The property was situated in the\nFortress of the Greeks between the two synagogues and opposite the\nwomen’s bathhouse known as the Bath of the Cook. The two syna-\ngogues were connected by the often mentioned Milk Alley, zugag\nal-laban, probably named thus because milk, which was subject to a\nreligious taboo, was sold there to members of the community. In any\ncase, it was a much frequented place. One-half of a house in the\nprestigious Hudayji Street was sold in 1143/4 by its proprietor and\noccupant for 75 dinars. He had to declare in court that the ruin\nadjoining it was not his and consequently was not included in the\nsale.

The house is in bad shape and unoccupied, and I am afraid,\nit might be taken by the government [raz!, which could also mean billeting],\nfor the finance director [s@hib al-diwan] lives on our side in the house of\nJoseph; he has become an old man [skaykh, might also mean important\nperson], who takes walks across the roofs [and knows well what goes on in the\nhouses]. The Ghuzz might take it and I cannot say a word. Imagine! Ibn\nal-Sartji [family name derived from Sariij, a town in northwestern Mesopo-\ntamia, today Siirii¢] has sold his house because of the Ghuzz. I implore you\nby God, quench my yearning and come.

These payments to the government for unoc-\ncupied premises were clearly quite regular features and needed no\nspecial comment.”® The enigmatic “Vacancy—1/2” in an account\nfor 1183 probably was hush money for a Muslim gatekeeper.'®\n\nThese references in the Geniza to empty apartments or houses\nand others like them are not necessarily symptoms of a decline in\npopulation. A decline is palpably felt when we notice a sudden\nincrease in the number of uninhabited premises, so many that the\ncharitable foundations found it expedient to draw up lists of them\nand of premises still occupied. It happened in 1201, when the\ndevastating famine and great plague played havoc among the popu-\nlation, a blow from which Fustat never recovered.'\"’\n\nThe obligatory report to the government of unoccupied premises\nwas not solely a matter of finance, namely, that they were deserted\nand therefore fiscal property. It was a security measure. When the\nvizier al-Ma’'miin in 1124 ordered the heads of the police of the twin\ncapital to register the names of all the inhabitants and not to permit\nthem to move from one house to another without his authorization,\nhe was not interested in statistics (religious Muslims and Jews shun\nfixed numbers), but did so because he dreaded the infiltration of\nterrorists from the secessionist sect of the Assassins.!'® Vacant prem-\nises were a threat to public security.

The proprietors of a wakala\nwere of widely differing provenance. One could be an illustrious\nqadi, or a man from the Egyptian Rif, or the son of a Jewish\nimmigrant from Spain. In Fatimid and early Ayyubid times these\nwakalas, like family firms, were of short duration—two, at most\nthree generations—and did not leave a mark on the look of the city.\nThe time of the great khans, as the wakilas were later called, began\nin the thirteenth century.'*\n\nThe various “houses” named after a commodity, such as jewelry,\nsilk, carpets, threads, sugar, rice, oil, vinegar, saffron, almonds, or\napples—all occurring both in the Geniza and in the works of the\nMuslim historians—served similar purposes, but some functioned\nalso as toll stations. The term “house” in this connection is perhaps\nbest translated as “bazaar.”**\n\nOne example should serve as an illustration. The dar al-jawhar,\nthe Jewelry House, was situated in the vicinity of the Mosque of\n‘Amr, the oldest “cathedral” mosque in the capital (still extant).

But the reading baraka, blessings, is\nestablished by al-dar al-mubdraka, The Blessed House, in Alex-\nandria,'® and, to the best of my knowledge, no pool was found in the\nStreet of the Coppersmiths of Fustat. “God’s blessing makes rich”\n(Proverbs 10:22), and fixed sums of coins, as traded in that house,\nwere exposed to the evil eye and in need of particular protection\nfrom Heaven. The dar al-baraka appears in the Geniza frequently\nas an address, for example (in Arabic characters), “To the office of\nJoseph, the Kohen, House of Blessings, Coppersmiths” or as a place\nwhere one obtained sealed purses with fixed sums, which could be\ntraded without being examined by an assayer.'*®\n\nThe dar al-sarf, literally, the house of Money Changing, must\nhave been so well known that it served as an address without any\nadditional topographical identification.

Soc., 1, 238—239, seem to indicate that the\nplace had a semiofficial status. It was not merely a hall where certi-\nfied money changers had their seat. It might well have been that the\nFatimid government received and made payments through “the big\nmerchants aof the House of Exchange.” One Geniza letter is\naddressed to the Square of Money Changing, murabba‘at al-sarf, but\nit is doubtful that the Square and the House were identical.'*\nMuslim topographers, who wrote long after the Fatimid period,\nmention neither.

In the Middle Ages these\nelements were still disjointed, functionally and geographically. It\nwas the great monarchies of Ottoman Turkey, Iran, and, Morocco,\nand the flourishing times of the sixteenth and carly seventeenth\ncenturies which completed what an earlier period had prepared.'*\n\nThe House of God as the gathering place for the people.— The observa-\ntion has been made that the medieval Islamic city lacked a central\npublic square, comparable with the Greek agora or the Roman\nforum, because it did not possess the democratic institutions that\nrequired a large open space for communal assemblies. This reason-\ning misses the point. The Muslims were “brothers through their\nreligion” (Koran 9:11, 33:5); the constituent element of their polity\nwas their faith. Consequently the natural place for their public\ngatherings was the mosque. The same held true, and perhaps with\neven stronger force, for the houses of worship of Christians and\nJews within Islam.\n\nThe Friday mosque, that is, the cathedral mosque of a city, or the\nmain mosque of a quarter in a large city, proclaimed this purpose in\nits very architecture. It was of large dimensions in itself, and, in\naddition, possessed a spacious court, so that the entire male popula-\ntion of a city or a representative part of it could assemble there at one\ntime.\n\nThe people attending communal prayer were by no means a\npassive crowd following the recitation of the leader of the service, or\nsilently listening to the person occupying the pulpit, whether he was\na caliph, a governor, or a professional preacher. As the example on\np- 00 illustrates, the mosque was the place where the assembled\ncould give vent to their grievances, and, of course, where the rulers\nor popular leaders tried to create public opinion. Because of the\npaucity of other means of communications, the mosque was also the\nplace for public announcements.\n\nMoreover, with its shady colonnades and other structures adjoin-\ning it, the mosque formed an extended compound, sufficient to\nharbor all the public, religious, and cultural activities with which the\ncommunity was concerned.

As we\nhave seen, mosques, like churches and synagogues, were often situ-\nated in the midst of lively commercial neighborhoods; it is natural:\nwhere there are people, there is business. It should be noted that the\nuse of church premises for secular purposes was by no means un-\nknown in medieval Western Europe. Edith Ennen emphasizes that\nwell into the thirteenth century the urban public bodies of many\nItalian cities held their meetings in the churches (or the palaces of\nthe bishops).'**\n\nFinally, in Islam, as in Judaism, study is a prime religious duty.\nBefore the eleventh century, when special buildings, richly endowed\nby foundations, began to be dedicated to higher education, the\nmosque was the natural place for study and instruction. Masters and\nstudents of all “Islamic” subjects (to which also belonged knowledge\nof the Arabic language) could be found there, forming circles of\ndifferent size and duration. Learning was fostered by libraries\nhoused in the premises of the mosques, some of which have become\nrenowned for their treasures. And despite the development of\nbuildings and institutions of Muslim higher education, the mosque,\nlike the synagogue, never ceased to serve as a house of study,\nespecially on a more popular level (which nowadays would be\nlabeled as adult education). I recall vividly a visit to a mosque in\nBursa, Turkey, some time before the sunset prayer, when I ob-\nserved ordinary people from the neighborhood listening to an\nexposition of a sacred text, occasionally addressing the reader witha\nremark or a question. A few days before I had been present in a\nsmall synagogue in Jerusalem between the afternoon and evening\nprayer, where Yemenites, mostly craftsmen, recited the Mishna (the\nbasic source of Jewish Oral Law) in unison, thus concluding, or\ninterrupting, their day’s work. In both cases, I was struck by the\nimpression that for these people the House of God was theirs; it was\nthe meeting place of the community.'*\n\nNaturally, the Geniza is not a source for the role of the mosque in\nIslam.?®\" But it was necessary to include here these few remarks in\norder to put the mosque’s place in Islamic urbanism into proper\nfocus.

(I paid hirasa in Jerusalem until 1938.) The protection was\nboth stationary and mobile, and there might have been changes in\nthis respect during the Geniza period. Permanent protection was\nrepresented by the hami ’l-hara or the darrab, the guards for a\nquarter or a block, and, especially, the sahib al-rub‘, the gatekeeper\nof a compound, three terms that were probably interchangeable.*™\nThe night watchmen, tawwafiin, those who make the round, as their\ntitle indicates, were ambulant. There is definite information that\n\n~Jews, too, could be employed as night watchmen, which was a job like\n\nany other. Consequently it would appear that this service was orga-\nnized by the neighborhood concerned. The difference is reflected\nin the bookkeeping of the community. The hirasa was a monthly\npayment incumbent on a building; therefore it is listed regularly in\nthe accounts of the real estate owned by the pious foundations. The\nemoluments of the night watchmen were a matter of agreement\nbetween them and the community; they appear in the lists of benefi-\nciaries receiving cash and loaves of bread and are recorded from the\nmiddle of the eleventh through the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury.

Finally, the period of Fatimid and early Ayyubid\nrule, during which most of the Geniza papers were written, was\ndistinct from the later Middle Ages, which furnished most of the\nmaterial to the authors who have so admirably described the atti-\ntudes of the medieval Mediterranean man to his city.

In Geniza times, a man’s house was “the inheritance of his\nfathers” (1 Kings 21:3), the town where his father and mother were\nlaid to rest. A merchant from Jerusalem angrily left his native city\nafter having suffered serious losses there and settled in Egypt. His\nfriends admonished him to return—not because Jerusalem was the\nholy city, but because it contained the tombs of his father and\nmother.*®* A Jerusalem pilgrim from the Maghreb had been im-\npeded from reaching the goal of his journey first by the struggle\nbetween the Fatimids and the Seljuks and the general insecurity of\nthe roads, second, by the civil war over the caliphal succession, which\nled to the siege of Alexandria where he happened to stay, and,\nfinally, by the advent of the Crusaders. Notwithstanding these ad-\nversities, which were aggravated by a prolonged illness, he assures\nhis relatives that he would tarry until the Egyptian army would have\nexpelled the Crusaders. But, he adds, after having “seen” Jerusa-\nlem, he was resolved to return to his hometown, watan, and “the\ninheritance of his fathers.”?\n\nUsing the same phrase, an ascetic who had settled in Jerusalem in\norder to “mourn” its desolation and “to tear himself away from the\nworld,” speaks of his intention to return (where to, is not pre-\nserved).’*® The term watan has been translated here as homefown\n(and not homeland which it could mean, too), for the intention of\nthe writer was to return to the place where his family lived.

Countries were political complexes,\noften changing their borders and characters, cities were units of life.\n\nSuch blessings usually appear in addresses, but ofien also in the\ntext of a letter, for example, “I happened to be in Labla [Spain], may\nGod protect her”;?* or even in a legal document: thus a contract of\npartnership is concluded “in the city of Fez [Morocco], may God\nkeep her.””' In this connection, the Geniza writers sometimes use\nHebrew phrases, even in an Arabic context, as when a man from\nJerba, Tunisia, writes “to Cairo, may God shield her King and\nherself, Amen.””\"' The most remarkable Hebrew example of at-\ntachment to one’s city is found in the biblical phrase “May the Most\nHigh establish her forever,” used exclusively with regard to the\nHoly City of Jerusalem, but applied in a letter to the name of the\nEgyptian capital, where the writer resided.*'*\n\nIn later centuries it became customary in Jewish letters to attach\nthe blessing to the Holy Congregation in a certain city, not to the\nname of the city itself. This change reflects, of course, the deteriora-\ntion of relations among the various religious communities. This\nalienation became extreme where oppression proved to be unbear-\nable. I remember how shocked I was when 1 first read in a letter\n(many others in the same vein were to follow): “From X [a town in\nYemen], may it be destroyed and laid waste, to Jerusalem, may it be\nbuilt and established forever.” I was shocked because it was the\n1920s, but not surprised. It was the way in which one spoke of the\ncity of an enemy in an Islamic ambiance. The highly cultivated\nMuslim traveler Ibn Jubayr writes, “Acre, may God destroy it,”\nbecause, at the time of the writing (1183), that Palestinian city\n(Akko) was in the hands of the Crusaders.*\"* Nothing of the kind is\nfound in the papers of Ibn Jubayr’s contemporaries, the Geniza\npeople. They heeded the admonition of the Prophet Jeremiah\naddressed to the Judean captives in Babylonia: “Pray for the welfare\nof the city to which I [God is speaking] have exiled you . . . for her\nwelfare is yours.”'\n\nIn most Geniza letters the blessing refers to the city of the recip-\n\nGoitein, S.

Itis, so to say,\nthe idea of the city, namely, the benefits any city bestows on its\ninhabitants, which makes it worthy of God’s protection. The term\n“watan” originally designated a place where a man’s family was\nindigenous and he himself was born. But in the mobile Islamic\nsociety watan came to mean also one’s adopted city. Thus, Nahray\nand his cousin were Tunisians who had settled in Egypt, one in\nAlexandpria, the other in Fustat. But in the letter cited, the cousin\nspeaks of their watans.*® It tallies with Arabic literary usage. The\nrenowned Maghrebi historian Ibn Sa‘id, quoting a source contem-\nporary to Nahray, says of the Fatimids that they “took Cairo as their\nwatan,” meaning, their seat and new home (as opposed to their\noriginal home, the Muslim West, from which Ibn Sa‘id himself\nhailed).*¢\n\nThis expansion of the linguistic usage betrays a change in social\nattitudes. The ancient Arabs despised the populace they conquered,\nwho could identify themselves only by their place of habitation, and\nnot, like their overlords, by a noble lineage. But that paragon of\nArab virtues, al-Ahnaf, the leader of the Tamim tribe in the newly\nfounded city of Basra, was reported to have said: “An Azdi [a\nmember of the rival tribe] of Basra is dearer to me than a Tamimi of\nKiifa.” The urban community had become (or was on the way to\nbecoming) a reality of greater concern than the bonds of lineage.?'”\n\n“Throughout the Middle Ages cities grew solely through influx\nfrom their environment.” This statement, made by Edith Ennen\nwith regard to Europe, certainly could be applied to a large extent to\nthe capital of Egypt.*'* Many of the illustrious men of Islamic letters\nornating Cairo-Fustat derived their family names from smaller\ntowns in Egypt such as al-Subki, al-Qalqashandi, and al-Sha‘rani,\nand were actually born there, but it is not surprising that ordinary\nJewish persons with the same family names left their records in the\nGeniza.”*® The number of Jewish inhabitants of Fustat named after\nobscure localities in the Egyptian Rif is surprising; some of them\nwere paupers, but others were not.*** Smaller towns, such as Damira\nor Damsis, provided men who rose to riches and to influential\npositions in the Fustat community.?”® The Mediterranean port\nDamietta gave its name to at least ten families or persons in Fustat\ndiffering from one another by origin (Kohens, or “simple” Jews),\nsocioeconomic position (schoolmasters, physicians, India traders,\ndivines) and, of course, the periods in which they were active. Often\nit is difficult to decide whether a person was a newcomer to the\ncapital or the son of one.

In his early years in Egypt Nah-\nray b. Nissim of Qayrawan was identified as al-Maghribi, but in the\nvast majority of cases this epithet was omitted, because Nahray had\nbecome a permanent resident of Fustat. The same happened with\nthe often mentioned ‘Arisb. Joseph, in some letters called al-\nMahdawi (from the Tunisian port al-Mahdiyya), but mostly appears\nwithout that epithet. Much research will be necessary before it can be\nestablished with even approximate likelihood whether the majority\nof the Jewish inhabitants of the Egyptian capital represented in\nGeniza papers were indigenous, or had adopted it as their home. My\nimpression is that the percentage of newcomers or their children\nwas exceedingly high. One wonders how such circumstances might\nhave affected a man’s attitude to his town.\n\nIn ancient Israel, where the citizens were mostly “Ackerbiirger.”\nfarmers organized in small urban settlements surrounded by walls,\nthe town was one’s “mother” (2 Samuel 20:19), the relationship was\nnatural and, as a rule, indissoluble. In the mobile and mercantile\nworld of the Geniza times, the connection of a man with his town\nshould be rather compared with the bond of marriage. Marriage\nmay be dissolved by divorce, and Muslims, Jews, and even the\nChristians of Egypt often took recourse to this expediency.?*® Simi-\nlarly, many Geniza letters speak of the writer’s intention to forsake\nhis hometown or report about such a step.** But once a marriage is\nsuccessful, it might become a stronger bond than that created by\nfilial piety. The strong attachment of the Geniza man to his watan,\nwhether in the sense of native city or a place chosen for permanent\nresidence, has been illustrated above in various ways. In a written\nsource like the Geniza these feelings are most vigorously expressed\nwhen the writer is away from home and is longing to return:\n\n“Yearning after one’s home,” al-hanin ila \"l-watan, was a great\ntopic in ancient Arabic poetry. Al-Jahiz, the renowned creator of the\nArabic essay (d. 869), dedicated a special study to this genre.”*\nGustave von Grunebaum evaluated it for the modern reader.?** The\nverses written by the unhappy Jewish doctor from Alexandria who\npracticed his art in Qus, Upper Egypt (cited in Med. Soc., I1, 259)\nmay give an idea of that type of poetry.?*”\n\nIt is noteworthy, however, that medieval Muslim writers recog-\nnize a man’s attachment to his hometown as an important socio-\nlogical factor.

His answer is one word: watan, love of one’s native\ncity. The Geniza letters show that, in the eleventh century at least,\nthere was another good reason for Zughar’s existence: it was an\nentrepot of the trade between North Arabia and the Mediterra-\nnean.””® Ibn Jubayr reports that Muslims returned to Tyre, Leba-\nnon, although that city was in Christian hands at the time and\ntherefore due to be destroyed. He explains their blameworthy\naction by man’s natural attachment to his hometown.*®\n\nThe same motive is found even in official documents. A dhimmi,\nor non-Muslim from Alexandria, had been forced by the adversities\nof the time to leave his cherished city, his parents and brothers, and\nto settle in a place where he had commercial dealings with a govern-\nment office (which one is not said). Now, he writes, “he has been\nrepeatedly visited by remembrance of his hometown and longing\nafter it,” wherefore he respectfully asks that his affairs be settled so\nthat he might return to Alexandria.*®® Similarly, a Muslim baker\npetitions the caliph’s vizier to permit him to pay a debt in install-\nments so that he may be able “to remain in his native city, his\nwatan.”?!\n\nThe attachment to one’s city is most patently manifested in the\nconcern for one’s compatriots. Baladiyya in modern Arabic means\nmunicipality, but in the Geniza letters it designates the feelings and\ncare for the inhabitants of one’s town. In a highly interesting docu-\nment from 1122 an aged man from Tripoli turns over his posses-\nsions to a relative from the same city living in Fustat who, in return,\nwould take care of him until his death. He trusted the man because\nof “the common bonds of family and city.”** A Jewish dignitary\nfrom the Maghreb, in asking the Egyptian Jewish authorities to\ninquire about the death of a Maghrebi merchant, who was mur-\ndered on his way to Yemen, adds: “He is also my co-citizen, baladina,\nand I am particularly concerned about him.”*** Such feelings were\nby no means confined to the members of one’s own religion.**\n\nWhile away from home, baladis stuck together: Maghrebis\n(meaning mostly persons from Qayrawin and its port city al-\nMahdiyya) in Alexandria and Fustat or wherever we find them;\nnewcomers from Hebron and Ghaza in Ascalon; people from\nTiberias in Acre; people from Aleppo in al-Mahalla; and groups of\npilgrims from Tyre and Tiberias fighting one another in Ramle.\nBeyond these examples, where compatriots are expressly men-\ntioned as groups, a major part of the Geniza correspondence reflects\nthe same situation, inasmuch as overseas trade was largely organized\n\nGoitein, S.

This might have been true with regard to later times. In\nthe Geniza I cannot find that attitude. A study of the topographic\nfeatures of Fustat proves that the many quarters and districts men-\ntioned in the Geniza were not clearly separated from one another;\nthere was much overlapping and seemingly no strict division.?* The\nvarious religions and denominations or sects formed distinct\ngroups, but social separation among them was far less rigid than in\nthe later Middle Ages. Similar observations have been made with\nregard to Europe.”®” The division of a city into separate adminis-\ntrative units indicates the ever stronger bureaucratic rule of military\nelites, as was apparent in the Mamluk state and perfected under the\nOttomans. It seems, also, that the population of the capital of Egypt\nunder the Fatimids was considerably smaller than under the Ayyu-\nbids and early Mamluks, when the twin cities were united into one\nlarge complex with much new space encircled by a wall and de-\nfended by a fortress. In short, Fustat was then still a manageable\nentity, a place where one could feel that one belonged.\n\nThe question of ghettoes for the members of minority groups is\ndiscussed in Med. Soc., 11, 289, where it is shown in detail that in\nclassical Geniza times Muslims, Christians, and Jews lived in close\nproximity. There were predominantly Jewish neighborhoods,\nespecially in the vicinity of synagogues, an arrangement made\nalmost necessary by the practice of daily attendance at the public\nservice. Occasionally a contract stipulates or mentions that the\nproperty transferred might be alienated solely to a Jew. A newly\nidentified Geniza document, in which one party renounces its right\nof preemption to another, formulates this condition thus: “They\nmay sell the nine and a half shares of the house acquired to any Jew\nthey wish.” The house was situated in the Bir Jabr quarter of\nAlexandria, which harbored the synagogue of the Iragians of that\ncity, but was contiguous with the house of a gissis, or Christian\nclergyman.®$\n\nIn discussing the question of marital habitation, the Talmud\nstates that a husband could not force his wife to follow him from a\nmiddle-sized town to a big city, “because life in big cities is hard.”\nAccording to the medieval commentators the reason for this state-\nment was the congestion and unhealthiness of cities, whereas\n\nGoitein, S.

These bits of information enable us to form an\nidea of the type of home regarded as desirable in those days. In\nmodern times people tried to make their premises convenient and\npleasing by an appropriate choice of furnishings and furniture. The\narchitect seen at work in the Geniza papers seems to have striven\nmainly for the creation of inner space, of roominess. He tried to\nbring the expanse of the sky into the interior of the house. It was\nachieved first and foremost by the general layout of a dwelling.\nWhether on the ground floor or in the upper stories, there was one\nvery large social room, the majlis, tentatively translated by me as\nliving room; the numerous other rooms were small and very small;\nthey are often noted as “belonging” to the majlis. Structural items,\nsuch as wall cabinets, and ornate recesses and niches fulfilled the\npurposes of armoires and even bedsteads. Fasily movable objects\nserved instead of fixed pieces of heavy furniture. And the inner\ncourt, often beautified by a fountain, sometimes even by a garden,\nbrought God’s wide world—sky, water, and plants—into the space\ncreated by man.\n\nMobility within the house conditioned the rhythm of life. Despite\nthe rich architectural nomenclature of the Geniza and contempo-\nrary Muslim documents we would look there in vain for such terms\nas dining room or bedroom. In winter one slept in a small closet,\nwhich could easily be warmed by a brazier; in summer one sought\nrelief from the heat in the spacious living room with its ventilation\nshaft, which brought the cool north wind from the roof into the\ninterior of the various floors. The meals were taken where it was\nappropriate in accordance with the circumstances. There were no\nfixed tables surrounded by chairs; food was brought in from the\nkitchen on trays and put on movable low stools. Thus, whether\nresting or being with other people, one could enjoy either roominess\nor intimacy. But the emphasis was on space.\n\nAs the Geniza shows—and this aspect is its intrinsic contribu-\ntion—the High Middle Ages was a period of transition for the\nhistory of domestic architecture as it was in so many other respects.\nThe main constituents of the traditional Egyptian Arab house were\nalready in the making. The heritage of Late Antiquity, so far as it\nwas not absorbed in the new developments, had by now been dis-\ncarded. The famous Coptic Budge papyrus of Columbia University,\nwhich was written in early Islamic times, still lists as main parts of a\nhouse the dining room and the bedroom, using Greek terms.* Simi-\nlarly, Hebrew Midrashic literature, which continued to be written\nwell into the Islamic period, also using Greek words, constantly\n\nGoitein, S.

Moreover, the\nterminology of the Geniza is largely different from later usage, and\nthe change, most likely, was not merely a question of language. It is\nunavoidable, therefore, that I bother readers with a few archi-\ntectural terms; their indulgence is craved in advance. Without the\nidentification of terms one does not get a clear picture of how the\nhome of a middle-class family looked in Fatimid and Ayyubid times.\nAnd we cannot understand those people well without knowing\nsomething about their physical-environment, which was so impor-\ntant to them.

Notes on the need of repairs in houses and the expendi-\nture on them form a not infrequent topic in both family and business\nletters. Then there are reports about special events connected with\nhouses, for instance, accidents caused by structural defects, or the\ndamage or devastation resulting from earthquakes. With regard to\ncities for which we have no legal documents, such as Mosul, Iraq,\ndetailed references in letters are particularly welcome.\n\nOur main source, naturally, is the information to be gathered\nfrom legal documents and accounts. Deeds of sale hold the highest\nrank in this category, side by side with notes and drafts made for that\npurpose by court clerks or judges. The Geniza contains a consider-\nable number of such deeds written by Muslim notaries in Arabic\nscript. In most cases, they tell us about houses, or parts of houses,\nacquired by Jews from other Jews, or from Christians or Muslims.\nThere are also some items in which the two contracting partners are\nMuslims; we may assume the property concerned was later acquired\nby a Jew who received all the documents related to it, including that\nitem.\n\nGoitein, S.

The form of such a deed, abstracted from a number of actual\nexamples, has been published by G. Weiss and supplied with an\nEnglish translation.® An old and most detailed collection of Muslim\nforms for contracts of sale, the Shurit of Tahawi (ca. 853—933),\nedited by Jeanette A. Wakin, deals mainly with houses. The enor-\nmous diversity of cases reflected in those forms proves how much\nexperience had already been accumulated in these matters in the\nthird Islamic century.” Naturally, we are concerned here with the\ndescriptive details of a document rather than with its legal aspects,\nbut often the two are closely interconnected. To give an idea of the\ntype of information to be derived from this source, I enumerate the\nmain elements normally found in a Geniza deed for the purchase of\na house.\n\n1. Exact location of the property, often elaborately described\naccording to town, district, streets, and lanes.\n\n2. Its name, normally identified by the present proprietor, often\nplus that of a former, but better-known, proprietor or occupant.\nOccasionally, a house was known under a byname, such as “the\ngarden house,” or, “the house with the palm tree.”\n\n3. Its characteristic parts. Most contracts confine themselves to\nthe main architectural features, which give a general idea of the type\nof building sold. But some contain numerous details, leading the\nreader from the entrance door through all the corridors, court-\nyards, and rooms up to the roof, or, rather, roofs, which enables us\nto gain a complete picture of a place. Some deeds, both Muslim and\nJewish, contain the disappointing remark that, because of the\n“fame” of the building, no description or indication of its boundaries\nor other features is necessary.®\n\n4. The boundaries, mostly indicated by the names of streets or\npublic buildings and of persons to whom the adjacent houses be-\nlonged. From the sociological point of view, these details are often\nvery precious. Muslim deeds preserved in the Geniza list the borders\nin the order of south-north-east-west, starting with south, and many\nJewish records follow that custom. The sequence east-west-south-\nnorth and other sequences starting with east are equally frequent in\nJewish deeds, at least in those of the tenth and early eleventh centu-\nries. One remembers, of course, that south, the direction of Mecca,\nwas sacred to the Muslims, and east, to the Jews and Christians, but\nboth systems go back to pre-Islamic usages.®\n\n5.

In this case it was normally\nstated whether this share was all, or only a fraction, of the seller’s\nproperty, and who the other proprietors were; also, whether the\nhouse was “common and undivided,” that is, whether the share sold\nwas a percentage of its total value or represented an actual part of\nthe house. If the latter, this part, as well as its location and relation-\nship to other parts, was described. But it was the exception rather\nthan the rule. Normally, a house was evaluated as consisting of\ntwenty-four nominal shares and the purchase consisted in the acqui-\nsition of a certain number of them.'\n\n6. The price. In addition to the amount, the type of money\nreceived or to be paid is always exactly indicated. If the price was not\ndelivered in full at the transaction, details about payment of the\nbalance naturally would be given together with any conditions\nattached to it, for example, that the seller was permitted to live in the\nhouse until the balance was settled. Occasionally, the deed states\nwhether or not the price included a commission for the real estate\nbroker or any special bonus.!!\n\n7. Special conditions. In regular contracts, it is always stated,\noften with an enormous display of legal verbiage, that no conditions\nwhatsoever were attached to the sale, that the seller had reserved for\nhimself no rights, that the buyer might do with his newly acquired\nproperty whatever a proprietor is allowed to do, and that the entire\nproperty with all its appurtenances, rights, and privileges had been\ntransferred. Here again, and often in fine detail, the parts of the\nbuilding and the materials used for its construction are listed, but\nclearly these lengthy enumerations were taken from formularies\nrather than from actual descriptions provided by the parties. Still,\nthe very fact that these stereotyped specifications differ so much\nfrom one document to another proves that they were not entirely\ndivorced from reality. In this part it would also be stated whether the\nplot was included in the transfer or whether it belonged to the\ngovernment or to any other public authority, and what the amount\nwas of the “lease” to be paid for it. Special conditions normally\nconsisted of privileges granted to the seller or his family, especially\nthe right to buy the house back, in which case, of course, the neces-\nsary specifications had to be given. Or, a relative of the seller would\nrenounce the right of preemption in case part of a family property\nwas alienated.\n\nDeeds of gifts, wills, and donations of houses for philanthropic\nand religious purposes contain many of the elements found in deeds\nof sale.

For all these reasons, documents of this type compel strong\nhuman interest.\n\nContracts of lease, whether made out by Muslim or Jewish nota-\nries, usually contain only short descriptions of the property con-\ncerned and cannot be compared in this respect with deeds of sale.\nThey do show us how much people were prepared and able to spend\non their living quarters. In addition to the essential stipulations\nconcerning the duration of the rent and the amount and terms of\npayment, contracts of lease sometimes contain special conditions,\nfor example, whether the tenant is allowed to sublet the premises, or\nwho bears the cost of repairs.\n\nCourt records about disputes over houses and settlements made\nin such matters are another and most valuable source of informa-\ntion. As may be expected, an endless variety of situations is reflected\nin records of this type. Partitions agreed upon by relatives or part-\nners, claims arising from allegedly unpaid rent, or the pledging of a\nproperty as a collateral are more common cases. There are others,\nmore specific and complicated ones, such as a dossier about property\nfirst confiscated by a rapacious governor and subsequently en-\ncroached upon by a greedy relative; inspection by judges and gov-\nernment experts of a house tilting over the street and damaging the\nopposite building; or the submission of a long series of documents to\na court in order to prove a title of rights.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the documents pertaining to the groups\ndescribed have come down to us in an incomplete state.

Thus there existed no inducement for clip-\nping. Moreover, and most important, these accounts were disposed\nof in the Geniza not very long after they had been drawn up, for they\ncontained reports about revenue and expenditure for short periods,\noften only for a few months, and there was no purpose in preserving\nthem.

The situation is more favorable with regard to the elaborate\ncanal system (or, rather, systems) of the city. Scanlon’s diggings were\nvery instructive in this respect.\n\nSecond, as Scanlon has emphasized, the most central, populous,\nand important parts of ancient Fustat cannot be reached by excava-\ntions owing to the building up of that area from the mid-eighteenth\ncentury to the present day.'® The section unearthed is “somewhere\nin the area where al-‘Askar and Qatad’i‘ [two suburbs founded\naround 760 and 870, respectively] conjoined.” The network of\nstreets uncovered, with its lack of clearly identifiable thoroughfares,\nbetrays the suburban character of the neighborhoods. Those sub-\nurbs were situated on hard, rocky ground far away from the Nile,\nwhereas Fustat itself bordered on the river (before its shores partly\nsilted up). The drainage system uncovered by the excavators con-\nsisted of channels connecting one or several houses with a cesspool,\nwhich had to be emptied from time to time. The Geniza, however,\nmentions work on a drainpipe leading from a new house to the Nile\n(ca. 1037).** This item tallies with a treatise on health care by Ibn\nRidwan, a famous Cairene physician (998—1061), where he says\nabout Fustat: “Their lavatories empty into the Nile and sometimes\nobstruct the flow of the water. Thus they drink water mixed with\nthat putrid matter.””* The difference between the two systems was\nnot merely technical. Conducting drainage to the Nile necessitated\ncentralized direction and supervision to a far higher degree than\nrequired by a system of local cesspools.\n\nFinally, as Albert Gabriel himself observed, there is a blatant\ndiscrepancy between the findings of excavators and the descriptions\nof Fustat by competent observers visiting the city during the Fatimid\nperiod and earlier who speak about houses four, five, seven, and\neight stories high.*® In an often quoted passage the distinguished\nPersian author Nasir-i-Khosraw says that from afar the city looked\nlike a mountain, because it contained buildings between seven and\nfourteen stories high. Considering the flimsy foundations he un-\nearthed, Gabriel doubted whether most of the houses comprised\nmore than one story. Therefore, tentatively, Gabriel weighs the\npossibility, made a certainty by later findings, that the parts of the\ncity excavated by him and Aly Bahgat were different from those\nrepresented in the descriptions of medieval travelers.\n\nThe late A. Lézine, in a study on the persistence of pre-Islamic\ntraditions in the domestic architecture of Muslim Egypt, accepts the\ntestimony of such renowned medieval writers as Istakhri, Ibn\n\nGoitein, S.

Revault and B. Maury (Paris, 1975) is a most\nimportant contribution to the history of the traditional Cairene\nhouse.*\n\nTypes of houses.—From all that has been said on the preceding\npages it is evident that more than one type of house is represented in\nthe Geniza papers. Before trying to discuss them we must explore\nhow the very idea of “house” was expressed in Arabic and Hebrew,\nthe two languages mainly used in that source.\n\nThe Arabic word generally used for house was ddr, literally,\nenclosure, properly called thus because it could comprise several\nbuildings. The Hebrew equivalent hdsér, criginally, courtyard, con-\nveys the same idea, namely, that of a central court around which the\nbuildings would cluster.®® A document mentions “the building\nstanding in the dar”; others, one referring to Fustat, another to\nDamascus, speak of a dar within a dar; and an eighth-century\npapyrus lists “a shop in the dar of the church.” The term included\nmore than the built-up parts.*®\n\nFrequently, a house is defined as the large, comprehensive or\ncomplete dir, as when a Christian sells to a Jew 1 2/3 out of 24 shares\nin such a property, of which the latter already possessed 4 shares. We\nfind this usage both in Egypt and in Tunisia. The upper floor of\nsuch a “large house” in Qayrawin, given by a husband to his wife in\nFebruary 1040, cost 295 dinars.*’\n\nThen, too, our documents frequently describe a building as a\nduwayra, or small house. One such house, situated between the two\nsynagogues of Old Cairo, was sold in May 1124 for the low price of\n20 dinars. Another one, “located at the corner of the Street of the\nFurriers and the Little Market of the Tanners” in Aleppo, Syria, was\nestimated as having a value of only 30 dinars “because of the slump\nin the prices of real estate” around 1100, that is, when the Crusaders\nwere not far away. A third one, though, a garden house on the Nile,\nwas rented in July 1137 for 8 1/4 dinars per year, which presupposes\nthat the property itself was worth about 170 dinars. This price tallies\nwith that of another duwayra with a garden, which in 1233/4 was\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Even the one sold for 20 dinars comprised\ntwo upper floors, each containing a separate apartment, as well as a\nmustaraga, or loggia. The garden house on the Nile had an inner\ncourt with a fountain, a living room on the ground floor, and several\napartments on the upper story.*® Along with duwayra (which may be\nrendered by French maisonette or German Hduschen) the sources\nspeak also of al-dar al-saghira, the small house, especially when an\nadjacent large house is mentioned in the context. But this expression\nseems to be a matter of style rather than of typology.*®\n\nIn view of this usage of the term “a small house” we might expecta\nregular dar to have been quite a composite architectural creation.\nThere is, therefore, nothing strange in a letter addressed to one dar\nwithin another.* Great houses could break up and form a whole\nlane or quarter, as we find in two documents from Damascus from\nthe year 1094: “The dar which he built in the dar of Quzman which\nis in the dar known as the Sulphur Lane,” and “the stable in the city\nof Damascus, at the East Gate, in the quarter, hara, known as the dar\nof Quzman.”*\" This comprehensive meaning associated with the\nword dar explains why it was applied to large compounds serving\nadministrative and commercial purposes, as shown above,* and also\nwhy Arabic lacks a word for palace. The palace of a caliph, sultan, or\nvizier, whatever its dimensions, would simply be called dar.\n\nThe common Semitic word for house, bayt, which is used in this\nsense in Egypt today, has two different applications in the Geniza.\nAs a technical term, it denotes a room in both Arabic and Hebrew,\nand there is no difference with regard to this usage between the\ncapital of Egypt, a provincial town, Jerusalem, or Damascus.* In the\nfigurative sense, in expressing notions such as “the lady of the\nhouse,” or “household expenses,” bayt may stand for house, or,\nrather, family. Thus one would speak of dar bayt, the house of the\nfamily of so-and-so.**\n\nFinally, manzil, dwelling, so common as a term for house in the\nArabic papyri, and sukn, residence, have in the Geniza the more\nspecific meaning of living quarters, the room or rooms actually\noccupied by a person or a family, as opposed to dar, which denotes a\nstructure or compound. Words meaning place are used similarly.\nAttention to these shades of meaning is required for a proper\nunderstanding of the texts related to housing.*\n\nThe vast difference in price of properties changing hands at one\ntime and place (ranging from 20 to 800 dinars) confirms the as-\nsumption that houses differed not only in size and quality, butalso in\ntheir type and function.*®\n\nThe bazaar house, consisting of two stores topped by one or more\n\nGoitein, S.

W. Lane notes that in houses of this type the living quarters\nusually were reached by a separate entrance. The same is noted in a\nGeniza document. That the merchants or craftsmen operating\nthose stores did not necessarily live in the same house, but rented\ntheir business premises, is indeed evident from many documents\nspeaking about the rent of stores.*®\n\nFrom the bazaar house, which mostly served smaller enterprises,\nmust be differentiated the Nile-bank house. The Persian traveler\nNasir-i-Khosraw and other visitors pointed out, as a characteristic\ntrait of Fustat, that goods were unloaded from the Nile boats at the\nvery doorsteps of the shops. In a Geniza document written by a\nMuslim notary a foreign Jew purchases shares in a property from a\nChristian, which bordered on a Muslim house “with stores looking\non the embarkation place known as that of The Falcons, adjacent to\nthe gaysariyya of ‘Abd al-‘Aziz [also a Muslim], in which clothes are\nsold.” Here, the stores are called hawanit, originally designating a\nstructure of larger measures (not dakakin, retail shops, as usual); the\nword is in the plural, not dual; and the property forming the object\nof the transaction was a “comprehensive” one, situated in a presti-\ngious section of the Raya quarter, originally the center of the new\nArab city. These Nile-bank houses should be compared with the\ngreat mercantile mansions, as found in many other medieval cities,\nwhere the transport of goods was mainly done by water.*\n\nThe multistoried houses which, “according to hearsay” (as\nMugaddasi remarks), could accommodate up to two hundred peo-\nple, are represented in the Geniza by only one example, a house\nconsisting of one ground floor and nine upper stories, partly owned\nby a Jew.5* The word for story, used by both the Geniza documents\nand the Arab and Persian travelers describing Fustat, is tabaga,\nwhich, in the Geniza, at least, designates not only an upper floor but\nalso an apartment forming a part of it.*® Jews did not live in those\nfortress houses which harbored the large clans of which the Arab\ntribes settling in Fustat had been composed.

But the testimony of the early Muslim travelers, strengthened\nby the casual reference in the Geniza document, which presupposes\nthe existence of such huge buildings as something common, should\nnot be easily discarded. Paula Sanders drew my attention to a perti-\nnent story recorded by the Fatimid historian Ibn Zilaq (d. 996). A\nboy who was destined to become an eminent scholar fell from the\neighth story of a building, of which four stories “were in the open\nsky” (that is, were surrounded by buildings four or less stories high)\nand four near the ground. The boy plunged into an open well full of\nwater. He was badly crippled, but because of the water miraculously\nescaped death. In view of these and other realistic details in the\naccount, the story bears the stamp of truth. It happened prior to the\nconquest of Egypt by the Fatimids.>*\n\nThe types of houses which mainly occupy us are the family house,\nthat is, one built around a central court, and the apartment house,\nwhich usually consisted of three or more stories, as evidenced by\nactual documents and by the use of the terms “middle” and “upper\nfloors.” Here the question arises, whether the apartment house was\noriginally planned for the purpose of renting out, like the insulae of\nRoman and Late Antiquity, or was converted into such a structure by\nchanges made in a family home. The late Egyptian archaeologist\nAhmed Fakhri, who read the first draft of this chapter and wrote\nvaluable notes on it, insisted that medieval Egypt knew no insulae.\nThe evidence of the Geniza is not unequivocal in this respect. Still,\nwhen we read, for instance, that two partners (not relatives) built a\nnew house worth the extraordinarily high sum of 600 dinars, one\nwonders whether such a building was not conceived from the begin-\nning as a commercial enterprise.”\n\nThe house in the provincial capital of al-Mahalla described in the\ndocument translated at the end of this subsection consisted of three\nfloors (to which a fourth could be added), but it certainly had no\ninner open court, since one of the coproprietors retained the right to\nhang his laundry on the roof. Clearly, this provincial town house\nfrom the year 1121 already showed characteristics later fully devel-\noped in the houses of Rosetta.®\n\nFinally, it is worthy of note that a semirural Delta house like that\nin Minyat Ghamr, consisting of an unpaved court and three rooms,\nwas occupied by Jews, intrinsically urban people.*”\n\nFront and entrance.—In the following description of a dar, as it\nappears in the Geniza papers, we adopt the procedure of the deeds\nof sale, leading the reader from the doorway through the interior up\n\nGoitein, S.

References to open spaces outside a\nhouse and settlements made with regard to them are found in our\ndocuments.*® Walls were often shared with adjacent houses, which\ngave rise to lawsuits or agreements, when structural changes threat-\nened to increase the load borne by a wall.* In a narrow street, a\ntilting house could damage the front of an opposite building, and\nwhen a house possessed a sagifa, or portico, its breadth, protruding\ninto the street (in one case 1 1/6 cubits) was fixed by ordinance.®\nThe front of a house facing the street was called its face, wajh, and in\none instance we read that “the large wajh” of a house was built in one\nyear and the rest two years later. It tallies with the observation of the\nBaghdadian physician ‘Abd al-Latif that Egyptian architects would\nfinish each section of a house completely before starting another so\nthat people could move in immediately and use it. The Geniza\nreport precedes ‘Abd al-Latif by about two hundred years.®*\n\nDescriptions of entrances in the Geniza documents are very\nexplicit and profuse. Since the excavations have not furnished suffi-\ncient data for this architectural feature, and since the portal, this\nsymbol of hospitality, was as important in Islam as it was in antiquity,\nsome details about it may be welcome. The entrance to a larger\nhouse normally had an arched gateway with two door leaves (de-\nscribed as dark brown in one case), and when there were two gate-\nways, one would be arched and the other rectangular. Smaller\nhouses and those in provincial towns would have a rectangular\ngate.”” Houses bordering on several streets or lanes would have two\nor three entrances, in one case there were four, one doorway leading\ninto a caravansary erected by a Christian neighbor.®® In a house\nsituated in a business center, there could be three doors opening to\nthe main street, two of which served the shops, and one the private\nquarters.®* We read, albeit rarely, about a special gate leading to a\nstable, either directly or through an alley inside the dar.*® For rea-\nsons not easily evident, a house would have two doorways on the\nsame street, one opening as usual, into a corridor, and the other\ndirectly into the inner court, or gi‘a.*\n\nAny larger compound seems to have had a bab al-sirr, or secret\ndoor, “an entrance to a convenient secret passage, connecting the\nhouse directly with the street and thus allowing the master to escape\nfrom justice, vengeance, or assassination, or, conversely, according\nto the best authorities, to enable a paramour to enter the harim [or\nwomen’s quarters].” I should point out that I have frequently found\n\nGoitein, S.

Doorways to the women’s galleries of synagogues (and\nmost probably also of churches which possessed the same structural\ndetail) were designated by the same term but also by bab al-nisa,\nwomen’s entrance.®® Both in private and in public buildings the\nsecret door opened out to a street different from that approached\nthrough the main doorway.\n\nAn entrance door was equipped with a “ring,” presumably of iron\nor brass, serving as a knocker. “I stood there all the time, knocking\nthe rings, while the neighbors looked on, but he feigned not to\nhear.”® In one instance, we read about a bell. “The burglars broke\nthe street door. When they entered up to the bell door at the\ndomicile of the judge and broke it, we heard the noise.” This\naccount seems to indicate that in buildings inhabited by several\nfamilies, bells, perhaps of different sounds, were attached to the\ndoors of the apartments.” The locks of the doors were made of\nwood.™\n\nAbove the doorway and jutting out from the wall, sometimes\noccupying the whole breadth of the house, was the bay window, a\nkind of alcove allowing the inhabitants to comfortably observe what\nwas going on in the street. This arrangement, a bay window above\nthe main entrance, is still beautifully visible in the Sinniri mansion,\nfamed as the seat of the scientists accompanying Napoleon on his\nEgyptian expedition. The window balcony is usually referred to in\nthe Arabic Geniza texts by the Persian term rawshan, and in Hebrew\ndocuments by gezoztra, derived from the Greek exostra. I suspect that\nthe strange Arabic word ‘askar, used in this sense in several docu-\nments written by Muslim notaries, has the same Greek origin. The\nwindow balcony was an important part of the house, and the right of\npreserving its view was safeguarded in the contracts. Some houses\nhad more than one.”™ In one case we read about a rawshan protrud-\ning menacingly from the wall of a building under construction,\nfrightening the people walking beneath it. Even propping it up was\nno remedy for the nuisance caused. When the authorities (al-rayyis)\ndemanded its “lowering,” the proprietor claimed that it would en-\ndanger the entire building. Another case, illustrated by three court\nrecords, concerned bay windows of two confronting houses which\ntouched each other. (I saw just such an arrangement in the alfama, or\nOld City, of Lisbon, Portugal).

It could be constructed in the middle of a flight of stairs, asin a\nthree-story house in the provincial town of al-Mahalla belonging to\ntwo partners, wherefore it had to be stated whose property it was.™\nThe wooden latticework that screened the inhabitants of a house\nfrom the view of persons outside, never absent from a traditional\nMuslim house, has not yet been found mentioned in a Geniza docu-\nment, but perhaps there was no occasion to refer to it.\n\nBesides a window balcony, a house could have regular windows\nlooking on the street. That window was called taga, again a Persian\nterm. A deed from Old Cairo mentions a bay window and regular\nwindows together as being on the front side of a house, but a\ndocument from Damascus, describing the mansion of a prominent\nfamily, speaks of taqgas in a general way.” E. W. Lane reports that\neven at the beginning of the nineteenth century no windowpanes\nwere used in Cairo. A communal account from the year 1181 notes\nthat the replacement of a glass window cost 1 dirhem. It seems,\nhowever, that the reference is to a synagogue rather than to one of\nthe houses belonging to the pious foundations of the community.™\n\nThe front of a house could feature an “opening for the wind,”\nwhich was not meant to serve as a window, and, if submitted to\nstructural changes, would give rise to lawsuits.” A prisoner escaped\nthrough such an air hole, which suggests that usually it was placed\nhigh above the ground.” It was found also in upper floors, as in a\ndocument from the year 1285, where the living room in an upper\napartment had both windows and an “opening for the wind” in the\nwall opposite the entrance. The widely held view that the medieval\nEgyptian town house received its light exclusively from the inner\ncourt is not born out by our documents. Thus a settlement after\nmarital strife ended in an agreement that the wife would live in an\napartment looking on the inner court, and the husband’s parents\nand his sisters would occupy a separate apartment on another floor\nlooking on the street.”\n\nOpening the entrance door, one normally faced a dihliz, a cor-\nridor, or hallway. The descriptions also speak of hallways in the\nplural, or of a second hallway following the first. It shows that the\nentrance passage, wherever feasible, formed a turn, in order not to\nallow the visitor a look into the interior.* In better houses, the dihliz\nwould be paved with marble and contain one or two built-in benches,\ncalled mastaba, a word familiar to visitors to the country of the Nile as\nthe designation for tombs of the ancient Egyptian kings.*' These\nbenches served the gatekeepers.

The term has acquired in the course of time, and even within\nthe Geniza period itself, so many different facets of meanings that a\nshort discussion of its use in the Geniza documents is imperative.\nThere, qa‘a could denote three different things: (1) The ground\nfloor in general, as opposed to the ‘alw, the upper part, which\ncomprised all structures above the ground floor, whether they con-\nsisted of a number of floors and apartments, or of a single room.\nWhen used in this sense, qa‘a would be identical with sufl, the lower\npart. (2) A courtyard including the majlis, or living room, and all the\nother buildings surrounding it. Thus, in one and the same legal\ndocument, a tenant would be spoken of as having rented “the two\nqa‘as,” namely, the two courtyards including the buildings belong-\ning to them, and “the qa‘a,” which then would mean the ground\nfloor in its entirety.® (3) The courtyard proper as opposed to the\nbuilt-up sections of the dir. This usage is intended when we read\nthat a child fell from the arcade “into the qa<a,” or that a certain\nnumber of people were in the living room “and in the gi‘a even\nmore.”®®\n\nThe court normally was open to the sky. It could be large enough\nto comprise a garden: “He planted six trees in a garden in his house\nin the gaa” (ca. 1100).%” On the other hand, one deed dealing with\nthe transfer of a new house, describes it as having “a small qa‘a with a\ndecorative ceiling, a living room with two columns, as well as an upper\nfloor” (1157).% With regard to a house in al-Mahalla we learn about\nthe qi‘a “of the middle Aoor,” described as “suspended,” meaning\n“to be reached by steps” (1121).* It foreshadows the final develop-\nment of the term to designate the reception hall of the traditional\nEgyptian house.®\n\nI mentioned above a house with two qa‘as.

This should not be\nascribed to the fact that the separation of the sexes was not as strict in\nJudaism as in Islam. Houses frequently changed hands between\nmembers of the different religious communities, and in the numer-\nous documents from Fustat written by Muslim notaries no such\ndivision is visible.

For\nreasons of privacy, in both majlises the wind catchers had folding\ndoors with carved decorations, and in one there was a gilded wash-\nbasin nearby, certainly for the ablutions required after a night's rest.\nThe first majlis is described as longish, its walls covered with marble\nand its ceiling painted in oil “according to the Syrian fashion,” a\nluxury already castigated by the Prophet Jeremiah (22:14).

Elsewhere it is expressly stated that the vestibules had no\ndoors. The combination of a living room and two vestibules was so\ncommon that documents speak about a majlis with its two vestibules.\nThis floor plan probably was inherited from Late Antiquity.’*?\n\nAnother type of accessory room, and referred to even more\nfrequently than kumm, was the khizana, which we render as closet,\nbecause, like its English equivalent, it has the double meaning of\nboth a private room and a cupboard. The following examples lead\nto the conclusion that it could have been of considerable dimensions.\nA congregation intended to convert the khizina of its synagogue\ninto an open gallery with columns but refrained from doing so\nbecause the walls dividing it from the main hall were too thick. A\nplaintiff visited the chief Muslim judge in his khizina in the sultan’s\npalace, which could be translated here as office.

Finally, a rent of 12 dirhems per month, by no means a negli-\ngible sum, was paid to a brother for a khizana in a house that the\nlatter had received from his father as a gift.

Some khiiristins had doors of carved wood; others had no\ndoors at all.'*\n\nThe most characteristic part of the traditional Egyptian house,\nthe #wan, or lawan, a vaulted room, ofien several stories high and\nopen on one side to a central covered floor, is absent from the Geniza\ndocuments preceding the advent of the Mamluk period (1250). The\niwan, as Ahmed Fikri emphasized, was transplanted from Mesopo-\ntamia to Egypt during the Ayyubid period, and it takes time, of\ncourse, until a new house, through sale, gift, or rent, makes its\nappearance in a document.'*” Moreover, the introduction of those\nproud, princely vaults into Egypt marked the rise of a military\naristocracy, which was reared by the Ayyubids and took over the\ncountry under the Mamluks. The bourgeoisie emulated the condot-\nticres. But the adoption of those newfangled, costly structures was a\nslow process.\n\nThese changes are reflected in our documents. A Karaite deed of\nsale from the year 1260 first minutely describes a large house with\nseveral upper apartments and then adds: “The structures [on the\nground floor] have been removed with the exception of the gate of\nthe house, the majlis, and the washroom; likewise the upper rooms\non the front of the house have been replaced by a newly erected\niwan, which now faces the aforementioned majlis on the ground\nfloor (qa‘a), and a special entrance has been constructed leading to\nthree upper apartments.”®\n\nWe see here how things developed. Instead of two living rooms\nfacing each other, an iwin was built opposite the existing majlis, but\nthe layout remained the same as in the mansion of Fustat described\nbefore, where a large majlis was situated opposite a smaller one.**\nThe same arrangement, an iwan facing a majlis, was found in the\nnewly erected house that in September 1345 a Jewish physician gave\nto his son. Here we also find the diirga‘, that part of the inner floor\nwhere one slips off one’s shoes, which is one step lower than the\nrooms, an architectural detail that remained ubiquitous well into the\nnineteenth century.’® In order that the new house be really “com-\nplete” (as it is called in the document), the Jewish doctor provided “a\nwomen’s qa‘a” for his son’s house, the only such occurrence known\nto me from Fustat.'\"!\n\nOne of the more common features of the ga‘a, and in larger\nhouses, also of the upper apartments, was the suffa, from which is\nderived the English word sofa.

Two and\neven four suffas were in one place, and when we read about one on\nan upper floor which “looked on the lane,” or another, whose\n“ceiling was painted with oil,” it seems that a suffa still served also as\na bench.!*?\n\nAnother type of bench was the sidilla (the Latin sedilia, originally\nthe plural of sedile, a seat; in English, sedilia is a specific set of seatsina\nchurch reserved for clergymen when not officiating). With regard to\nthe traditional Egyptian house it has been described as “a platform\nof stone, about half a foot high . . . or a recess, of which the floor is\nsimilarly elevated and nearly equal in width and depth, with a\nmattress and cushions laid against one or two or each of its sides.” In\na document written about 1120, a sidilla faced the visitor when\nentering the uppermost floor. In another house a sidilla with marble\ncolumns stood in front of the living room of the ground floor. A\nthird document describes its location thus: “The water closet is\nadjacent to the sidilla which is situated opposite to the entrance to\nthis qa‘a. This sidilla is also adjoining a door through which one\nobtains access from the qa<a to its kitchen.” A “small sidilla” was\nadjacent to the kitchen in a fourth house. This placement induces us\nto assume that, unlike more modern use, repose during the day\nrather than social intercourse or nightly rest was the purpose of this\narchitectural feature.’?\n\nThe water basin and fountain of the gia‘a or the majlis were there\nto delight the eye and to refresh the air. The qi‘a regularly had also\na well providing water for cleaning purposes. In all descriptions of\nhouses the well is prominently mentioned. (Drinking water was\nbrought from the Nile by carriers.) Upstairs tenants had to obtain\nright of access to the qa‘a for the purpose of drawing water.!\"*\n\nIn Alexandria even a modest house had both a well and a cistern,\nand both, their repairs, or the brackishness or disappearance of\ntheir water are mentioned in letters.

In any larger house,\nboth were also found on upper floors, and we read about three\nupper apartments or a loggia, each of which had its separate wash-\nroom, commonplace for us, but very remarkable for those days. The\nfive terms used in English—washroom, water closet, bathroom,\nrestroom, and convenience—are all represented in the Arabic of the\nGeniza, in addition to the pre-Islamic Hebrew “room with a seat,”\nalthough probably no fixed seat was provided. In the house of a\nwell-to-do family the floor of the washroom was entirely paved with\nmarble and was topped by a copula with stucco work. The student of\nArabic and Hebrew literatures is reminded of the superb satire of\nthe Persian Arabic poet Hamadhani, successfully imitated by the\nSpanish Hebrew poet al-Harizi, in which a rich merchant is ridi-\nculed for bragging about his wonderful home, wife, and other\npossessions, climaxing his boasts by showing his guests his ultra-\nmodern bathroom with its glazed tiles.\"\"®\n\nThe uses of the ga‘a.—Our survey of the various components of a\nqa‘a and of their purposes leads to the conclusion that the qaa asa\nwhole served as the common link between the inhabitants of the\nrooms upstairs and between them and the outer world.

It was\nalmost the rule in buildings belonging to pious foundations, about\nwhich we have much information. In private homes, too, as the\nfamily expanded, sections of the qia were converted into separate\napartments.

An upper floor or story is\ncalled tabaqa, and where we read about a middle or uppermost\ntabaqas this meaning is assured; otherwise, however, the word may\ndenote an upstairs apartment. Thus, the house with nine tabaqas\nmentioned before was hardly one with nine upper stories, but one\nwith nine apartments on an unspecified number of floors.*® For a\nhouse with six “habitations,” masakin, in the part above the ground\nfloor we have two fragmentary documents, one, written around\n1095, in which the proprietor confirms having sold one-twelfth of it\n(the original document had been lost), and another where his step-\nson gives a quarter of the total to his paternal sister in June 1131.\nThe place is succinctly described as having loggias, columns, a\nwooden staircase, and a wooden parapet (around the roof), as well as\ntwo gates, one of which opened on the street opposite the Hujja\nmosque.'*® i\n\nA fuller description of a house with six upper habitations is\ntranslated at the end of this subsection.

Thus we see that even in the most\nancient part of Fustat an uppermost story could have been of a\nrather composite structure.'*®\n\nThe feature that one floor consisted of different levels remained\nalive in the traditional Egyptian house. “The apartments are gen-\nerally of different heights, so that a person has to ascend or descend\none, two, or more steps to pass from one chamber to another\nadjoining it.”*** The same was true of the Jewish house of San‘a,\nYemen, which was of the Mediterranean type and entirely different\nfrom the Arab fortress house indigenous to that country. Carl\nRathjens, that keen observer of material civilization, emphasizes that\nthis way of structuring upper floors was intentional, planned in\nadvance, and not the result of piecemeal building during different\nperiods.'* The height of a room was conditioned by its function. A\nspacious majlis had to be lofty, the small adjacent rooms would have\nlooked odd if they had been of the same height. As mentioned the\nphysician ‘Abd al-Latif, the visitor from Baghdad, observed that the\nEgyptian architect planned the entire building in advance, and that\nhe erected its different parts in accordance with the needs and\nwishes of the proprietor.'*!\n\nThis arrangement of the upper floors, which interrelated a room\nwith the ones beneath and above it, had legal effects. A house was\ndivided not only horizontally but also vertically, as attested by docu-\nments from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries for both\nFustat and other cities. The marital documents from Damascus\nfrom the year 933 relate that a groom possessed rooms on the\nground floor and an upper floor, forming one-sixth of the value of\nthe total building; that a bride received from her parents, in addition\nto a trousseau worth 260 dinars, one room in each of the ground and\nmiddle floors estimated as representing one-eighth of the value of\nthe house; the other proprietors, bordering on her share, are\nlisted.’* A bride in very modest circumstances, whose outfit was\nworth only 30 dinars, brought in “the majlis at the entrance of the\nhouse with its cabinet and upper floor and the right to build on top\nof it whatever she liked”; the relevant document is from the second\npart of the eleventh century.'*® Of particular interest is a deed of sale\nwritten in 1088 by a Muslim notary, where parts of a second floor\nexempted from the sale are described as being “above the entrance\nhall, the straw storeroom, and the vault west of the southern room of\nthe qa‘a.”*** In a question addressed to Maimonides from Alexan-\n\nGoitein, S.

The first is the tarma, which should by no means be\nidentified with the Iragian structure bearing this name, a kind of\nportico or peristyle, often referred to in studies on Islamic archi-\ntecture.\"*® In Egypt, the tarma was “a room made of timber,” ac-\ncording to a competent Muslim historian, which tallies with Mai-\nmonides’ note that it was the name of the cabin in (or perhaps rather\nupon) a boat.\"® In the Geniza documents it is a wooden structure on\ntop of a tabaqa and serves as a complete dwelling place. The follow-\ning quotations are illustrative. A settlement between relatives made\nin 1133 stipulates: “Abu ’I-Fadl will live in the empty tarma of the\nhouse, while the tabaqa beneath it will be occupied by his niece.” Ina\nletter written in January 1148, a son in Old Cairo complains to his\nfather traveling on the route to India: “Life in the tarma is un-\npleasant because of the toil of ascending staircases and the noise of\nthe mortars”—a reference to the women preparing meals on the\nroofs extending from their tabaqas. Thirteenth-century deposition\nin court states that the uppermost tabaqa of a certain house and the\ntirma above it were property of the community.

It\nseems to have had a function similar to that of the mag‘ad (meaning\nplace where one sits) in the traditional Egyptian house. The maq‘ad\nhas been described as a “room generally elevated about eight or ten\nfeet above the ground floor, having an open front, with two or more\narches and a low railing.” In the Middle Ages such a structure was\ncalled mustaraqa, the filched one, meaning taken away from the\nspace of one of the upper stories. It was mostly open to the north,\nand, when used as a place of habitation, was screened off by a\nwooden lattice.\"** This strange architectural term has its counter-\npart in South Arabian usage.'** A few quotations clarify the mus-\ntaraqa’s location. “Opposite the entrance to the qa‘a there is a door\nleading to its kitchen and to its women’s ga‘a, as well as to a staircase\nmade of stone, on which one ascends to the roof of the women’s qa‘a\nand to the mustaraqa which belongs to it.”*** “The house also com-\nprises a kitchen and two mustaraqas, which overlook the court of its\nqa‘a.”\"** “The house has two adjacent mustaraqas, one giving a view\non the entrance door and the other on the qa‘a.”**® The variety of\nlocations explains perhaps why we read in one deed of an “inside\nmustaraqa.”**’ One description speaks of mustaragas in the plural\n(not the dual), and another situates one between two upper sto-\nries.'*® In one legal deed a mustaraqa is rented out together with the\nqa‘a; in another it is combined with an upper floor; a third states that\nit was added to the second floor; and we also find one above a third\nfloor. In houses belonging to pious foundations the rental of a\nmustaraqa alone, no doubt partly screened off by some lighter\nconstruction, was commonplace (as from the eleventh century).'*\n\nThe riwag (a Persian word), or arcade, must have been an impor-\ntant structure in Syrian houses, since it is mentioned in documents\nfrom both Damascus and Tyre as having remained common prop-\nerty after other parts of the homes concerned had been divided\nbetween partners.'*® In Egypt it appears once as facing the street, in\na letter as above a courtyard, and is even mentioned as a structure\nwithin a majlis.

The excavator of Fustat, A. Gabriel, concluded from the\nscant remnants that the staircases were never treated in a monu-\nmental way. Frequently reference is made to “staircases on arches of\nstone,” and, in one letter, the landing of a staircase was large enough\nto accommodate four men and one woman. In apartment houses,\nsmall or large, the staircase was in the first corridor, the one near the\nmain doorway; in a family mansion it was in the innermost part of\nthe house, to be reached through a door opposite the entrance to the\nqa‘a. We hear also about one or two staircases connecting two\nhouses. Repairs of one or more steps were a regular item in the\nexpenditure accounts for buildings belonging to the community. A\nfather writing home expresses concern that the children may incur\nharm while going up the staircases.

But when, in\na court record from September 1093, a man accuses his brother of\nhaving removed from the matmiira of the family Arabic books on\nmedicine, reams of paper, fifty pounds of mercury, and gold coins,\none would rather assume that this matmura was built in a hidden\ncorner of the maze of rooms on a ground floor, or even on an upper\nstory, or between stories (as in Yemenite houses). Such a “treasure\nroom” is a regular feature in the stereotyped descriptions of houses\nfound in deeds of transfer.'*\n\nA compartment named kandij makes its appearance in the docu-\nments from the first half of the twelfth century. It is described as\nfixed on top of a closet, a wall cupboard, a kitchen, or a staircase, or\naccessible from two adjacent rooms. In a deed of gift of half a house,\nwritten around 1140, the giver stipulated that the kandiij would be\nopen on the recipient’s side, as long as he remained in possession of\nhis half, but if he alienated it, the compartment would revert to the\nexclusive use of the original proprietor.

Ina\ndeed from Tyre the makhzan was beneath the majlis, or living\nroom; in Damietta, the Egyptian seaport, a makhzan was located ina\ndihliz, or entrance hall. (A jug containing a thousand gold pieces was\ndiscovered there and, of course, confiscated by the government.) In\na house in the al-Mamsiisa quarter of Fustat, converted into work-\nshops, each side of the dihliz had a makhzan whose ceiling was made\nof palm trunks and acacia wood. A makhzan could also form a\nseparate building.

Socioeconomic Aspects of Housing\n\nOuwnership.—The preceding study of domestic architecture\nnecessarily touched upon many matters exemplifying what a house\nmeant for its inhabitants and what type of life it presupposed or was\nable to sustain. This section is specifically devoted to these topics and\ndiscusses also the more technical aspects of urban dwelling.\n\nHousing, as reflected in the Geniza, displays a polarity charac-\nteristic of a society that was enterprising, mercantile, and mobile,\nand, at the same time, tradition bound and clannish. Ideally, and\nvery often actually, various branches of an extended family lived in\none house, and frequently adjacent houses were in the possession of\nrelatives or of one person. Occasionally, marriages between cousins\nor other close relatives were concluded in order to reunite proper-\nties which had become divided through the process of inheritance.\nIn short, housing was organized so as to secure the coherence of the\nextended family.!\n\nOn the other hand, numerous documents tell about young\ncouples living in rented premises or otherwise away from the family.\nAs a rule, a house was treated as a monetary unit. At transactions,\nsuch as gifts, sales, or bequests, usually it was not divided physically,\nbut according to nominal shares. These shares frequently changed\nhands. Partnerships with outsiders, even members of another rel:-\ngion, were common. The right of preemption, intended to keep\naliens out, was often waived or disregarded. The tension between\nthese two opposing tendencies of family cohesion and mobility gave\nrise to the many contracts, lawsuits, and settlements with regard to\nhouses that are recorded in the Geniza papers.\n\nWith few exceptions, documents, whether issued by Muslim or by\nJewish authorities, describe the houses concerned as being “held in\nJjoint, undivided ownership.” This means that the parts of a house\nwhich formed the object of a contract were units of account, not real\nsegments of a building. A house was divided into twenty-four nomi-\nnal shares, a division modeled on the twenty-four qirits, or parts, of\nthe dinar, the same division adopted in the apportioning of an\ninheritance in Islamic law. The shares transferred by sale or gift\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Shares of\n1/18, 1/16, 1/9, or 1/8 were commonplace.® Yet, the majority of the\ntransactions recorded concerned portions of a house amounting to\n1/6, 1/4, or more, which means that they normally were large\nenough to form separate residences. In any case, we see that the\ninstitution of partnership, which in those days dominated com-\nmerce, finance, industry, and employment, also prevailed in the\nownership of houses.*\n\nUrban property was an important form of investment. A phy-\nsician owned, in addition to 2/3 of one house, which also served as his\ndomicile, shares of 1/2, 1/3, and 1/8 in other houses, two of which\nwere facing, and the two others were side by side.® A woman mar-\nried for the second time possessed in full the house in which she\nlived with her first husband, as well as a ruin opposite it, and, in\naddition, held shares of 1/4 and 1/8 in houses in other parts of town.®\nA Tunisian merchant who lived in Alexandria possessed two houses\nin Fustat, the income from which, after deduction of the costs of\nmaintenance, was regularly remitted to him.” When the widow of an\nIndia trader acquires 1/6 of two shops, the total value of which\nexceeded 300 dinars, one can hardly see in this step anything other\nthan a means of investment. The same applies to the father-in-law of\nthis woman, also an India trader, who bought a large house worth\n500 dinars, letting most of it to others, while purchasing, approx-\nimately at the same time, half of another for 300 dinars, and retain-\ning the former proprietor of that half as a tenant.®* When a bride\nreceives from her parents shares in a house, more often than not the\ncircumstances prove that the property given did serve as a source of\nincome rather than as the residence of the young couple, see Med.\nSoc., 111, 519, s.v. “Residence.”\n\nWhen a house was occupied by a number of parties, the actual\ndivision of the premises and the conditions entailed by it had to be\nagreed upon. The contract concerning the three-story house in the\nprovincial town of al-Mahalla, translated above, may serve as an\nexample for so comprehensive an agreement.

Such a situation referring to the families of\nthree cousins is described in a letter submitted to Moses\nMaimonides.\"* Naturally, the legal inquiry became necessary only\nwhen the three began to quarrel. There was even a more ingenious\ntype of arrangement: In order to give all partners the opportunity of\nenjoying, at least temporarily, the amenities of the best section of a\nhouse, relatives would rotate year by year from one floor, or one part\nof the house, to the other. An agreement of this type is mentioned in\nanother question submitted to Maimonides, and we have an actual\ncontract to this effect from the city of Tyre on the Lebanese coast\nmade in, or around 1196. Strange as the arrangement may appear to\nus, it shows how much care was taken to avoid squabbles between\nmembers of a family who were joint owners of a house. We read\nabout bitter and prolonged lawsuits over similar matters. One\nmagnificently written Hebrew fragment, written around 1000,\ndescribes the vicissitudes of a contention about the use of the main\nhall of a house. One entrance was walled up; on another a board was\nnailed and the rights of the parties were defined. When one of the\nrelatives tried to obtain the removal of that board by bribing a\nMuslim judge, Shemarya, then the rav, or highest religious authority\nof the Jewish community, was approached, the results of which are\nnot preserved.'?\n\nExamples of precautionary measures taken for the same purpose\nabound in the Geniza.

This manzil, however, and that inhabited\nby her brother are expressly described as being the property of the\nfather.\"” The following, somewhat complicated case is particularly\nnoteworthy. A man married a widow who brought in as her mar-\nriage portion one-sixth of a house. She shared this house with the\nchildren of her late husband and a Muslim partner. The new couple\nmoved into a tabaga, or apartment, on an upper floor. The husband\nwas afraid that the other partners might claim that the living quar-\nters actually occupied by him represented more than one-sixth of\nthe total value of the house. Therefore, his wife stood security with\nher share in the property for all claims on rent which might be raised\nagainst her husband.™ A similar case, where the actual occupation\nby the member of a family exceeded a nominal sixth, with the\nconsequence that a partial rent was paid by him to his relatives, is\nreported below.\"®\n\nIncome from real estate was regarded by great merchants as an\ninvestment inferior to that derived from commerce.

For the rank and file of the\nmiddie class, however, urban property, which could be easily super-\nvised, seems to have formed the favorite choice for securing a steady\nflow of revenue, true especially for women, who, with the exception\nof the poor, normally did not earn money by work.\n\nPerhaps one-half, if not the majority, of the proprietors of houses\nappearing in the Geniza were women. Fathers and mothers would\ngive their daughters one or several houses or, more frequently,\nshares in them, at the time of their marriage, or at any other time, in\norder to ensure their economic security and independence. A hus-\nband would leave his wife real estate as payment of what he owed her\nas deferred installment of the marriage gift. When a childless old\nwoman, among other things, left to her nephews a new house, she\nhad probably acquired it not long before her death because she\nregarded it as the safest form of preserving her savings. Gold, silver,\nor jewelry could be stolen. The house was registered with the\nauthorities.\"®\n\nThe possession of real estate was a necessity also for the pursuit of\nregular economic activities. If one wished to contractaloan, one had\nto have a house, which could serve as collateral. This situation is\nparticularly well illustrated in a document dated March 969. A few\nmonths earlier a woman and her husband had borrowed 50 dinars\nfrom a physician and had mortgaged for this loan a house which she\nhad inherited from her father. In March 969, the couple needed\nthat house, presumably for taking an additional loan from someone\nelse. Therefore, they pledged to the physician another house, adja-\ncent to the first and most probably given to her as part of her\nmarriage portion.'” It stands to reason that the value of a house\ngiven as collateral usually was higher than the sum taken as aloan. A\nglassmaker pledged his house, which had already changed owner\nthree times, for a loan of only 10 dinars, an amount found only\nexceptionally as the price of a house in the capital of Egypt.'®\n\nThere is no need to emphasize that the most common incentives\nfor the building or acquisition of a home were family adherence and\nsocial status. Houses had no numbers in those days. They bore the\nnames of their proprietors, and often also (or solely) that of a\nprevious owner, if it was he who had made the house “famous.” “Oh\nmy house, you concealer [Ar. satir] of my deficiencies,” says an\nall-Arabic maxim; the term mastir, respectable, which occupies us\nlater, has much to do with the proprietorship of a home.”® A man\nbuilt a new house not so much for himself as with the intention of\nproviding a shelter for his progeny.

In the villages, as the papyri from the Egyptian\nLibrary published by Adolf Grohmann disclose, one could have a\ncomplete house for less than 1 dinar, and prices of 4 to 5 dinars were\ncommonplace. An Arabic fragment from the caves of Murabba‘at\non the Dead Sea, edited by the same author, concerns the sale of a\nhouse for 1 dinar. In the Geniza, similar cases are exceptional and\nobscured by complicated circumstances, as when a man had to\npledge 3/4 of a house and 1/2 of a ruin belonging to him against a\ndebt of 6 dinars which he owed to an orphan. Presumably his house\nalso was more like a ruin. The name of the place where these\nproperties were situated has not been preserved.?\n\nFor smaller provincial towns, such as Sahrajt, Malij, and\nUshmunayn, houses worth 10, 11, 12, and 17 dinars, respectively,\nhave been attested in the Geniza records and in a papyrus from the\nEgyptian Library. In 998, in one small place in the Nile Delta,\nal-Bana, near the town of Faqus, a woman sold one-twelfth of a\nhouse to her son-in-law for 3 1/2 dinars, which makes a total value of\n42 dinars.\n\nThe most modest houses in the capital cost between 20 and 40\ndinars. Prices of 20, 36, and 40 dinars have been found twice, and if\nwe include the few documents from the Mamluk period (the second\nhalf of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries), the sum of 500\nnugra silver, whose actual value corresponded at that time to approx-\nimately 25 dinars, has twice been ascertained. Prices of these\namounts perhaps were standard for modest habitations.*'\n\nThe two groups, of houses worth around 60 and 120 dinars,\nrespectively, are represented in the Geniza by a large number of\ndocuments. These groups seem to comprise houses occupied by the\nbroad mass of the lower and middle classes, for example, craftsmen,\nschoolmasters, and local shopkeepers.\n\nA merchant engaged in international trade or a physician would\nbuy for himself a home worth 200 or 300 dinars or more.

The upper crust of society—government officials and\nthe like—would live in houses worth 600 to 800 dinars, and we are\nfortunate in possessing a most detailed description of a house cost-\ning 729 dinars. The details given in Appendix A show that specific\ncircumstances prevailed in many cases of sales. Attention should be\npaid to this fact by anyone undertaking to evaluate the prices listed\nthere.’\n\nAn important feature of the transfer of houses was the right\nfrequently given to the seller and to his heirs to buy the sold property\nback when they were able and willing to do so. The periods stipu-\nlated for repurchase, although sometimes short (in one case only\nseven months), were usually of considerable length, amounting to\nfour, five, ten, and even twelve years. It indicates that houses, or\nparts of them, were often sold only as a last resort in situations of\nextreme need, as when a debtor was unable to pay back a loan.*\n\nIn all cases in which the right of redemption was extended for\nseveral years, the seller continued to live in his place and paid rent to\nthe buyer. Arrangements of this legal character are foreseen in the\nTalmud and are commonplace in Islamic law.*® When, in such\ncircumstances, the rent was exorbitant, veiled interest was clearly\nimplied, but not always, as the Geniza proves. In a deed from\nAlexandria, dated 1103, two Jewish partners bought half a house\nfor 60 dinars and granted the Muslim seller the right to live in it for\nten years against a yearly rent of 3 dinars. Until the end of that\nperiod he had the right to buy his half back. If he was unable to do so,\nthe buyers would sell their share but return to him any amount in\nexcess of the 60 dinars originaily paid by him. A yearly rent worth 5\npercent of the value of a property was modest, and the additional\nstipulation that any profit accruing from the sale would revert to the\noriginal proprietor shows that the buyers must have had a reason for\nextending help to the Muslim, who bore the honorific title The\nVenerable.\n\nThe element of consideration was present also when Abraham\nMaimonides, the Nagid, or Head, of the Jewish community of\nEgypt, was granted in 1213/4 the right to repurchase the burj, a\ntower in the ancient Byzantine fortress of Fustat, for 60 dinars overa\nperiod of five years, or, when, in 1246, two plus one out of twenty-\nfour shares of a property near the Great Bazaar, purchased for a\ntotal of 42 dinars, were given the same privilege for a duration of\nthree years. In both instances the rent was waived, so that one gets\nthe impression that the purchase was in reality a loan with collateral\nbut without interest. When, however, in 1229, a dyer, the son of a\ndyer, conceded a similar privilege to a fellow artisan (who, like his\n\nGoitein, S. D.

In addition, the seller-tenant had\nto pay the government tax, the watchmen, and for garbage\nremoval—all duties normally incumbent on the proprietor—\nmaking a total of about 16 percent of the value of the property to be\npaid per year. The transactions described in Med. Soc., 1, 384, sec. 65\n(twelve years, and about 16 percent, Bilbays 1239) and III, 329\n(1123/4) were of a similar character.

Thus a woman\non her deathbed freed her two slave girls and gave them a part of\none house as a place to live and a part of another as a source of\nmaintenance for the rest of their lives.*® There were, however, many\nother types of gifts, especially those illustrating that houses fulfilled\nin those days to a large extent the role life insurance does today. An\nold woman gave to a trustworthy person the upper floor of a house\nagainst the obligation to supply her with food and clothing during\nher lifetime.?” A man, obviously a widower, made a gift of a small\nhouse to a woman on condition that she look after him until his\ndeath.?® One house in one case and two houses in another were given\nto women, with the stipulation that they provide the donors with\nproper funeral attire and a fine burial.

One would donate the whole or part of a house for\nthe upkeep or lighting of a synagogue, for the poor in general, or for\nspecified groups, such as the poor, the scholars of Jerusalem, or the\ncopying of a Torah scroll or the education of orphan boys. Wagf or\nsadagqa, as pious foundations were called in Arabic, hegdésh, or more\nfrequently, godesh, as they were named in Hebrew, played a signi-\nficant role in the disposition of houses.

Thus, one document tells us about a man\nwho had inherited half a house from his mother, and, before dedi-\ncating it to the two synagogues of Fustat, purchased the remaining\nhalf for that purpose.®' Very frequently, however, only part of a\nhouse, such as one-third or one-quarter, would be turned over to a\npious foundation, even when the donor owned the entire property.\nSince income from houses was derived from rent, it must have been\na common practice for a family house to be occupied partly by\nmembers of the family, or the donor himself, and partly by tenants.\nThis parceling of a house into some sections devoted to pious\npurposes and others given to various relatives or other persons is\nwell illustrated by the deathbed declaration of a woman made in\nNovember 1006, in which she willed one-sixth of her house to each\nof the two synagogues of Fustat and another three-sixths to a\nbrother, a niece, and a girl (in order to enable her to marry). The\nvalue of one-twelfth had already been spent for repairs, and the\nremaining twelfth was earmarked for the transportation of the\ntestator’s body to Palestine for interment in the Holy City. In or\naround 1161 a woman donated one-quarter of a house, which she\nheld in partnership with another proprietor, “to the poor” and\none-sixth to a person not described as her relative. In a court record\ndated 1186, a woman shares with other tenants a house which she\nhad donated to a pious foundation, paying rent to the latter for the\npremises occupied by her. People must have been accustomed to\nbeing crowded together with others in the same house.*\n\nThe transfer of a property took place in two stages: the first when\nthe sale, gift, or settlement was made before a court or a notary\nassisted by at least one witness, and the second when the property\nwas registered in the name of the new proprietor with the Muslim\nand normally also the Jewish authorities. In the first act, all the deeds\nrelating to the object, “both Arabic and Hebrew,” were handed over\nto the new proprietor and the promise was given that it would be\nproperly registered. This procedure is evident in numerous docu-\nments. When the house sold was located in another city the buyer\nhad to confirm that he had inspected it.* Since registration with the\ngovernment authorities was obligatory, one wonders why the parties\nwere eager to obtain also a “Hebrew deed” with regard to the\ntransfer of a property and often made the actual transaction before\na Jewish court. The answer seems to be that a husband used as\nsecurity his possessions for the sums due his wife at his death or in\nthe case of divorce.

This sum may represent, at least in part, also\na remuneration for an agent. It is, however, more likely that with\n“charges,” as common in business accounts, payments to the govern-\nment are intended. A similar transfer tax of something around 3\npercent is noted in a court record written on June 22, 1145. The\nprice of the property, a house in the al-Mamsisa quarter, was 123\ndinars, “the charges,”'3 7/12 dinars (“one-third and one-fourth”),\nand the payment to the agent, 4 1/2 dinars.

A Tunisian merchant, before setting out\nfrom Alexandria to the capital, writes to his business correspondent:\n“Please rent me an apartment, a clean place, even if the rent be high.\nI do not care. I like a clean place. Choose it wherever you like and\nlock it. May God prolong your life.” Obviously this man had had bad\nexperiences in previous similar situations.* In a letter from Fustat,\nthe writer, after having expressed regret that the addressee had not\naccepted his offer to put him up as long as he wished, reports about\nthe apartment chosen: “The place is near the ‘House of Ibn Raja’ [a\nwell-known wakala, or caravanserai], before one comes to the\nentrance of Ibn Raja’s portico. It is an upper story in the rear section\nof the house. No one else lives on the same floor. The people living\nbeneath that apartment are foreigners who keep to themselves.\nThey do not ask questions about anyone and nothing you say would\nbe heard or known. The only trouble is—that they are women.”\nHere the letter ends abruptly. The writer must have had second\nthoughts about the propriety or desirability of such neighbors.**\nWhen a merchant had a house in Alexandria and an “upper floor”\nin Fustat, the latter might well have been rented. In view of the bad\ntimes, he asked a business friend to sublet the Fustat apartment.*\n\nThe great mobility of the Mediterranean populace, described in\nMed. Soc., 1,42—70, explains why many families were forced to make\nuse of rented apartments. Nahray b. Nissim, the Qayrawanese mer-\nchant and scholar, was active in Egypt from 1045 on. In 1066 he still\nlived in a sixth of a house which belonged to the family of his\nEgyptian wife, and was prepared to pay a dinar per month for rooms\noccupied by him in excess of this sixth.** In between these two dates\nhe wrote, in a postscript added to a letter of another Tunisian: “I\ntook a ga‘a [ground floor] in the Fortress of the Candles and shall\nmove there on the first of next month—may God make the move a\n\nGoitein, S.

The detailed stipulations about\nprospective changes in the residence of the newly married, so com-\nmonly found in Jewish (and Muslim) marriage contracts are an\nindication of the frequency of such occurrences. Young couples, as\nthe Geniza documents prove, often had to be content with a rented\napartment.* Inheritance was another and more frequent cause of\nrenting. When a property was split into units too small for a comfor-\ntable residence, heirs wishing to remain or to move into a house\naffected by partition had to pay rent to those who had become\ncoproprietors.\n\nLast, but not least, large sections of the population were poor and\nunable to acquire homes for themselves. The enormous develop-\nment of the institution of pious foundations, that is, the donation of\nhouses for charitable purposes, described in Med. Soc., 11, 112—121,\npresupposes the existence of an extensive clientele in need of hous-\ning. It must have been common practice to let part of a family home,\nas is evident from referpnces in letters, from documents, and the\npractice of donating only part of a house to a pious foundation.*\nMoreover, renting an apartment house seems also to have been a\nform of commercial undertaking. In December 1032, a Muslim\nrented from a Jew a house in Khawlin quarter of Fustat with the\nright to sublet. This house consisted of two apartments on the\nground floor, two on the upper floor, and three light constructions\n(akhsas), each forming a separate habitation. It sounds as if, from the\noutset, the house was rented as a source of income rather than a\nplace to live. The acquisition of real estate as a source of income\nfrom its rent to be used for the support of orphans was\ncommonplace.®\n\nThe duration of a renting period was short, sometimes only six\nmonths, but mostly one lunar year.* The start of the period in\nMuharram, the first month of the Muslim year, is attested, but was\n\nGoitein, S.

A person who lived in his brother’s house for\nmore than thirty years renewed the contract every second year.**\nLonger periods of rent, such as four years, were exceptional and\nowed to specific circumstances; thus the administrator of the prop-\nerty of the mosques in the Egyptian capital let a garden house on the\nNile for that period. Even in this instance, payment was made at the\nend of each month, which was the usual procedure in most cases.\nTwice a quarter of a house was let to relatives for the five years; in\none instance, for a monthly rent of 1 1/2 dirhems, in another, for a\nrubat, or 1/4 dinar, about 9—10 dirhems.*\n\nArrears, naturally, did occur, especially among poorer tenants,\nbut to a lesser degree than one would expect. Hence the strong\ncontractual warning, even in an agreement with a relative, to pay at\nthe end of every month “without procrastination and excuses.” At\ncertain times it seems to have been customary to set four months as\nthe ultimate limit for the accumulation of debts from the monthly\nrents.*\n\nWhen the rent was paid in advance, a certain discount was\ngranted. An Adenese merchant advanced in 1186 100 dirhems for\nan apartment on an upper floor, for which he presumably would\nhave had to pay 10 dirhems per month if he had paid in installments.\nAn advance payment of 6 3/4 dinars for a place used as a reservoir of\nrose oil during two years also gives the impression of being the result\nof a reduction.”\n\nThe rates of rent are richly documented in the Geniza texts.\nDetailed accounts of revenue from houses owned by pious founda-\ntions enable us to study the development of the rates of rent during\ntwo hundred years (1040—1250 approximately), and there are\nmany details to be learned on the subject from sundry documents\nreferring to residences owned by private persons. We must bear in\nmind that the lists of communal revenues record actual payments.\nSince arrears occurred, the sums given do not always represent the\ntotal rent. Yet the information contained in these accounts is so\nabundant and variegated that, with a certain measure of circum-\nspection, one is able to determine the full amounts of the average\nrents stipulated. Second, one would expect houses given to pious\nfoundations to be in such a state that only the poorest would choose\nto live in them. It was true, however, only with respect to some\nhouses, in particular those which served many parties, mostly single\nor old people, who occupied only one room each. In general, the\namounts of rents discernible in documents concerning communal\nhouses did not differ substantially from those of privately owned\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Therefore these two sources of information may be regarded\nas complementary and used accordingly.*\n\nIn Appendix B are analyzed representative accounts of pious\nfoundations from the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. A\ncomparison of that material with sources dealing with houses be-\nlonging to private proprietors leads to these conclusions: People in\nvery modest circumstances paid for their living quarters 4—6 dir-\nhems per month, approximately 60 a year, which corresponded to\nabout 1 1/2 dinars. The Geniza has preserved a lease for an apart-\nment belonging to the community for 5 dirhems per month, and one\nof an entire private house in a provincial town for 6 dirhems. In the\nlatter case the tenant also had to pay the night watchmen.® In a\nquery addressed to Maimonides, a quarter of a house (dar) is let for 1\n1/2 dirhems, which presupposes a total of about 5 dirhems, since one\nhad to pay relatively more for a part than for an entire property.*\nAn Arabic papyrus gives 1 1/6 dinars as a yearly rent, also in a\nprovincial town, but from the ninth century.® The rent of 1/6 dinar\nper month, or 2 dinars a year, also belongs here.®\n\nAnother, even poorer, group is conspicuous in the lists discussed,\nthose who paid an average rent of 2 1/2 dirhems per month. The\nfrequent occurrence of the names of women in this category induces\nus to assume tha: these premises were mostly occupied by single\npersons and not by families. [n a letter to a communal authority, a\nwoman complains that her rent was raised from 2 to 3 1/2 dirhems,\nalthough the place was very modest and shared by her only with her\nson who was away all the day at work. A 1/4 dinar as the yearly rent\nof a house belonging to the Jewish community of Ascalon, Palestine,\nduring a period of about fifteen years is entirely exceptional. No\ndoubt the tenant made repairs in the house, in recognition of which\nhe was granted this token payment for an extended period.*® The\nlower middle class spent 9—12 dirhems, or 1/4—1/3 dinars, per\nmonth on rent, which equals 3—4 dinars a year. Instances of this are\nfound in the lists in Appendix B. A yearly rent of 3 dinars with\nregard to Alexandria 1103 and an advance payment of 100 dirhems\nrepresenting a yearly rent of the same amount for Fustat 1186 have\nbeen discussed earlier.®* An India trader, while away, leased a house\nto his brother for 12 dirhems a month, approximately 4 dinars per\nyear, a sum paid for a complete house in Fustat according to a\nfragmentary contract in Arabic characters.*®® A khizana, or closet,\nwhich was rented for 12 dirhems a month from a brother, also\nbelongs to this category.

We\nfind this sum stipulated in a marriage contract which fixes 50 dinars\nas a fine for default in fulfillment of any of the conditions of the\ncontract—a very high sum for a fine.*” An entire house with a\ngarden could be had for 5 dinars per year in Alexandria 1132, and\nin the same city, in 1165, a house was let for 9 dinars for two years,\nwhich corresponds to a yearly rent of approximately the same\namount. A house in Jerusalem was rented for 5—6 dinars around\n1060. A garden house on the Nile in Fustat was let in 1137 for 8\ndinars and half of another garden house cost 300 dirhems per year\nin 1229, which also represents a yearly rent of approximately 8\ndinars.® A similar sum can be calculated as the rent for an apart-\nment from a lawsuit submitted to Maimonides.*\n\nMore opulent merchants would occupy premises costing a dinar\nor more per month. The India trader whose purchases of houses\nhave been mentioned above, rented for himself a ground floor\nconsisting of two ga‘as and costing 1 1/6 dinars per month, although\nhe himself was traveling all the time, and another India trader leased\nhis house in Barqa, Libya, for two years for 40 dinars, which is\napproximately the same.” Nahray b. Nissim, as we have seen, was\nprepared to pay 1 dinar a month for the part of a house which he\nsought to occupy in addition to the share belonging to him, and in\none account he actually paid 30 dinars for two and a half years rent.”\nThe rent for a ground floor of a large house in Alexandria cost 40\ndirhems per month in 1194, which corresponds at least to a dinar.”\nRents of 5—11 dinars per month, as recorded for Cairo by the\nPersian traveler Nasir-i-Khosraw, have not yet been traced in the\nGeniza records. The Persian perhaps was accompanied by several\nwives and concubines and a retinue of servants, wherefore he\nneeded premises of a type never dreamt of by persons in more\nmodest circumstances.” Even an amir (military commander or\nnobleman) paid only 34 1/2 dirhems per month for a qa‘a he occu-\npied, according to a Geniza document.”\n\nThe foregoing seems to indicate that the amounts of the rents\nremained remarkably steady during the eleventh through the\nthirteenth centuries, although we are able to observe actual or at-\ntempted raises in the payments of individual occupants. One case\nwhere we have two contracts relating to the same property, but\nseparated by an interval of forty-four years, is particularly instruc-\ntive. In 1076, a man who already possessed one-quarter of the\ncompound in question (consisting of a large and a small house)\nrented the remaining three-quarters for 4 1/2 dinars. In 1120, half\nthe property was let to the husband of the sister of the proprietress;\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The payment in 1120 was 7 qirits per month,\nthat is, 84 girats or 3 1/2 dinars for half the property per year, which\nwould equal 5 1/4 for three-quarters. The difference of 3/4 dinars\nin the amounts of the rent is fully accounted for by the fact that the\nlower sum was an advance payment for the entire year. Again we see\nthat a rent of 6—7 dinars per year for a whole residence was com-\nmonplace among middle-class people.”\n\nThe ratio between the value of a house and the rent paid for it can\nbe established with certainty only with regard to properties where\nthe relevant data are available in full. A house in Fustat was sold in\n1102 for 500 dinars and brought a total of 30 dinars rent per year,\nwhich included taxes paid by the tenants. Half a house in Alexan-\ndria cost 60 dinars in 1103, and the rent for that half was 3 dinars.\nThus, the yearly rent was 6 percent of the price of the house in the\nfirst case and 5 percent in the second.” That ratio might indeed be\ninferred from our findings regarding the prices of house and the\namounts of rents in general. The reason for the relatively low rents\nmost probably rests in the availability of living space, whereas the\nrelatively higher cost of houses might have had its cause in the cost of\nrepairs and in the limited opportunities of investment, for which\nurban property was one of the most avidly coveted objects.\n\nIncome from houses, that is, rent, was one of the most common\nconstituents of the dowry given to a bride. Various documents show\nus how this arrangement worked in practice. In a betrothal agree-\nment, a daughter receives the uppermost floor of a house; if she\npreferred to live elsewhere, she would receive the rent, but her\nfather and his heirs were responsible for the payment of the ground\nrent and the watchmen.” In another document, a woman is given\nthe rent from a middle floor with the proviso that if the place\nremained vacant, it was her loss.” The fragment of a marriage\ncontract from Alexandria contains the condition that if one of two\nsisters sharing a house chose to live in another place, she could rent\nher share only to her sister.”\n\nSuch restrictions are natural and common. In a letter, a tenant is\nwarned not to sublet a part of the premises leased to him, especially\nnot to Jews, who made too much use of stoves and of the kitchen\nwhich would ruin the house. In a strongly worded note a young man\nis ordered to vacate the apartment let to his father and to remove his\nbelongings by noon, for the place was let to his father, not to him.** A\ncontract for the lease of a qa‘a for two years stipulates that the lessee\nwas not permitted to install anything for the production of rose\n\nGoitein, S.

The communal House of the Glassmaker housed between ten\nand fifteen tenants at different times. One hundred and fifty years\nearlier, ten people were found in another house belonging to the\ncommunity.*® There is no reason to assume that apartment houses\nbelonging to private persons were less populated. When a Muslim\nrented a house comprising seven habitations with the right to sublet\nit, and paid only half a dinar rent per month, we may assume that the\nspace occupied by the subtenants was rather limited.®* Yet over-\ncrowding was regarded as an offense and liable to give rise to a\nlawsuit. A legal question submitted to Maimonides deals with this\nproblem. Two sisters sold the ground floor of their house, which\nrepresented two-thirds of the property, while they lived with their\nhusbands and their children on the upper floors. The buyer lived in\nthat house for eighteen years and married off his daughters and\nsons, purchasing for them living quarters elsewhere. After his\ndeath, the widow let her children with their families live with her, so\nthat they could derive income from the apartments given to them by\ntheir late father. Instead of one couple, about fifteen persons now\noccupied the ground floor, causing damage to the lavatories (in the\nplural!), the water supply, and the building in general, “which had\nbecome like a caravanserai.” The two sisters requested that the\nwidow be ordered to turn out her sons and daughters and their\nfamilies. Maimonides rejected the claim for the purely formal\nreason that the inhabitants of the ground floor did not trespass on\nthe premises of the upper floors. On the opposite side, if the number\nof the occupants of the upper floors had considerably increased, it\nwould have been judged an offense. The master’s decision proves\nperhaps that such occurrences were not very frequent and did not\nrepresent a general nuisance, in which case he perhaps would have\nadopted a more pragmatic attitude. Living space was plentiful in\nFustat. As a rule, only the quarters of the poor were crowded.®\n\nDurability and maintenance.—Mosques, but no palaces or houses,\nhave survived from the period studied in these pages.

This house had been in existence for at least eighty\nyears, but most probably for many more, before it served as part of a\ndowry.* Communal records refer to certain properties during\nperiods over a hundred years and, naturally, such places had been\nowned by the families of the donors for a long time before they were\ngiven away. The testimony of the pious foundations about the\nduration of houses owned by them is indeed most impressive, al-\nthough it is not always unequivocal.*®\n\nThe history of a house is recorded in the documents describing\nthe transactions related to it. Since the Geniza is not an archive, it has\nnot preserved a complete dossier of deeds, but describes one that\nwas submitted to a rabbinical court, no doubt, in a lawsuit. The\noriginal proprietor of the house concerned was the amir Iftikhar\nal-Dawla (Pride of the Realm) Mubarak (Blessed, a personal name)\nal-Afdal (The most Noble) al-Juydshi (i.e., belonging to the retinue\nof the viceroy of Egypt Badr al-Jamili, Amir al-Juydsh, Com-\nmander of the Armies, 1074—1094). Iftikhar sold a part of his house\nto a gisszs, or Christian clergyman, of the Melkite denomination, and\nanother part was given, or willed, by him to his daughter Sarwat\n(Cypress).* The clergyman sold his share to another Melkite Chris-\ntian, who gave or left it to his daughter Banina (Little Girl). The two\ngirls, the daughter of the amir and that of the Christian, sold their\nshares, amounting to the entire house, to a Jewish notable, known\nalso from another document as The Illustrious Persian Head Physi-\ncian, who acquired them for himself and his wife Sitt A‘daha (Mis-\ntress over her Enemies).” There was an additional transacticn\n(recorded in a Hebrew document), namely, between the two\nspouses, through which the wife became the owner of the entire\nproperty.

The front was\nconverted into an 7wan facing the living room. It required a complete\nremodeling of the upper apartments, since the iWwar is an open hall\nup to three stories high; consequently, the upper part of the house\nfacing the street was, at the time of the sale, in repair.

It was more\nprofitable to sell it, even as a ruin, than to repair it in order to lease it\nto others. Furthermore, the climate of Lower Egypt, where precipi-\ntation is rare, does not require much protection against rain. If,\nhowever, the damage done by one or two strong downpours is not\nimmediately repaired, decay quickly sets in. Finally, superstition\nmight have been responsible for many a ruin. Houses were looked\nupon as omens. When something inauspicious such as an untimely\nor unnatural death happened in a house, it was considered as being\nhaunted and ill-omened, mayshiim, and was abandoned. Such occur-\nrences, known from Islamic sources, are rare in Geniza docu-\nments.'\"”\n\nTrying now to form some idea about the cost of maintenance, we\nfind that even an old house was supposed to bring substantial reve-\nnue over and above the cost of its upkeep. Dedicating a house for the\nillumination of the two synagogues of Fustat, the donor stipulated\nthat the upkeep of the property had precedence over the intrinsic\npurpose for which the gift was made.'*® We should not attribute too\nmuch importance to a statement in a question submitted to Maimo-\nnides, according to which most of the rent of an apartment occupied\nduring the thirty years was spent on repairs. For it was reported that\nthe tenant, the brother of the proprietor, purposely damaged the\nplace to force the latter to cede it to him.'* In a document from July\n1150, a perfumer undertakes the renovation of a ground floor and a\nloggia for 40 dinars in return for which he was entitled to occupy\nthose localities for eight years, which presupposes a rent of 5 dinars\nper year. The house belonged to “Wuhsha’s daughter’s daughter”\nand was situated in the Zuwayla quarter of Cairo in the Street of the\nSlavs, saqaliba. A tabaqa, an apartment or part of an upper floor,\n“the one adjacent to the house of the Christians,” in a Jewish com-\nmunal building was restored for a cost of 30 dinars, while, at the time\nof the writing of the report, the ground floor beneath it was com-\npletely occupied, bringing revenue.''® A rent of 3/4 dinars per\nmonth or 9 per year was waived for 16 months against structural\nchanges or repairs carried out in a building belonging to a pious\nfoundation according tc an agreement made in 1156.\"** A tenant in\na house worth 500 dinars spent the equivalent of ten months’ renton\nsupports costing 280 dirhems with the subsequent approval of the\nproprietor, who had been abroad during the period.\"?\n\nRecords of more expensive repairs are found throughout.

The construction of ceilings\nwas achieved by covering the crossbeams with palm sticks or reeds,\non which flock (waste cotton) and dried bushes were fastened with\nnails and then overlaid with planks and plaster.” Since Egypt is a\ncountry where timber is scarce, the rich development of carved\nwoodwork probably was due to foreign influence.

In view of the possibilities, only a comprehensive\nexamination of all the Geniza trousseau lists is apt to supply a reliable\nand detailed picture of the interior of a house.\n\nHere, however, we incur certain difficulties, partly discussed in\nMed. Soc., 111, 126~128. Under certain circumstances, the objects\nbrought in by the wife had to be returned to her at the termination of\nthe marriage. Consequently, they had to be of durable material. It\nexcluded, for instance, china and other pottery, glass vessels, and\nmats, all of which were commonly used in daily life but occur only\nrarely in trousseau lists. Another difficulty inherent in this source of\ninformation, namely, the inflation of prices in honor of bride and\ngroom and their families, is less formidable than it might appear.\nMany marriage contracts state expressly that the prices are real, “a\ndinar is worth a dinar”; it enables us to check the prices in other\ndocuments lacking that remark or written in places and times where\nit was customary to enter into the contract double or other multipte\nof the actual value.\n\nAll the prices listed in marriage contracts are approximate for\nthey are mostly given in full dinars, which means in round sums, as\ncompared with business correspondence, where, in accounts of\nhundreds of dinars, fractions of one twenty-fourth, one seventy-\nsecond, and even smaller are noted.

Much of that material has gone into the section “The Main\nIndustries,” Med. Soc., I, 99— 116. The reader may use that section to\ncomplement what follows.\n\nThe discussion of domestic architecture has shown that, unlike\nthe majlis, the sitting, that is, living room or reception hall, the other\nrooms of the house are described in the Geniza documents accord-\ning to their size and situation in the buildings or to the specific\nmaterials of which they were constructed, but not with regard to\ntheir function (such as dining room, bedroom, study, office). De-\npending on the seasons of the year and other circumstances, they\ncould serve different purposes at different times and occasions.\nConsequently, in trying to describe the objects usually found in a\nhouse, one may succeed in identifying the functions they fulfilled,\nbut, with obvious exceptions (majlis and kitchen), not be able to\npinpoint their exact location.\n\nThe very process of identification is fraught with difficulties, and\nonly the vastness of the Geniza material enables us to check and\nrecheck a term until its meaning is established with certainty. The\ncasual reader who takes a certain word to mean one thing may find\non closer examination that it designates different objects; one term\nmay reveal itself as having several meanings.

The functions\nfulfilled by these pieces of furniture in our world were satisfied in\nthose days and regions in other ways. By the Middle Ages the\nMediterranean area had become scarce of good wood but was re-\nnowned for its manufacture of textiles. When the martaba, a kind of\nsofa, literally meaning step, was item number one in the list of\nfurnishings brought in by a bride, the reference is not to the material\nof which the elevation on which one sat or slept was made (wood,\nwickerwork, bricks, mortar), but to the precious fabrics and their\nfillings with which it was covered and heightened. The furnishings\nspread on the ground were pile carpets or mattresses of varying\nheights. Whoever could afford it, even the poorest of the poor, tried\nto be comfortable while seated or reclining by using heaps of textiles.\n\nThe absence of chairs, tables, and beds should not be taken as an\nindication of a primitive state of material civilization. Everyone\nknows today that the ancient Egyptians possessed these pieces of\nfurniture in the most refined shapes and embellished by costly\nveneers and inlays. The Bible reader is reminded of the “great”\nwoman from the village of Shunem who suggested to her husband\nthe construction of a small roof chamber for the Prophet Elisha, a\nfrequent guest, and to “put there for him a bed, a table, a chair,and a\nlamp” (1T Kings 4:10). Thus, what was regarded as prerequisite even\nfor a casual visitor by a peasant woman in ancient Israel was next to\nabsent from the houses of the thoroughly urbanized people of\nGeniza times. Not only the progressive depletion of the area of fine\ntimber, but also a change in taste must have been responsible for this\ndevelopment. It was not primitiveness, but a different concept of\nwhat was desirable in the look of a home which accounted for the\nabsence of heavy furniture. The spaciousness of the main hall,\ncreated by the builder, was enhanced by its relative emptiness.\n\nThe furnishings that served for nightly rest could be used for\nseating during the day. But the Geniza sources clearly indicate that,\nwherever possible, the two functions were kept apart. Every middle-\nclass bride brought in one or, more frequently, several martabas,\nand at least one firdsh. Martaba means literally a place onto which\none steps up. In numerous documents it is described as consisting of\nseveral pieces (two to six), gita<, which should not be translated as\ncushions, for along with the qita‘ cushions are regularly enumer-\nated. Thus, the martaba consisted of sofa sections on which one sat\nand cushions and bolsters of different makes to enhance comfort. In\nmany cases a misnad or masnad, support, also a piece of textile with a\nfilling, served as a back or otherwise as a prop.!\n\nIn contrast, firash is derived from a root meaning spreading out,\n\nGoitein, S.

As with us,\nseveral terms and types were in use. But since the term most com-\nmonly mentioned in the Geniza was mikhadda, literally, a place on\nwhich to put the cheek (kkadd), the specific idea of sleeping pillow\nwas expressed by the strange but frequent phrase mikhadda lil-khadd,\na cheek-pillow for the cheek, namely, during sleep. Arabic al-\nmikhadda became Spanish almohada in this double sense: consultar con\nla almohada means taking pillow counsel (sleeping on it), but dar la\nalmohada is the ceremonial assignment of a seat of honor to the\nspouse of a Spanish grandee at her first reception by the Queen,\nwhich may be compared with the cushions accommodating the\nguests in an Arab living room.

The majlis was made of\nTabari, a sumptuous heavy silk shot with gold threads originally\nmanufactured in Tabaristan in northern Iran. It had once been a\nprerogative first of the Sassanian kings of Persia and then of the\ncaliphal court of Baghdad, but later became popular all over the\nworld, from India to the Muslim West and was imitated every-\nwhere.* The majlis was an expensive furnishing; a new one is listed\nat 80 dinars, and another, consisting of two parts of imported and\ntwo others of locally manufactured Tabari, was evaluated at 50\ndinars. The majlis, like the martaba, occasionally had a support or\nback.?\n\nPeople in modest circumstances had to be content with a matrah.\nThis word, from which are derived English mattress and its Italian,\nFrench, and German equivalents, had a checkered history. In\nmodern Arabic it has the general meaning of place, locality, seat (in\na theater), but in classical Arabic it designated a furnishing similar to\nthe martaba.® In the Geniza documents it forms part of the bedding\n(see below), but as its prices and use show, it must have been a\nmattress of good size and height so that in households with limited\nmeans it could replace the martaba.

In the classical\ndictionaries it is described as “a square firdsh on which one sits,” but\nthe object referred to in the Geniza documents had to be oblong,\nsince, like the martaba, it could consist of several sections (three to\nfive).® Since the materials of which it was made were often the same\nas those of the martaba, but the prices far lower, it must have been\nshorter and flatter; it is often listed together with other items of\nbedding and, in better-off houses, probably served mainly as a bed,\nwhereas poorer people had to use it also as a sofa. I translate tarriha\nas daybed.\n\nReturning to the main piece of furnishing of the living room, the\nmartaba, it is noteworthy that at least three martabas or their substi-\ntutes (maijlis, tarraha) were brought in by middle-class brides, one\npiece outstripping all the others in quality and price. For instance,\nAbraham, the Son of the Scholar, a merchant banker, serving later\nalso as judge, received at his marriage in January 1050 a martaba of\nByzantine brocade, worth 30 dinars, and two others of Tabaristan\nsilk, each worth half that price. Mildh, the Fairest of the Fair, an\nupper middle-class bride, brought in at her marriage in November\n1059 a similar combination, the brocade martaba costing 40 dinars\nand the two local Tabaris 10 each.® About a hundred years later, in\nOctober 1155, a lower middle-class bride had a martaba of Byzan-\ntine brocade worth 14 dinars, another of Dabiqi linen worth 5, and a\nthird one of imitation Tabari silk worth 3 dinars.!'® In between,\naround 1100, in a trousseau list mostly providing the prices of\ngroups, not of the individual articles, the sitting facilities are headed\nagain by a martaba of Byzantine brocade consisting of five parts,\nfollowed by two genuine Tabaristans, and one green Tabari manu-\nfactured in Ramle (Palestine).* Even a poor bride had three mar-\ntabas, worth 5, 3, and 2 dinars, the first having four sections.'? Prices\nof 40, 50, and even 60 dinars for the showpiece of the house, the\nmain martaba, mostly made of (Byzantine) brocade, were not un-\ncommon. A brocade martaba was the prerogative of a high govern-\nment official.**\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why such arrangements were\nmade.

It had to\nbe long, for unexpected VIPs had to be accommodated there. Most\nlikely it was also higher than the other martabas, for the marked\ndifferences in price prove that much more material went into it.\n\nConcerning the divans placed on the side walls, two contrasting\ntastes seem to have existed side by side. In the documents of 1050,\n1059, and ca. 1100 discussed above, and others, “two Tabaristans”\nare noted. A well-to-do Karaite bride, married in the fall of 1117,\nbrought in a five-piece Tabaristan costing 40 dinars together with\ntwo tarrahas valued together at 15 dinars. A similar distribution, a\nfive-piece brocade martaba valued at 20 dinars with two Tabari\nmatrahs costing a total of 5 dinars, appear in a lower middle-class\nketubba of 1125, and one martaba for 40 dinars and two tarrahas,\neach worth 15 dinars, are recorded in summer 1156.\" The arrange-\nment of the main divan flanked by two counter pieces corresponds\nto the predilection for pairs and the sense of symmetry characteristic\nof a taste revealed by Islamic art. The same applies to other furnish-\nings of the home, as is noted subsequently. In the list of 1155 and\noften elsewhere, however, each of the martabas is made of different\nmaterial, such as Byzantine brocade, Iranian silk, or its imitations, or\nEgyptian linen, or others, and, wherever noted, also of widely differ-\ning colors. Individual taste or specific circumstances must have been\nat work in these matters rather than a marked development in the\nstyle of the interior, for the relevant Geniza data of the eleventh and\ntwelfth centuries, that is, the Fatimid and early Ayyubid periods, in\ngeneral display a remarkable degree of continuity and uniformity.\n\nA complete change occurred in the thirteenth century, especially\nthe beginning of the Mamluk period, its second part. The wife no\nlonger provided the living room equipment, and her contribution\neven for the bedding proper was so scanty as to be symbolic. This\nchange was not confined to the poorer sections of the population but\nis discernible also in the trousseau lists of well-to-do brides.'® The\nrising, but still modest, importance of the economic role of the wife\nin the Late Middle Ages, discussed in Med. Soc., 111, 132—135, was\nhardly responsible for this development. A change of attitude must\nhave occurred. Sometime in the course of the thirteenth century it\nmust have become customary for the husband to have the obligation\nto provide sitting and sleeping facilities, the main furnishings of a\nhome. But this change, in the main, lies outside the classical Geniza\nperiod.\n\nNext to the divans and sofas, and perhaps even more so, it was the\ncolorful cushions and bolsters that enlivened the interior of a home.\n\nGoitein, S.

Many came with a martaba or its alternative, that is, they were\nincluded in the price of the main price and probably were of the\nsame fabric and color. For instance, a bride brings in “a blue Dabiqt\nmartaba with its cushions and a pomegranate-colored martaba with\nits cushions,”” another “a Tabaristin daybed, tarriha, with its\ncushions, costing 10 dinars,”*® a third, “a silken martaba with its\nsupport [back] and cushions, worth 10 dinars,”** a fourth, “a borax-\ncolored martaba with its cushions,”® and so forth. In these instances\nand in numerous others like them the number of cushions is not\nspecified. An ancient Karaite marriage contract states expressly\nwhen martabas are not accompanied by cushions. Conversely, a\nhusband’s receipt of the outfit of his wife lists a martaba with the\ncushion(s) especially made for it.*!\n\nMost of the cushions are listed separately, though, and are usually\ndescribed by color, material, or specific embellishment. This group\nis discussed next. The “pillows for the cheek,” that is, for sleep, are\ncharacterized as such and are listed with their numbers but without\nany further details.\n\nI have always been puzzled by the prominence of cushions in the\noutfits of a bride. They were, of course, an intrinsic part of the\nseating and sleeping facilities, but their full function was revealed to\nme when I came upon a passage in Abu ’I-Qasim’s Hikdya, a delight-\nful eleventh-century satire on the society of the time. He writes that\na house full of cushions looks like a ground covered with flowers.\nOne type of cushion in the Geniza is indeed called “garden pillow.”\nThe ardent desire for color of a population living in a mostly\ngray-brown landscape could find easiest satisfaction in the interior\nof a home through numerous pieces of furnishings of limited size\nbut most diversified looks. Compare with this the look of a modern\nliving room as presented in the Architectural Digest: The International\nMagazine for Fine Interior Design, September 1978. The photo shows\na large window, and, beneath it, a mighty sofa consisting of three\nsections, and covered with six sizable cushions, all in the same dis-\ncreet and subdued pale beige. As the accompanying article explains,\nthe empbhasis is on the panorama, on the outside. The proliferation\nof cushions in modern living rooms is described in the same article as\ninfluenced by Near Eastern taste.**\n\nAbu '1-Qasim’s Hikdya enlightens us also on another aspect of\nthose ubiquitous objects. I had always assumed that the relevant\nitems noted in trousseau lists referred to the pillow cases. When one\nreads, however, in an ancient marriage contract describing the exhi-\n\nGoitein, S. D.

One does not need two crates for storing\nfifteen silk pillow slips.?® Details in the Hikaya prove that the type of\nfilling could contribute much to the value of a pillow.**\n\nWherever colors are noted—and there is a fantastic range of\nthem—each piece, without exception, has only one color.? It seems\nstrange, for they loved to wear contrasting colors, and the same\ntendency is discernible in hangings. Of course, many cushions are\nembellished: borders, probably of different material, noted espe-\ncially for cushions of Egyptian linen, whether of the Dabiqi or the\nTinnisi type;* badges with inscriptions;* ornamental stripes;*®\nfringes or tassels;*® pieces in different colors (on fine Tinnisi linen),\nif my translation of the frequent term mulawwan is correct;*® gold\nthreads or gilded borders (on pomegranate-colored Tinnisi);* fig-\nures of birds.

The Geniza people had hangings decorated with\nlions, but preferred to sleep on pillows with birds, probably doves.)*\n\nYet it is hard to believe that the cushions, so carefully noted in the\ntrousseau lists together with their prices, were all pieces of one color.\nThese lists were legal documenits; the clerks intended not to describe\nthe objects but to identify them; for this purpose it was sufficient to\nnote the dominant color and, if necessary, also the material and an\nadditional embellishment. For the same reason the trousseau lists do\nnot indicate the shape. Quadrangular, oblong pieces probably were\nthe norm. Round and long cushions are mentioned in a letter\nbecause the writer was specifically interested in them. This letter\nand other Geniza papers defining cushions as round were written\naround 1200 and slightly later.* The miswara, mentioned in earlier\ndocuments alongside mikhadda, the regular term, and the “sup-\nport” (for the back), probably was of that description; it is also found\nin an Arabic literary source.** The idiosyncrasies of clerks writing\nthe marriage contracts were no doubt responsible for another puz-\nzle, namely, that important trousseau lists, especially of the eleventh\ncentury, never identify cushions by color.”\n\nBedsteads, sarir, as the Geniza clearly shows, must still have been\nwidely used during the tenth century, but they went out of fashion in\nthe course of the eleventh.

In an early Karaite ketubba a sarir cost\n10 dinars, in another, together with two chests, the same price, and\nin a similar document from Yemen even less.*” But a bedstead inlaid\nwith ivory (as was customary in ancient Egypt, Israel, and Rome) and\nequipped with a mattress of Tinnisi linen cost 50 dinars, approxi-\nmately one-tenth the value of the entire dowry presented to a bride\nin 1059. Another bedstead inlaid with ivory heads the list of sleeping\nfurnishings in a ketubba of 1039.** When a copyist (one of the\nworst-paid occupations) possessed a Byzantine bedstead, it is likely\nthat it was a heirloom, he brought from his native country.* I do not\nremember having seen a bedstead listed in a document from the last\nthird of the eleventh century or later.\n\nA “tripartite sleeping bench,” dakka (or dikka), worth 10 dinars is\nnoted in a fragmentary trousseau list. Since dakka also designates a\ncupboard for keeping the kitchen copper or a druggist’s containers,\nthree chests of equal size over which a mattress was laid must be\nintended here.*® The bedding outfit of a rich bride is headed by a\ndakka of teak, a precious Indian timber (used also as building\nmaterial), accompanied by two mattresses of “triple-thread” (see\nn. 44) and two others of Sicilian material}—a common combina-\ntion—and cost, together with two items lost, 100 dinars.*!

By far the majority of matrahs were\nmade of locally manufactured Tabari, the popular fabric.*® Its stan-\ndard price, mostly including two pillows, fluctuated between 4 and 5\ndinars. But a modest matrah with its pillows could be had for 1\ndinar, as could a firash of similar quality.** A white Dabiqi matrah\nwith two blue pillows was priced at 12 dinars, but was probably worth\nonly half that amount.* Since in carefully executed marriage con-\ntracts brides brought in both a matrah and a firash, in which cases\nthe former was more costly than the latter, the two words should not\nbe taken as different terms for the same object. The different\nmaterials also tell a story: I have not yet come across a firash made of\nTabari, nor 2 matrah made of Sicilian silk. There is little doubt that\nthese furnishing differed also in shape.®\n\nThe tarraha, or daybed, came somewhere between the martaba\nsofa and the matrah mattress. Like the latter, it if often noted\ntogether with sleeping equipment, but like the former it could\nconsist of several sections and was mostly made of precious fabrics,\ngenuine Tabaristin and brocades of different provenance leading\nthe list. Fine reeds and leather were also among the materials of\nwhich a tarraha was made and might have been used for it exclu-\nsively. Since the tarraha is listed with the other types of seating and\nbedding, martaba, matrah, and firash, it must have had a distinctive\nappearance differentiating it from them.*\n\nOver the bed mattress was laid a pad, called bardaa, mostly made\nof ‘Tabarf; in well-to-do households the barda‘a could be of brocade\nor fine linen.

In the middle of the twelfth century a new material,\nexclusively connected with the lihaf, makes its appearance. It was\nnamed Saqlabi, Slav, probably after an official in charge of the\ncaliphal wardrobe. (“Basil” served in this capacity in 1141, see Med.\nSoc., 1, 147.) Slav slaves were the confidants of the Fatimid caliphs.\nThe general who conquered Egypt for them was a Slav. Naming a\ntextile after a caliph or a high official was not unusual. What is\ninteresting is that the Saqlabi was used, as far as I can see, solely for\nthe lihaf, another indication of the special significance of this\nfurnishing.*®\n\nFour types of nightly covers that served as outer garments during\nthe day are discussed in subsection B, below. Here it is necessary to\nemphasize that in many trousseau lists each of these pieces of cloth-\ning is described as “for sleep.” I take it to mean, then, that the rida,\ncoat, muld’a, cloak, mathafa, wrap, or izar, mantle had the form of the\ngarment worn during the day but was destined to serve exclusively\nas cover during the night. When any of these four garments is listed\nunder bedding, and not under clothing, it stands to reason that it\nserved nightly rest, even where it is not labeled “for sleep.” In many\nGreek, Roman, and medieval illustrations persons appear lying on\ntheir beds in clothing identical with or similar to that worn on the\nstreet. It means not necessarily that they did not change but that the\nnight cover was not, or not much, different in make from regular\nclothing. One contribution of the Geniza papers to the history of\nwearing apparel is beyond doubt: of those medieval people whoever\nhad the means changed for the night. A poor scholar from Jeru-\nsalem complains: “My cover for night, day, and Sabbath is all the\nsame.” It was normal for the three to be different.*”\n\nOne high-priced item of sleeping equipment frequently noted in\nthe Geniza eluded me for a long time: the muzarra, the buttoned one,\nknown from literary sources as a bag held together by clamps\nfastened to buttons (buttonholes had not yet been invented).*® Only\nwhen I encountered this passage in a legal declaration of a mother,\n“the sleeping equipment of my daughter consists of a muzarra, a\npad, a mattress, and two cushions,” did it become clear beyond\ndoubt that this precious article represented a kind of dressing gown,\nwhich was used also as a cover for nightly rest.* Should it designate a\nsleeping bag?

        "text": "ix, A, 4 Furnishings of the Home 117\n\nfrom the Genzia scene (it is found in the prayer book of the German\nemperor Henry 11, before 1014), where a man sleeps on a mattress,\nentirely enveloped in what seems to be a bag covering his head and\nfastened with a clamp.®® In Europe that cover might have repre-\nsented a garment with a hood worn also in the daytime; in the Geniza\nit is always listed with bedding, and as made of brocade or heavy silk\nfabric. It served perhaps as cover during winter. In Egypt the Geniza\npeople often complain about cold, never about heat.*!\n\nThe bedding outfit was completed by an awning, called killa, as in\nAramaic and Hebrew before. The word has the double meaning of\nmosquito net and canopy. Mosquito nets were in common use in\npre-Islamic and Islamic times and the word has retained this mean-\ning up to the present day in both Arabic and Hebrew.** The killa as\ndecorative canopy, however, as common as it was in the outfits of\nwell-to-do brides during the eleventh century, completely disap-\npears from the trousseau lists of the twelfth. In the two cases in\nwhich I noted a similar furnishing, one from the year 1143 and\nanother from approximately the same time (at “the rich bride”), two\ndifferent terms were used, which shows that the decorative canopy\nhad become entirely exceptional. Like the pre-Islamic bedstead the\ncanopy had gone out of fashion.*®®\n\nThe canopy was mostly made of sharb, or fine linen, emerald and\nother shades of green being the preferred colors, followed by white,\nsky blue, pomegranate, blue, yellow, and red. In three cases a sharb\ncanopy cost 50 dinars. In one of them, it is described as being plain,\nwithout patterns, musmat, from which one may conclude that the\nkilla cloth was normally decorated with geometrical, floral, or other\ndesigns.®* Canopies were repeatedly imported to Egypt from Tuni-\nsia, among them a blue one described as gabisiyya, manufactured in\nGabes.” One wonders whether Tunisia, which was more tho-\nroughly romanized than Egypt, retained that Roman luxury longer\nthan the country of the Nile. However, in the trousseau list of a\nJewish bride from Palermo, Sicily, from the year 1479 (still written in\nArabic), a canopy headed the list. The editor remarks that every\nSicilian bride of that time got one. In this matter, East and West had\nparted company.*\n\nDraperies, carpets, mats, and hides.—Sofas and cushions imparted to\nthe interior of a house its characteristic appearance. So did curtains\nand hangings.\n\nCurtains, sutir (sing. sitr, literally, cover), formed so profuse and\ncostly an item in the outfits even of middle-class brides that one\nwonders what purposes they served.

The windows were protected from\nthe sun and the eyes of neighbors or riders on the street by screens\nmade of cheap wood or similar light material. Window curtains,\nespecially when made of the heavy goods mentioned in the Geniza\nfor curtains, would have been utterly impractical. They would have\nrobbed the rooms of ventilation, so vital in a hot country.\n\nDescriptions of houses, preserved in the Geniza and translated\nabove, pp. 7981, always emphasized it when a room had a door\nand specified the type. We may therefore conclude that many rooms\ndid not have doors. Only when the main room of an apartment\nlacked this equipment is it expressly stated.®’ It is safe to assume,\nthen, that curtains often replaced doors, serving as portieres. They\nwere common among the Greeks and Romans, as proved by such\narchaeological evidence as the many bronze rings for curtains found\nduring the excavations at the Agora of Athens and other sites, as\nwell as by frequent references in literature (“they have curtains at\nthe entries to their bedchambers”), and reliefs portraying that\nusage.®®\n\nIllustrations in Arabic books provide similar information. As\ndescribed above, the majlis, or main room of a house, often opened\ninto two accessory rooms.*® One painting shows such openings cov-\nered with two pairs of curtains. Another painting shows only one\ncurtain on each entrance, each matching the other.”\n\nThe recesses in walls which served as cupboards or bookcases are\nlisted sometimes as having doors and sometimes as having none.™\nRoman bookcases were protected by doors, but occasionally also by a\ncurtain.” The Holy Ark containing the Tora scrolls was covered\nwith a single green curtain in the Synagogue of the Iragians in 1080,\nand with a pair of curtains in that of the Palestinians in 1075.™ That\nceremonial object had a specific function, comparable with the cur-\ntain at the entrance to the Holiest of the Holy in the Temple of\nJerusalem and later in front of the altar in Byzantine and Coptic\nchurches.\n\nThe late Veronika Gervers, in “An Early Christian Curtain in the\nRoyal Ontario Museum,” discussed in detail the function and his-\ntorical development of curtains in early medieval synagogues and\nchurches, as well as in Muslim palaces.™\n\nI do not remember seeing an Arab illustration of a bookcase with\na curtain but suspect they had some.

The Geniza has preserved such\nan inscription, executed in huge Hebrew letters, certainly destined\nto be engraved in wood—if not to be embroidered on a curtain.™\n\nCurtains fulfilled a great variety of other functions in the medi-\neval Mediterranean—Near Eastern home. We cover our walls with\ndurable paperhangings, they decorated them with carpetlike tex-\ntiles, which could be exchanged from time to time, especially on\nfestive occasions. Moreover, curtains were hung up across a room to\nbe used as a divider for privacy, or, when not needed for this\npurpose, to be pulled up to leave the room as spacious as its measure-\nments permitted. When entering the large reception hall or living\nroom, one faced a curtain. The master of the house and his com-\npany were seated behind the curtain against the wall farthest from\nthe entrance door. Then the curtain was drawn, and the scene was\nready for a petition to be submitted to a governor, a case to be\nbrought before a cadi, or simply a reception, followed by a festive\nmeal. The illustrators of Arabic books have left us pictures of such\nscenes, always carefully depicting the curtain, either pulled up to the\nceiling and knotted, or drawn aside and floating in the draft caused\nby cross ventilation. In the house of Maimonides the usher was\ntermed “keeper of the curtain.”””\n\nArabic literature is replete with stories about the use of curtains as\ndecoration, perhaps the most famous being the description of the\nreception of a Byzantine embassy at the caliphal court of Baghdad in\n917. The palace was bedecked with 38,000 curtains and wall covers,\nsome ornamented with the figures of horses, elephants, and lions,\nothers with gorgeous Arabic script; still others were imported from\nChina, Armenia, or Egypt; and the rest were old pieces taken from\nthe storehouses of the caliph’s six predecessors. The number was\nprobably exaggerated, but the many details furnished by the nar-\nrators, on this and other occasions, drive home the decisive role of\nthe curtain for interior decoration.”™\n\nAgainst this background the data of the Geniza become meaning-\nful. Curtains appear in the trousseau lists mostly in pairs, but often\nalso as single pieces (expressly designated as such: fard), and, where\ndetails are supplied, the latter are more costly and longer than the\nformer. In a list from the year 1028 a bride had a pair made of\nMaghrebi brocade costing 20 dinars, a single one of Dabiqi linen\nwith Tustari bands worth 15 dinars, and two pairs of Bahnasi make\ntotaling 25 dinars.”™ Around 1075 or so Nahray b.

Soc., 1, 456). Al-Bahnasa was renowned for its textile\nindustry, which was not confined to the manufacture of linen cloth.\nIn the exceptional instance that I have found in the Geniza in which\na Bahnasi is defined by its material, it was made of wool.* (The\nIslamic Museum of Cairo possesses a multicolored piece of wool\nshowing a human head surrounded by little hares [not: hairs!] and\nbearing the inscription: Al-Bahnasa.*®) One bride had two pairs of\nBahnasi, each six cubits long and ornamented with figures of lions.*”\nAl-Bahnasa was famous for its tapestry.

The popular Bahnasi could be had for 5\ndinars per pair and less. Woolen curtains were rare.”\n\nIn Karaite documents brides bring in single curtains made of\ncostly materials named after two cities in souther Iraq, Wasit and\nQurqub. The rich Karaites were mostly immigrants from Iran and\nIraq. No wonder that they cherished fabrics known to them from\ntheir native countries which were used to adorn the palaces of the\ncaliphs. “Kingly” curtains, Khusrawani (from Khusraw, the Arabic\nname for the kings of Persia), adorned the houses of wealthy people.\n1 do not believe that the term simply means sumptuous, for, if it did,\nit would not have been used in a long list specifying the types of gifts\npresented to a Byzantine emperor nor would it have been men-\ntioned in a Geniza marriage contract along with other curtains made\nof siglaton and Bahnasi.

With regard to the religious scenes once\nfilling the walls of the Romanesque churches of the West, a compe-\ntent observer has aptly remarked that they formed part of the very\narchitecture of the building by conveying its function to the spec-\ntator. In the Geniza, other than some reference to animal figures, no\ndetails are provided concerning the illustrative elements of wall\nhangings. As known from contemporary Islamic tapestry pre-\nserved, the figures must have been purely decorative, satisfying the\ncraving for beauty and, one should perhaps add, sumptuousness,\nbut not for religious indoctrination.®®\n\nSince draperies served largely as interior decoration of a home, it\nis not surprising to find that people tried to borrow some for special\noccasions. The note translated below betrays in its humorous vein,\nenhanced by highfalutin Hebrew phrases (italicized), the mood of\nthe revelry for which the draperies were requested.\n\n“All those who know my lady, the righteous and most excellent dowager, and take\nrefuge under the shadow of her wings say that she lends out hangings or curtains,\nin so far as they are available and easy to spare, so that people can decorate\ntheir homes with them. May I ask you kindly to grant me this favor? If,\nhowever, for any reason you cannot do it this time, please let me know. And\nPeace. May the well being of your excellency increase steadily.\n\nIf the elder Abu’l-Mahisin—may his Creator preserve him—has arrived, let\nhim show me his face. And Peace.”\n\nThe postscript is an invitation to a relative of the “dowager.”® One\nmay wonder why the bride was supposed to supply the draperies.\nThe reason, I assume, is that the curtains were originally part of the\nbedding outfit. They were to serve as dividers of a room shared by\nhusband and wife in common, providing privacy for her. This\nexplains why wealthy brides and others rich in bedding furnishings\noften bring in only one pair of curtains.*” In a carefully written list\nfrom the provincial town of Malij, a poor bride has besides the four\ntraditional pillows only a pair of curtains “for the arch,” meaning\nhung up as a divider (and not as a wall cover). It obviously was\nregarded as a basic necessity. But, as often happens, the original\ncustom of the bride bringing in curtains for the purpose of privacy\nwas expanded in the course of time to include all their other uses.*®\nThe Geniza has preserved placards in superb Hebrew script of\nlarge size containing verses from the Bible.

But Jews did not participate in the wholesale trade of\nthis commodity, which was probably monopolized by merchants\nfrom nations that manufactured carpets, such as Persians or Ar-\nmenians. No Jewish anmat?, or carpet dealer, has turned up thus\nfar.'** The largest quantity of carpets ordered in a Geniza letter seen\nby me was six pairs.'* Jewish craftsmen occasionally entered into a\npartnership for work in the Carpet House of Fustat, and a Jewish\nkatib, or government official, who must have been well-to-do, was\nemployed there.'*® But dealings in carpets were definitely a sideline,\nand a very minor one at that. Yet the spare information on the\nsubject contained in the Geniza is not without interest.\n\nThere was no absolute dividing line between carpets, bedding,\nand hangings. When a poor bride who married in Tyre, Lebanon, in\n1054, had a cover, a carpet (funfusa), and seven Tabari pillows,\nworth a total of 3 1/2 dinars, the tunfusa served as her bedding.'** A\nfurnishing with the same name and certainly serving the same\npurposeis listed as worth 1 dinar in the marriage contract of another\npoor woman from the same century.'® The terms probably de-\nscribed a pile carpet of small dimensions, as borne out by repeated\nreferences in Arabic literature to one person sitting on a tunfusa, or\nby a Geniza story of a wife pilfering one (together with other easily\nmovable objects) from her husband’s house, or by another of a\nwoman giving one to a pawnbroker together with a gold ring against\naloan of only 3 dinars.\"*® When the estate of a coppersmith included\nthree old tunfusas and that of a foreigner, two, described as prayer\ncarpets, it is likely that the pieces concerned were of modest size.'*” A\ntunfusa could serve as a wall hanging.

They did not walk on carpets with their shoes on.'*®\n\nA business letter sent from Aden, South Arabia, to India around\n1140 describes a tunfusa as decorated with the signs of the zodiac\ncircle. The zodiac was a favorite ornament of the mosaic floors of\nByzantine churches and of synagogues contemporary with them,\nand decorates the bottom of a copper basin encrusted with silver\nmade for a ruler of Yemen in 1295. The casual way in which the item\nis mentioned in that letter scems to show that a carpet with a zodiac\nmedallion in its center must not have been extraordinary in those\ndays. '\n\nThe flexibility of terms for what we call carpet reflects the variety\nof uses for the same textile. This is beautifully illustrated by compar-\ning two inventories of the synagogues of the Palestinians and Iraq-\nians in Fustat from the years 1159 and 1201 with two others from the\neleventh century. In the later documents a section is devoted to the\nanmdt, the term from which anmati, carpet dealer, is derived. The\npassage in the 1159 inventory says: “The anmat for the two syna-\ngogues: Three for the Tora scrolls, decorated with gold threads\n‘mixed’ with niello; one smaller one, of the same type, for the scroll\nof the readings from the Prophets; two red ones ‘mixed’ with gold\nthreads; twenty-two namats made of brocade and siglaton; one for\nrotation;''® and nine others, partly old and partly worn-out; a piece\nof cotton woven with cotton, twenty cubits long.”*!*\n\nThe twenty-two namats were the carpets covering the floor of the\nsynagogues, as proved by comparison with an inventory from the\nyear 1075, where mats of different descriptions do the same service\n(see below). The two red namats decorated with gold threads\nformed the hangings on the holy arks in the two synagogues, de-\nscribed as “curtains” in the eleventh-century documents.!'* Finally,\nthe namats for the Tora scrolls (not “worn” by them, as is customary\ntoday, but put over them as a cover when they were taken out of the\nark) were artistically decorated but otherwise of the same material\n(brocade or siglaton) as the floor carpets and were therefore called\nby the same name.\n\nThe inventory from which the translated passage is taken was\nwritten in 1159, when a new beadle took over. We may assume that it\nwas made also because some or many of the possessions of the\nsynagogues had been lost during the terrible period of internecine\nwars and anarchy experienced by Egypt in the 1150s.**> The as-\nsumption is even safer with regard to the list of the anmat found in\nthe two synagogues in October 1201.

Each textile is called\nnamat and is defined by its dominant color (red, three times, orange,\ntwice, wine-colored, yellow, black, and so on) or by its make, ‘attabi,\ntabby, listed five times. Six of the twenty-four pieces were decorated\nwith gold threads or “mixed” (gold and other threads), which means\nthat they served as covers or hangings. Of the namats covering the\nfloor one is described as “made in the House,” namely, the Carpet\nHouse of Fustat, that is, locally manufactured, and not imported as\nmost others, and another as “a physician’s carpet,” namat tabibi.'**\n\nWhat a doctor’s carpet looked like may be inferred from the\nestate of a physician which comprised three large pieces, one “a\nmiddle piece” (see below), white with blue borders, twenty-two\ncubits long, and two others, one of red silk, twenty-seven cubits long,\nand another, a red one, eighteen cubits long. A successful physician\nhad to seat many visitors (as both Maimonides and Judah ha-Levi,\nthe Spanish Hebrew poet, who were physicians, emphasize in their\nletters), and silk was perhaps favored because it could be cleaned\nmore easily than other textiles.'*®\n\nThe description of the distribution of martabas and sutir, the\nseating facilities in the living room, and the hangings on its walls has\nshown that the wall opposite the main entrance took pride of place,\nwhile the side walls were less prestigious.''” Ernst Herzfeld’s recon-\nstruction of the arrangement of carpets in the audience hall of the\nSassanian kings and later the Abbasid caliphs shows a similar pat-\ntern, imitated, as the Geniza finds suggest, in private homes. Under\nor in front of the seat of the ruler a large “front” or middle piece,\nsometimes called sadr, was spread out, bordered on its right and left\nside (as seen from the entrance) by two runners, mostly referred to\nas musalld, prayer carpet. The prayer carpet, as Herzfeld explains,\noriginally showed a long row of praying men, represented by the\narches of the prayer niches. After a reception at the caliph’s court,\nmusallas were cut into pieces, each showing a single prayer niche,\nwhich were distributed to particularly honored guests. A single\npiece became the Muslim prayer carpet, as it is known up to the\npresent day.'*®\n\nPrayer carpets were ordered, and, in one case, even preserved in\nan estate, in pairs, which reflects their role as runners alongside the\nborders of a larger carpet.'*® In both an order and an inventory,\nprayer carpets appear together with runners: “Two fine runners,\n\nGoitein, S.

One wished to cover the\nHoor as completely as possible “from wall to wall”.

Their make should be perfect. He\nshould not leave much of a border. The borders should be as dense as the\nmiddle, approximately one cubit; otherwise their make will not be proper.\nAnd have him work at his leisure. I wish to have them, God willing, for the\nPassover holiday.'**\n\nTo obtain a single piece for a room (and not a pair with extras, as the\nwriter of the passage translated) one had to be particularly explicit: “The\nplace is eleven cubits long, twice as long as the thread attached to this letter,\nplus one cubit, and five cubits wide, less two finger breadths, exactly like the\nlength of this thread, when it is stretched out well. {[These measurements are\nprovided] so that the mat should not be ruffled.”**\n\nAt the end the writer apologizes for troubling the recipient with\nan order for a one-piece mat, which was so much more difficult to\nadjust to a room than a number of pieces.

Lane so scrupulously de-\nscribed their primitive lamps made of glass and wood.***\n\nThree different types of illumination are reflected clearly in our\nsources: lavish, in the synagogues—and, as we know, far more so in\nthe mosques and churches; costly, in the reception hall of a private\nhome, especially when it had to be lit for festive occasions; and by no\nmeans simple for regular household needs. None of the many\nlighting appliances for synagogues noted in Med. Soc., 11, 150, occur\nin the trousseau lists of brides, although there lamps and candle-\nsticks are usually first in the Copper section (which includes bronze\nand brass); illumination of the majlis, or reception hall, was again a\nmatter by itself. In the houses of worship lamps had to be sus-\npended; hence the many bigandalat, or chandeliers, triangles, and\nhoops—all bearing small glass vessels filled with water, oil, and\nwicks—or the grillwork lamps, which did not cast long shadows but\npermitted the light to be dispersed all over the building. In a majlis,\nchandeliers were hung as were the regular household lamps, but its\npride was the wax candles and, in particular, the subl, or bright ones\n(tfrom subh, morning), that is, those of great height and diameter,\nwhich provided much light and could burn for hours. (Anyone\nvisiting a museum with an Islamic collection must be impressed by\nthe enormous candlestands from the Mamluk period, which are\nrarely absent; they are princely pieces and give an idea of the size of\ncandles for great parties.) Beeswax, of which the candles were made,\nwas very expensive, perhaps three times as much as the “good,” that\nis, olive oil, let alone the linseed and other less valuable oils, which\nwere commonly used. Only a very rich man could permit himself to\nlight thirty subhiand over two hundred regular wax candles. In the\nsynagogues, throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries, no wax\ncandles were used.’®®\n\nWe are comparatively well informed about household lighting\nbecause the wife was expected to provide the necessary appliances,\nat least for the more intimate rooms of a home. Whoever could\nafford it brought two “lamps” into the marriage, one described as\n“brides’ lamp” and the other as “wax candles lamp,” the former\nusually of a higher value than the latter. Only in one marriage\ncontract (with realistic prices) was the wax candles lamp worth 10\ndinars and the other only 6, and they were among the higher\namounts noted for lighting implements brought in by a bride.'*® For\nall those lamps were of “copper,” none of silver.

The wife’s\ncontribution probably was destined mainly for her personal do-\nmain—her sitting room, bedroom, and the kitchen. Itis noteworthy,\nhowever, that even poor brides brought in at least one, and often\nmore than one, lighting appliance made of copper.\n\nSince the “brides’ lamp” is listed with, but different from, “the one\nwith wax candles,” we shall not be amiss in assuming that it was\nlighted with oil. It was perhaps not much different from the wed-\nding lamp drawn by E. W. Lane around 1835: a wooden device\nrepresenting a six-pointed star (known today as Star of David, but\npreviously named Solomon’s Seal, not a Jewish emblem, but a magic\nsign, bringing good luck), from which were suspended one large\nand several small oil lamps.’*® Perhaps the “brides’ lamp” of the\nGeniza had no fixed shape but was simply an oil lamp given and\nkindled at the wedding.\n\nAll examples given in note 196 of a brides’ lamp noted together\nwith a candles chandelier are from the twelfth century. In earlier\ndocuments it was called a “trousseau lamp,” in one case called so\neven on the occasion of a divorce settlement, when some articles of\nthe outfit had been sold by the husband and others had been lost.'*®\nIn the thirteenth century the trousseau lists note a bride’s “jug\nlamp,” that is, a lamp in the form of a jug and made of decorative\ngrillwork in bronze. Lamps of this type have been painstakingly\ndescribed and profusedly illustrated by D. Storm Rice, the most\nancient known one having the Solomon’s Seal as its central decora-\ntion.**® An exceptionally well-equipped thirteenth-century bride\nhad two “Damascene lamps,” two candle chandeliers, a small lamp,\nand a jug lamp, the latter, worth 3 dinars, being the most valuable of\nher six lighting appliances.** In other documents jug lamps cost 2,\n8, and 10 dinars, respectively.?”® Unfortunately, no descriptions of\nthe two Damascene and two Spanish lamps are given. The jug lamps\nwere no doubt suspended from the ceiling. Other oil lamps in a\nprivate home were movable, and they were probably in the majority.\nHere is an order for one, sent from Aden to the west coast of India,\nwhich was renowned for its bronze industry:\n\nMake me a nice lamp from the rest of all the copper (sufr).

We\nfind one in a trousseau list, and in the estate of a scribe even a “joint”\nlamp made of wood. The “head,” that is, the part containing two or\nmore cavities for the oil and wicks, should be movable, up, to illumi-\nnate the room, down, for reading. Others preferred the head to be\nfixed to the body of the lamp.***\n\nSome trousseau lists note lamps “with their appurtenances.”\nOther lists specify what they are. Scissors were needed for trimming\nthe wicks. A light was extinguished by a snuffer; blowing it out was\nunpleasant and regarded as ominous, for light is a symbol of the\nsoul, and “Man’s soul is a lamp lit by God” (Proverbs 20:27); as often\ntoday, the snuffer had the form of an inverted funnel; it is men-\ntioned twice as being made of silver. Finally, a lamp had its tray on\nwhich it was put to avoid smudging its environment.**®\n\nIn addition to oil lamps and chandeliers for wax candles many\nbrides had one, two, or three candlesticks or prickets, hasaka, liter-\nally, thorn, all made of “copper.” Despite the modest name, a bronze\nhasaka could be quite expensive. In an inventory from the year 1028\ntwo were evaluated at 10 dinars. A rich bride had “a large candle-\nstick”; but even “a small one,” ordered in India, was supposed to\nweigh three pounds and to be constructed “in steps.” This one is\nexpressly described as “for a candle”; a letter accompanying a con-\nsignment of Lebanese copperware speaks of a hasaka for wax can-\ndles, in the plural ?*®\n\n“Two candlesticks” were not more frequent in the copper section\nof the trousseau lists than, say, two buckets or two ewers.

But the word could also designate the\n“head,” or upper parts of an oil lamp, which comprised several cups\ncontaining oil and wicks, and even that of “a wax candle lamp.”*®\n\nThe silver lamp suspended on silver chains before the Holy Ark\nin the synagogue (and on the corresponding holy spots in churches\nand mosques) is always called gindil (derived from Latin candela as is\nour candle), a word still common in Arabic but not used in the Geniza\nfor a lighting appliance in the house.?*\n\nThe standard of four lighting appliances brought by the bride—\noil lamp, chandelier, candlestick, and portable small oil light—taken\ntogether with the assumption that the illumination of the living\nroom or rooms was normally incumbent on the husband, induces us\nto imagine that, in Geniza times, a middle-class home was fairly well\nlit and did not look as “dull” as the interior of an Egyptian house\nwhen E. W. Lane saw it.*\"* The long entrance corridor, dihliz, how-\never, seems not to have been regularly lit. In a report about an\nassassination attempt the writer mentions that he did not recognize\nthe assailant because he went into the dark dihiiz without carrying a\nlight. The same assumption underlies the humorous story from the\nArabian Nights of the Jewish physician who ran down the staircase\ninto the unlit corridor and fell over his patient, believing he had\nkilled him.*'* When leaving the house at nighttime one certainly\ncarried a lantern, probably called misbah. For the time being, I have\nonly one reference to this term from the Geniza. Whether it was\nmade partly of glass, as occurs in the famous Verse of the Light in the\nKoran (24:35), 1 cannot yet say. It is worthwhile, however, to\nremember that in a house without windowpanes, where strong\ndrafts were common, a “hermit’s lantern” must have been quite\npractical even for use in the interior, especially in the kitchen.*'?\n\nFor igniting lamps one kept in the house a box containing flint\nstones, valuable enough to be noted in an inventory. Sulphur\nmatches must have been common, for a householder would ask a\nneighbor in an adjacent apartment for one as we would ask for a\nsafety match.**®\n\nHeating appliances were probably a regular feature in the outfit\nof a bride from Damascus and other more northerly places. She\nwould have one or two kanans, best translated perhaps as firepot\nbrazier, or coal pan. But occasionally Cairo could be cold. When a\nphysician, describing his excessive mourning over the death of a\nyounger brother, writes, “I did not leave a single stove or brazier in\nthe house from which I did not take ashes, putting them on my\nhead,” his home must have been well equipped with those utensils.?**\n\nGoitein, S.

Aromatic woods were burned on them to deodorize a\nroom after a meal. This custom, entirely unknown in our own\nsociety (if we disregard the homely aroma of cigars), had its roots in\nremote antiquity. Burning incense in the temple was the most pre-\ncious and most holy of offerings; it concluded and topped the\nanimal sacrifices in the houses of Ged, just as it followed a meal in the\nhomes of men. The Church, in using its thurible, has preserved this\nceremonial; the Synagogue had to forego it, because igniting fire\nwas prohibited on a holy day. But as soon as the Sabbath was over,\none lit the brazier, equipped it with odoriferous woods, and said the\nbenediction over the mugmar, or burning aromatics. Later, one dis-\npensed with the brazier and said the benediction over fresh or dried\nfragrant plants.\n\nThe mijmara, brazier or censer (derived, as the reader sees, from\nthe same Semitic root), congruous with its noble function, was always\nmade of silver. The silver classification in the trousseau lists did not\ninclude bronze inlaid with silver; the Geniza had a special term for\nthat. Bronze incense burners from the Fatimid and Ayyubid peri-\nods, mostly in the form of animals, real or imaginary, may still be\nadmired in our museums. Silver censers were rare. It is possible that\nthose brought in by Jewish brides were especially destined for the\nrite at the termination of the Sabbath. Their aroma was intended\nnot so much to be diffused in the room, as to be snuffed by the\nindividual worshiper to enable him to pronounce the appropriate\nbenediction.*®\n\nThe fumigator, mibkhara (from bukhdr, fume), appears in one\ndocument right after the mijmara and must therefore have been\ndifferent from it in form and possibly function. The mibkhara was\nmade of bronze, which seems to have been the rule, or of bronze\ninlaid with silver, or, in one case, of silver. It seems to have been the\ncommon utensil for deodorizing a room at the conclusion of a festive\nmeal when the guests were still present and the party was going\nOn'ﬂlﬁ\n\nA third type of incense burner, called midkhana (from dukhan,\nsmoke), presents problems.

Inexpensive midkhanas were\nmade of bronze. There was, however, one of ebony wood decorated\nwith silver, and, even more puzzling, quite a number of others\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Only\na limited number of brides had in their outfit the braziers needed for\nthat type of deodorizing.*'® Freshening appliances, that is, vessels\nwith fragrant woods, whose pleasing scent was supposed to over-\ncome bad odors wafting in the house or intruding from the street,\nwere in general use, however, and appear regularly at the end of\ntrousseau lists.

I assume that many\nwere earthenware vases, but, like other easily perishable materials,\nwere not included in brides’ outfits. Bardni are usually, but not\nalways, defined as mutayyab, scented with ¢, which in Arabic is the\ngeneral word for perfume, but in the Middle Ages designated an\nIndian odoriferous wood of the aloe family. As explained in the\nnote, an inexpensive variety of aloes must have been the main\nscenting material. The widespread use of these freshening devices\nseems to prove that they met a vital need.

In those days when houses were not equipped with running\nwater, a basin with a ewer was an indispensable piece of equipment\nin every home, and two or more such pairs were desirable. Anyone\npresent, a servant, a wife, a child, would pour water from a ewer on\nthe hands of a person who wanted to wash, so as to waste as little of\nthe precious liquid as possible. Moreover, the washed hand would\nnot be defiled by seizing the handle of the ewer touched before by\nthe hand that had not yet been abluted. A case in point is the story of\nbeautiful Cassia, who rushed from her bed to serve her father at\nwashing as soon as she perceived that he was readying himself for\nnightly prayer.!\n\nBasin and ewer are often listed together in Geniza marriage\ncontracts, and one may assume that in those cases they matched each\nother, particularly as in a thirteenth-century document that says “a\nDamascus basin with its ewer” (costing 5 dinars, whereas a Fustat pair,\npossessed by the same bride, was worth only 2 dinars). An Andalu-\nsian basin costing 8 (real) dinars was accompanied by “a large ewer”\nworth 3 dinars in 1156. A matching pair, and one of superb crafts-\nmanship, created by a thirteenth-century metalworker from Mosul,\nIraq, has actually been preserved.”\n\nWell-off brides had two basins and two ewers.* People preferred\nto have one large and one smaller basin, the former especially\nneeded when guests came to dinner. In the twelfth century it be-\ncame fashionable to describe the larger one as caliphate-like, mean-\ning huge and of top quality.* A thirteenth-century basin is labeled\n“pre-Islamic,” that is, very old, “antique,” and cost 12 dinars, an\nexorbitant price, seen by me only once more in a document from the\nyear 1186. A basin with a pair of “ears,” that is, handles, was among\nhousehold goods received by a widow from the estate of her hus-\nband in 1128. Medieval basins preserved are rarely equipped with\nhandles. When a list of copper vessels contains not a ewer but “a\ncopper sparrow,” one is inclined to believe that it refers to a small\newer decorated with or having the form of a bird.’\n\nFor washing the face and other parts of the body one had one, or\npreferably, two or more washbasins, named maghsal, made of cop-\nper, and also, I am sure, of earthenware, although our sources had\nno reason to make mention of the latter. One copper maghsal was\ngiven as a pawn for a loan of 2 dinars, but two used ones were\nevaluated as being worth only half a dinar.® Washbasins made of\nsilver must not have been uncommon.

Together with many other fixtures and utensils it was\ngiven to a widow in payment of the late installment of her marriage\ngift.®\n\nWater for washing and cleaning was drawn from a well, appar-\nently found in every house. A bucket and a dipper, both made of\ncopper, formed as common a pair in trousseau lists as a basin and a\newer. A pair could be had for 1 dinar; but a well-off widow, who had\ntwo buckets and two dippers, evaluated them as being worth\n15 dinars.® The bucket, sat! (from Latin situla), appears in different\nshapes: round or quadrangular, small, middle, or large, and is\nrepeatedly described as “with legs,” which was a blessing for the\nhousewife, inasmuch as she did not have to bend over every time she\nhad to scoop water.'® Copper and brass buckets were imported from\nDamascus and other places in Syria, from Baghdad, and even India,\nbut, as far as our documents tell us, the imported ones were not\nmore expensive than those locally produced. An India bucket cost\n1-1/2 dinars, and a Damascene or Syrian one even less (same price\ntogether with a lamp). In one marriage contract (ca. 1125) a Dama-\nscene bucket is described as “ornamented with coins.”\"!\n\nThe word translated as dipper, karnib (from Greek khernips),\nbasically means gourd, but, as in Europe, the dry shell of this fruit\nserved as a vessel and gave its name to a utensil made of metal similar\nto it in shape. When we find in a list of used household goods “a small\nkarnib without a handle” we are led to assume that a handle was\nnormally affixed to the karnib mentioned with the bucket. This\nsmall improvement over nature was not only practical, but possibly\nhad a ritual purpose, especially when one had to make a prescribed\nablution without another person doing the pouring.'*\n\nSoap was an important article of import from Tunisia to Egypt,\nand sometimes the government confiscated all the consignments for\nits own needs. In the households represented in the Geniza, soap\nwas used for washing clothes, not the body.** Instead, ushnan, pul-\nverized ashes of alkaloid plants, served the purpose.

When, in addition to the regular utensil, a bride had two silver\nushnanas, or a government official three, we understand that guests\nhad to be honored not only by beautiful washbasins and ewers, but\nalso by matching ushnan containers. An Arab literary source de-\nscribing “the ushnan of the kings and great personages” emphasizes\nthe care to be taken with this material. “It must not be touched by any\nhand except that of the person performing the ablution.”**\n\nFor bathing one visited a bathhouse, normally once a week.

The intake of food was much\nmore limited than ours and far less variegated. Moreover, bringing\nhome cooked food from the bazaar was common practice. Although\none document states that Jews did more cooking at home than\nothers, we see that brides have in their trousseaus a meal carrier, a\ncontrivance consisting of several compartments and a handle in\nwhich various warm dishes could be brought home at a time. The\naverage cost of such a brass porte-manger, as the French call it, was\n2 dinars. It was used throughout the Geniza times.'* The Cairene\nmuseum of Islamic art possesses a complete porte-manger, of\ncourse, for princely use.'® Pairs (not two) of these utensils appear\nboth in marriage contracts and in inventories. It seems to prove that\nthe pair was to be carried by a person, one in each hand, and not to\nserve the Jewish practice of dividing the kitchen into a meat and\ndairy section.

Only once have I come across a\nhand mill listed in a trousseau list, namely, in that of a very poor\nwidow who perhaps could not afford to pay for the grinding; she\nremarried shortly after the death of her husband (probably forced\nto do so by dire need).'® One or more hand mills are listed in\ninventories, but they were trade tools, not kitchenware.** By con-\ntrast, mortar and pestle were common items in a bride’s outfit; their\nuse was multifarious; two mortars, “one large, one small,” were by\nno means a luxury. Even a pestle alone would be listed in an inven-\ntory as something valuable.?!\n\nThe dough for the bread was prepared in the house.

Good bread needs\nintense heat, which is costly to produce in a kitchen and, in a hot\ncountry, unpleasant.*\n.

Every bride had an oil cruse. I\npurposely use this biblical word (I Kings 17:14), because that small\nvessel performed a special service and probably had some symbolic\nconnotation as well.

This utensil was not a container in\nwhich the oil was kept, but a small jug, probably with a spout,\nconstantly in the hand of the housewife when she moved around the\nhouse filling lamps, or when she stood in the kitchen cooking, frying,\nor preparing sweetmeats. It seemed to symbolize the wife’s role as\nprovider of food and light.**\n\nI do not enumerate the usual kitchen implements that occasion-\nally appear in the Geniza documents, but a few deserve special\nmention. The zanjala (or zinjila), tentatively translated by me as\ncanister, or as spice box, is as ubiquitous in trousseau lists and\ninventories as it is absent from Arabic dictionaries. It must have\nbeen a common utensil, since a lane in Fustat, named after its\nmanufacturers, is mentioned in at least two Geniza documents and\nin the writings of Muslim antiquarians.?® Neither can its function be\nin doubt, when a court record lists “a small zanjala with its lid and\nanother larger one, without lid,” and the inventory of an estate notes\n“a small brass zanjala and another made of brass, at the pigeons,”\nmeaning, outside the house, containing food for the beloved pi-\ngeons kept by many.* A bride had “six lids and zanjalas” (in this\nsequence!) costing 6 dinars, another, one, from the small town of\nMalij, had three, a third bride, two; but all the many others, as far as I\ncan see, had only one. Since so many types of containers are men-\ntioned in our documents, this indicates that the zanjala had a special\nform and function, but I do not know what they were. It was perhaps\na small container for salt, pepper, cinnamon, and other spices, and\nin the majority of cases, when only one was brought in by a bride, it\nwas destined to serve as a salt shaker. Bread and salt were insepa-\nrable. While breaking the bread and pronouncing the benediction,\none sprinkled it with “the salt of the covenant with God” (Leviticus\n2:13).%\n\nIt is worthy of note that pieces of regular kitchenware, such as\npots, kettles, and caldrons, were rarely brought in by brides, and if\nthey were, more often than not, they came in pairs, even frying\npans.* The latter had both a Greek and an Arabic name, were made\neither of iron or of “stone,” and were of two types, one for roasting\nnuts and seeds, and the other for regular kitchen use.® The kitchen\nwas crammed with glass bottles, clay vessels, and metal containers.\nThe countless orders to grocers preserved prove that although one\ncarefully stocked the house with grain for a prolonged period, all the\n“accompaniments of bread” were bought in very small quantities—a\nfew pounds, a pound, or less.

Throughout the centuries the\nmuttagimi, called so after the Abbasid caliph al-Mu‘tasim (ruled\n833 —842), was used. Fortunately we have a description of this object\nby Maimonides, written in, or shortly before, 1168: “This is a large\nboard of wood into which many small compartments are carved,\neach containing a different dish.” An affluent Karaite bride from\nthe early eleventh century had one, but the only price I have found\nthus far for one was 1-1/4 dinars (ca. 1140). A man bought two for\nhis father, and two were found in the estate of a scribe, a duplication\nhardly made for ritual reasons (meat and dairy dishes). An inven-\ntory from (143 notes a “caliphate-like,” that is, large, muctasimi,\nwhich was cracked, as often happened with wooden utensils. Except\nfor the description by Maimonides I have not yet come upon this\nutensil anywhere outside the Geniza.**\n\nAnother service tray, the sadr, on which were put the bowls and\ncups to be used at a meal, was made of copper or brass, cost between\n1 and 2 dinars, and was found in the homes of the poor and the rich.\nIn trousseau lists and inventories of any kind only one is noted.*\nThe khainja (Persian, little table), which served a similar purpose and\ncost about the same, must have been different from the sadr, since\nthe two appear separately in one document.

A\nletter from Alexandria orders from Cairo fifty zabdiyyas “with\ndecorations in color” (as against only ten platters of the same de-\nscription).

In a tenth-\ncentury marriage contract it cost 15 dinars.” A father, on his death-\nbed, left his silver cup to his son, while the jewelry was to be divided\nbetween his daughters.” Two silver cups sent from Egypt to the\nMaghreb around 1100 weighed 200 dirhems, that is, 625 grams, or\n312.5 grams each. This detail is included in a statement under oath\nin which the merchant who had carried those cups together with\nmany other pieces of merchandise confirmed having received them.\nThus the weight noted must have been exact.™\n\nThe gadah tumbler was made of china or glass.” Earthenware\ngoblets, saghar, with gold luster were ordered in Fustat.” The gikf,\ndespite its name (skull), must have been a shallow drinking vessel of\nsmall dimensions, since it is mostly listed as being of silver, and the\nhighest price for it noted thus far is 4 dinars. It was among the\nsilverware exported from Fustat to India. An amber qihf with a\ngolden rim or ornamental design probably was a toilet article.”\n\nSpoons, forks, and knives were not used at the table. At least we\ndo not read about them in connection with other tableware. In\nArabic one “drinks” the soup. For eating, a piece of their soft bread\nwas a perfect means for seizing a morsel of food and conveying it\nsafely to the mouth. Meat was cut in the kitchen. Chicken and other\nfowl, when placed upon the table whole, could be dissected with the\nfingers. Our dishes of vegetables stuffed with small pieces of meat\nand other fillings are relics of the time when one did not use knives at\nthe table. Knives cccur in the Geniza documents, but always in the\nsingular. The knife is described as being of silver, silvered, gilded,\nwith a silver hilt, or keptin a sheath. This was not a ceremonial bread\nknife as in use today; bread was “broken,” or, rather, torn, not cut.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

        "text": "ix,A,b Housewares 149\n\nWhere the prices listed were minimal (1 dinar or less), it must have\nbeen a small utensil for general purposes.”™\n\nFumigating the dining room after an elaborate meal was one of\nthe amenities of life which anyone who could afford it would not\nforgo.® In addition to purifying the air and making one feel com-\nfortable, it was customary to sprinkle those present, and, in partic-\nular, the guests, with rose water. We can hardly imagine today how\nwidespread the use was of water distilled from rose petals in those\ntimes. One enjoyed their fragrance and believed in their compre-\nhensive faculties of enhancing or restoring health. Rose water was\ntraded in large containers, but for household use one had a long-\nnecked brass bottle named qumgum. In a book on traditional life in\nSa‘udi Arabia this term is jokingly explained as a hint. In Arabic qum\nmeans “get up!” The sprinkling of the guests with rose water was a\nsign that the party was over and everyone was advised to go home. In\nGeniza times the qumqum was the bottle in which rose water was\nbought and kept in the house.* The actual sprinkling was done with\nthe “sprinkler,” invariably made of silver and one of the most com-\nmon household utensils made of that precious metal.**\n\nThe ubiquitous flies caused great discomfort, especially during\nmeals. Flyswatters with handles of wood, iron, or silver, and\nequipped with canvas, helped to dispel this nuisance. E. W. Lane in\nhis drawing of a meal in a middle-class household in Cairo around\n1830 depicts two attendants, one serving and the other operating\nthe flyswatter. This picture does not fit the Geniza society. Even\nminiatures almost contemporary with the Geniza showing a slave\nswinging a flyswatter over the head of a governor during an audi-\nence should not be compared with life as it was in Geniza times.\nJewish households did not keep male slaves; as far as slaves were\nkept at all, they were business agents and the like. Female attendants\ncould not be employed at a meal where guests were present. The\nflyswatters were objects for personal use; the fact that silver handles\n(one costing 15 dinars) are mentioned points in the same direction.®\n\nSimilarly, fans were not large canvases constantly operated by\nslaves, as we know from Arabic literature, but small utensils. An\norder from Aden, accompanied by 3 dinars of local issue (worth\nabout 1 Egyptian dinar), is carried out in Fustat thus: “He asked me\nto buy him fans and to frame them. I bought him twenty and had\nthem framed.” (The writer was a well-to-do merchant.)®* When a\nrich Karaite girl in Fustat had four Baghdadi fans in her outfit, they\nwere certainly of high quality (or did she wish to have some for her\nkitchen?).** When arguments grew acrimonious in an assembly of\nnotables one VIP would hit another’s knee with his fan, an occur-\n\nGoitein, S.

Of Abu Sa‘d al-Tustari,\nthe Jewish “vizier,” it was said that he had a roof garden of three\nhundred silver pots with trees; and a small garden within a house\nwas nothing special.®* When referring to a son in a letter to his\nfather, one would usually call him “the lovely flower” (in Hebrew).\nThe Jews of Sand, Yemen, had a lamp consisting of an upper,\nsmaller container for the oil and a wider, hollow and open base.\nWhen not used as a lamp, the vessel was turned upside down and\nserved as a vase for flowers. Whether one of the lamps discussed in\nthe preceding subsection had a similar form and function cannot be\nsaid.

How the Prophet dressed, perfumed himself, and dyed\nhis hair is an extensive subject in the classical biographies of the\nFounder of [slam. Following this example, the vast biographical\nwritings of the Muslims about their rulers, scholars, and holy men\nrarely fail to mention their types of clothing and other aspects of\ntheir personal appearance. Like the intellectuals of Late Antiquity\nthose of early Islam dedicated considerable time of their nightly\nconversations to matters of the wardrobe.\n\nThe boundless riches that fell into the hands of the conquering\nMuslims enabled them to adorn themselves lavishly. Naturally, the\nquestion arose whether such luxury was compatible with a religion\nthat preached otherworldliness, forsaking this world and seeking\nthe face of God in the next. The prevailing answer was in the\naffirmative. “When Allah bestows favors on a man, he wishes them\nto be apparent on him.” This saying, attributed to the Prophet in the\nancient sources, means to say that the display of riches was an\nexpression of gratitude toward God who had provided them.®\n\nCharacteristically, the pietist response to the manifestations of\nworldliness was directed against sumptuous clothing and, connected\nwith them, furnishings. “Sinful luxury, isrdf, is not perpetrated in\neating; it is in furnishings and clothing,” says Ibrahim Adham\n(pronounce ad-ham), one of the founders of the Muslim pietist\nmovement known later as Sufism. The word Sufism is derived from\nsif, wool, then the clothing of the poor.® In the most representative\nIslamic code of the Hanafi school, Abd Hanifa, the founder of the\nschool (d. 767), is credited with having worn a cloak worth 400 gold\npieces; this is adduced in order to emphasize what the law and the\ngeneral consensus of the community permitted.” By contrast, the\nentire apparel of a pious man living in Qayrawin, Tunisia, in the\nninth century, robe, undershirt, pants, and shawl, was worth only\none silver coin.® Both reports probably are legend, which would\nenhance, rather than diminish, their meaningfulness.\n\nThe prophets of ancient Israel thundered against luxury in cloth-\ning, jewelry, and furnishings, so much so that Isaiah 3:16—-24 pre-\nsents to us a full picture of the haughty “daughter of Zion” at her\ndressing table.® But that was in the times of independence, before\n\nGoitein, S.

Covering oneself meant arraying oneself in\na way that showed respect toward one’s fellowmen when one ap-\npeared in public and especially in the most gregarious of all places,\nthe house of worship. There, the eyes of God were also felt to rest on\nthose assembled. The tallith, or so-called prayer mantle or prayer\nshawl, now something to be worn during prayer and the synagogue\nservice, was nothing of the kind in ancient times. The tallith was one\nof several general words designating the upper garment. The Jews\nattached to it fringes or tassels of a certain type as prescribed in the\nBible (Numbers 15:37—41). As in so many other matters, the Yem-\nenites preserved this old custom well into the twentieth century.\nUntil a few decades ago one could see their old men leaving the\nhouse wrapped in a large piece of black cloth to which were fastened\nthe prescribed tassels, reaching almost to the ground. The <ardi\nshawl, which could be used as a prayer mantle in Geniza times, might\nhave looked the same.’® The admonition to make every effort to\ndress oneself and one’s beloved properly clearly distinguishes be-\ntween clothing and cover, just as the bridegroom in the Karaite\nmarriage contract from Jerusalem, 1028, promises to provide his\nfuture wife with clothing “for home and street.”\"\n\nThe relationship between the two is thus defined in a description\n\nGoitein, S.

Life was organized in such a way that one spent a\nlarge part of his time in the open air. It explains in part the role of\nthe upper garment as a status symbol rather than as a means of\nprotection for the body.*\n\nAnother matter was involved. Nakedness was an abomination, so\nmuch so that no case of a naked person, inside or outside a house, is\never reported in the Geniza. The very frequent complaint about\none’s “nakedness” means having no proper clothing.* A respectable\nperson’s robe should conceal his entire body, and the robe itself\nshould be covered almost entirely by the outerwear. By such precau-\ntions the complete opposite of nakedness was obtained: the limbs of\nthe body and its contours were hidden from the eye.* This attitude\ntoward clothing seems to have been more or less common to the\npeoples of the Mediterranean region during the High Middle Ages,\nto which, at least down to approximately 1100, Northern France,\nWestern Germany, and England must also be reckoned to a certain\nextent.

Here is a story from the pinnacle of early\nIslamic society. When the caliph Othmin (644 —656) was seen wear-\ning a silken mutraf worth 800 dinars—an unseemly luxury for a\nMuslim male—he explained: “I ‘covered’ Na'ila [the wife of his old\nage] with it, but seeing me wear it gives her greater pleasure.”®\n\nInstances of garments worn by both husband and wife occur in\nthe Geniza more than once.

The reason, no doubt, was originally the Talmudic saying:\n“Since you cannot honor the Day of Atonement by food and drink,\nhonor it by spotless outerwear.”*® It is possible, however, that prac-\ntices of the Muslim environment were also influential.

These holidays were, as a Talmudic\nopinion had it, “one half for God and one half for yourselves”; they\nshould be divided between study and enjoyment.** Geniza letters\nreferring to clothing on those holidays emphasize their joyous look.\nA cantor whose bundle of clothing was lost when it fell into the Nile,\ncomplains to the Nagid Mevorakh: “I have nothing beautiful with\nwhich to celebrate the feast.”** A jobless scholarly person, writing to\na well-off acquaintance, says: “I need beautifying things for the\nholiday,” alluding discreetly also to a new dress for his wife.** As far\nas dress was concerned, these holidays were even more demanding\nthan Sabbaths, which ranked higher in sanctity. “One of my troubles\nis that my ‘prayer shawl’ for Sabbath is torn; I patched it, but it did\nnot hold. . . . I am embarrassed in view of the forthcoming blessed\nfeast [Heb.].

A woman in al-Mahdiyya,\nTunisia, writes to her brother who was on a business trip to Egypt,\nwhen it was reported that he had fallen ill in the foreign country: “I\nvowed that neither I nor my daughter would eat during daytime,\nchange clothes, or visit a bathhouse.” Fortunately, passengers from\nanother boat soon reported that the traveler had recovered and\nenjoyed good health.”\n\nChanging for the night was common. Certain outer garments,\nsuch as the rida coat, the mul@'a cloak, the malhafa wrap, and the izar\nmantle, are often qualified in the Geniza as lil-nawm, for sleep,\nmeaning that they were similar in appearance to garments worn\nduring the day, but differed from them slightly when used as nightly\ncovers.

By chance, a letter from a\nsmall town contains orders for both a turban and a robe; the writer is\nprepared to pay 5 dinars for the former, but only 3 for the latter.®*\nFrom a shipment of threads (of fine linen) sent from Fustat to\nAlexandria, a turban was made measuring 25 cubits, whereas the\npiece of cloth for a robe to go with it contained only 20.*” For fine\nSicilian turbans—much in demand—one paid 4—6 dinars. Like\nmost other Sicilian textiles, they were made of silk.** But even cotton\nturbans of good quality could cost up to 3 dinars, whereas a man’s\nrobe was to be had for 1—2 dinars. Much material and high quality\nworkmanship went into these fabrics of utmost thinness wound\naround the head.*\n\nThis intense concern for the head cover, as far as I can see, had its\nroots in two entirely different human dispositions: the wish to im-\npress our fellowmen on the one side, and the awe for the divine,\nbefore which we have to humiliate (and perhaps also to protect)\nourselves, on the other. The head is that part of our body on which\nthe eye of persons facing us rests the most; the message we desire to\nconvey by our appearance is affected the most by it. In antiquity\nJewish common men, like Greeks and Romans, usually went bare-\nheaded. The famous passage in I Corinthians 11:1—13, which pre-\nsupposes this fact, so often quoted today because of its antifeminist\nstance, could be illustrated by many Old Testament and Talmudic\nreferences. Nevertheless, persons of special rank: kings, priests, and\nbridegrooms (who played the role of kings), wore turbans of dif-\nferent shapes and names. One of them (a common one) was p'er, a\nword combining the meanings of ornament and pride. It so happens\nin the history of clothing, those who could afford it imitated “the\ngreat.” The prophet Isaiah castigates “the daughters of Zion” for\ntheir luxurious p’érs (3:20), and the noble Judeans, who were exiled\nto Babylonia, wore p’érs like the priest and prophet Ezekiel address-\ning them (24:17-23). By the time of the development of a large\nmiddle class in early Islam every respectable person had to orna-\nment himself with a turban. It had become a status symbol like the\nupper garment.\n\nThe meticulous covering of the head was motivated also by reli-\ngious sentiment. In the Aramaic language, which was spoken every-\nwhere from Babylonia to Palestine for fifteen hundred years until it\nwas replaced by Arabic, bareheaded meant bold-faced, defiant.” But\nwe should not be irreverent in the presence of God, who is constantly\nwith and above us. “I never walk even four cubits bareheaded, for\nGod’s presence is above my head,” says one of the sages of the\nTalmud.

The astounding\npopularity of the upstart silk, which became widespread in the\nMediterranean area in the centuries preceding and following the\ncoming of Islam, is one of the most distinctive expressions of a\nrefined and extravagant urban civilization.

As the phrase “whiter than Dabiqgi garments” indicates, its\nnatural color was white.'** In the about two hundred cases of Dabiqi\nI came across, somewhat less than half do not note a color, which 1\ntake to mean that the fabric was white. Of the colors mentioned,\nabout half were “white,” followed by only a dozen cases of blue, a\nsimilar number of grayish (“cloud-,” “manna” [light]-, “lead-\" col-\nored), while a few other colors occur only once, or at most three\ntimes (green). The average price of a substantial piecc of female\nclothing—those forming part of a dowry—made of Dabiqi, such as a\nrobe, cloak, or mantilla, was 3—6 dinars, a considerable expendi-\nture.

This detail\nfrom a long business order is characteristic: “Five pounds Shawd-\nharT and Qurtubi [Cordova silk], half-and-half; and another five,\ntwo-thirds Qurtubi.”** Cordova was famous for its silk; Shawdhar, a\nplace southeast of Cordova and nearer to Granada, produced\nanother variety. The writer wished to have the two yarns mingled in\ndifferent proportions.'*® The woman from Jerusalem who ordered\nin Fustat five pounds of Shadhiina crimson—if it was to be had in the\nEgyptian capital—was perhaps herself a native of Spain or some\nother country of the western Mediterranean.

It would have been too expensive, and too\nwarm during most of the year.'®\n\nThe story of colors in the Geniza is full of surprises. Because of\nthe passion of medieval people—and not only those of the Mediter-\nranean area'®*—for brilliant and variegated colors, hence a flourish-\ning dyeing industry, there was plenty of opportunity to touch upon\nthese topics on other occasions. In Med.

With the means then at the disposal of the dyers,\nserious efforts had to be made to satisfy the multifarious demands.\nThe cost of the dyeing stuffs, often imported from distant countries,\nfar cxceeded the wages of the craftsmen working with them.

Blue is represented in the Geniza\nalso by a variety of different shades such as sky-color (two types,\n10 + 6), bluish irridescent (6), and turquoise (blue-green, 2).\n\nGreen, the basic color ranking third in the Geniza, is outnum-\nbered by its shades, not all of which may be exactly identified with\nregard to origin, especially the most common one, masanni, a bright\ngreen (14).'™ Pistachio (7) and emerald green (4) occur regularly in\nArabic literature.\n\nFrom the list on p. 174, it may be concluded that yellow was\npractically taboo for female clothing in the Geniza world, a remark-\nable fact, for according to a study by the late Ahmad Amin, yellow\nwas the favorite color for everything in the house in Abbasid Bagh-\ndad, and especially for the attire of beautiful women. It would be\nfarfetched to assume that in the capital of Fatimid Egypt they did\neverything contrary to the modes of living accepted in Abbasid Iraq.\nIn Andalusian Arabic poetry yellow was a symbol of treachery, of\nseparation from the beloved, and of unrequited love, which causes\nthe suitor to languish to death.'® Poetry permeated the life even of\ncomparatively simple people in those days and might well have\ninfluenced popular attitudes concerning such delicate matters as\nfemale dress, which, we remember, was mostly displayed in the\nintimacy of the house. Arabic poetry from Spain, like its Hebrew\ncounterparts, had found its way to Egypt by the eleventh century.\nAnd the poetic symbolism itself probably had its origin in popular\nsuperstitions. As far as the Geniza goes, yellow seems to have been\nmore popular among males.'®!\n\nVarieties of yellow and orange, such as the colors of apricot, bitter\norange, sandalwood, saffron, safflower, and others, are also rare.\nThe yellowish-brown honey color is far less represented than one\nwould expect in view of the richness of their palette in hues of\nbrown. Only the yellowish-white of the wax was much favored (10).\n\nRed fetched only 22 points in the list of basic colors. It was widely\novertaken by the light reddish-brown of the pomegranate (36), the\ncolor of the beloved’s cheek in the biblical Song of Songs. Red, pink,\npurple, and violet seems to have had the widest spectrum of diver-\nsity, from yellowish-bright red to crimson, to the deep red of the\nruby, the purplish-brown of the basil flower, and the brownish-pink\nof the eye of the partridge.’®\n\nThe common word for brown, asmar, described not only the color\nof the human skin but also that of textiles.

Nissim was involved.\n\nUnlike the orders and accounts for ordinary garments, costing\napproximately between 1 and 2 dinars, the correspondence about\nready-made clothing destined for the well-to-do is more specific. In\ntwo letters from the eleventh century, one referring to shipments\nmoving between southern Iran and Egypt, and another, dealing\nwith specialties shipped from Cairo to Tunisia, a single piece of male\nclothing costs from “25 dinars or a little more” to 60 dinars, prices\ncomparable with those of the prime items in the wardrobe of a\nwealthy bride.

Genesis 41:42, Esther 6:8). Such a gift was a\nsign of friendship and even intimacy (I Samuel 18:4, Jonathan and\nDavid). In Geniza times, the bourgeoisie, as in other matters, imi-\ntated the ways of the court.?*® The name of such a gift was khil‘a, a\ndiscarded piece, which then received the general meaning of robe of\nhonor.

It was not only poor people who lacked\nready money.*”* When, at the time of the caliph al-Hikim a Jewish\ncortége was attacked by a Muslim mob, and twenty-three persons\nwere beaten, imprisoned, and robbed of their clothing, the caliph\nsubsequently intervened, the Jews were freed, and all their clothes\n“from a thread to a shoe latchet” (cf. Genesis 14:23) were returned.\nThis spectacular event exemplifies that garments could be more\neasily retrieved than general goods, let alone money.?™\n\nIn times of extreme personal misfortune, such as long illness\nentailing costly medical treatment and unemployment, or commu-\nnal disasters, such as famine, or the breakdown of authority and\ngeneral anarchy, one kept body and soul together by selling or\npawning one’s clothing (and, of course, if necessary, other belong-\nings). The Geniza has numerous examples of these occurrences.*\nIn normal times, too, clothes could serve as cash, for instance, easily\nmarketable robes as a payment of customs dues on a large shipment\nof pepper,*™ or a cloak for buying wheat for the family back\nhome.* For me the most impressive example of the cash value of\nclothing is this detail from the life of the Spanish Hebrew poet\nJudah ha-Levi, revealed in a Geniza letter: when the poet had\nalready boarded the ship which was to take him to the Holy Land, a\nmailman from Spain arrived in Alexandria with a letter from a\nyoung relative announcing that he would soon travel to Egypt. An\nadmirer of the poet brought the letter on board, whereupon ha-Levi\nhanded him a turban with a note to his relative advising him to sell it\nand to finance his travel from Egypt to Palestine with what he got for\nit.?”® Allin all, it is evident that besides serving as a cover, as protec-\ntion against wind and weather, and as a status symbol showing a\nperson’s profession and place in society, clothing was capital that\nshielded its proprietor in time of need.\n\nNothing is more indicative of the economic role of clothing dur-\ning the classical Geniza period than the fact that the dowry, this\nsafeguard of the wife’s economic security, never consisted of money,\nbut comprised objects related to the wife: her jewelry, clothing,\nfurnishings, and housewares. The teen-age bride knew little about\nmoney; it was handled by men. But the value of the things with\nwhich she had grown up in her mother’s household (part of which\nwould follow her into her husband’s house), and, in particular of\nthose especially acquired for her outfit, was well known to her.\n\nGoitein, S.

And the foremost part of a wife’s trousseau was\nher wardrobe.*””\n\nBecause of the durability and cash value of jewelry and the\nproverbial infatuation of the authentic Near Eastern woman with\nthis element of her general appearance (“Can a maiden forget her\njewelry, a bride her adornments,” Jeremiah 2:32), one might expect\nthat this item of the outfit was the highest in value, as it was regularly\nthe first to be listed in the Estimate section. This might well have\nbeen the case in Late Antiquity when the traditional sequence was\nestablished of the four sections of the dowry, the nedunyi—gold,\nclothing, bedding, copper. In Geniza times this was practically never\nthe case. For reasons touched on below, clothing always took pride\nof place. In a marriage contract from Damascus, Syria, dated\n24 March 956, jewelry was estimated as being worth 150 dinars and\nclothing 100. These sections are not itemized, as was general prac-\ntice (also in Damascus), but lumped together in round sums, which is\nall the more suspicious, as the total was 395 dinars.

To appreciate such sums it should be noted that\nin a Karaite betrothal document, written (in eloquent Hebrew,\nof course) around 1030, Japheth b. Abraham b. Sahl marries the\ndaughter of a Karaite Nasi (that is, member of a family tracing its\norigin back to King David), presenting her with 100 dinars at the\nwedding and promising a deferred installment of 200 dinars.

This question is the more pertinent, as the Jewish husband\nundertook in the marriage contract to clothe his wife, an obligation\ntaken very seriously by Jewish law, as laid down in the strongest\nterms in Mishna and Talmud and codified by Moses Maimonides.\nThe husband is obliged to provide his wife with winter and summer\ndresses in accordance with his means; if he is able to clothe her in\nsilk, embroidery, or even in garments woven of gold threads, he is\nforced to do so, “forced” in that he may be sued in court for failure to\ndo his duty. The same applies to everything else apt to make the wife\nattractive, such as colorful headgear, eye cosmetics, or makeup.?*\n\nThe idea “that she should not be unattractive to her husband,”\nwhich Maimonides, following the Talmud, gives as reason for his\nlaw on the wife’s clothing, had deep roots in specific Jewish and\ngeneral Near Eastern realities and notions.

I do not believe that the absence of\njewelry was attributable to economic considerations. One could have\na gold ring for less than 2 dinars, and\"a gold-and-amber necklace for\n4 dinars, sums far smaller than those earmarked for garments by the\ntwo dying women in the wills just discussed.\n\nIn numerous marriage contracts the bride receives, as in App. D,\nDocs.

One would like to know the monetary value of those\nshares to gauge the degree of economic security provided the bride\nby real estate as compared with her outfit, in particular, the clothing.\nHere our sources fail us; nowhere are the data about houses in the\ntrousseaus accompanied by prices.

Clothing represented an average of two-fifths of a\ndowry, which in this case would be about 80 dinars, far more than\nthe real estate. Considering that houses brought income, whereas\nthe objects of the dowry did not, one wonders why the latter were\ngiven so much preference. A look at App. D, Doc. VI, provides the\nanswer. The objects of the dowry, one at a time, could be easily\nturned into money, whereas the transfer of real estate or, indeed,\nany action with it, was a clumsy affair. The sentimental value of\nclothing was an additional and most cogent consideration.**®\n\nFinally, the economic importance of clothing is brought home by\nits prominent place in the family budget. The problem of the stan-\ndards of living, including the price of clothing, is, of course, a very\nvast subject. The estimate that the cost of living for a family in\nmodest circumstances was 2 dinars per month during most of the\nFatimid period, however, seems well established.*®® There was a\nstandard price for a robe, the basic garment, of 1—-1 1/2 dinars, so\nthat providing adequate clothing for husband, wife, and children\ndevoured a high percentage of the family income. Many households\nwere unable to carry this burden. The regular handing out of\ngarments to the poor and to lower communal officials by the Jewish\ncommunity of Fustat illustrates this situation.**® Public aid was\ncqualed, if not surpassed, by deeds of private charity, especially\nbefore the High Holidays, when everyone whose family could af-\nford it got new clothing. With a boat sailing late in summer from\nal-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, to Egypt, a merchant sent his daughter’s used\ngarments to Cairo; they were to be sold and the proceeds sent to\nJerusalem to buy clothes for the orphans there. When donning a\nnew dress on a holiday one desired that everyone should share this\njoy of renewal ®*\n\nCosmopolitan, local, and communal aspects—Leafing through the\npages of this book, through Leiters of Medieval Jewish Traders, or other\npublications based on the documents of the Cairo Geniza, one is\nimpressed by the number of textiles brought from faraway countries\nor places, or at least bearing their names. In many cases the circum-\nstances in which a garment or fabric is mentioned enable us to decide\nwhether the geographical definition is genuine or a mere trade\nname. When clothes named after remote regions of northern or\nsouthern Iran are imported to Egypt from Spain or North Africa, or\nproduced in Ramle, Palestine, it is evident that a type of material, not\nits place of origin, is intended.** When, as often happens, both a\nTabari and a Tabaristin Tabari are listed in a trousseau list, it must\n\nGoitein, S.

For\nexample, when Ibn al-Qasbi, the eminent Rav of Fustat, sends\n(around 1135) “a Baghdiadi cape” as a present to his brother in\nLucena, Spain, a garment manufactured in Baghdad is probably\nmeant.*** The sender (who had to inconvenience a prominent mer-\nchant with the transport) certainly chose something special; Bagh-\ndad was geographically and politically (then as today) very remote\nfrom Egypt, let alone from Spain. On the other hand, as the Geniza\nproves, Baghdad robes, gowns, cloaks, turbans and other pieces of\nclothing were available in the bazaars of Cairo, as is evident from the\nGeniza trousseau lists and other documents.®® Despite these con-\nsiderations we cannot know for sure where that Baghdadi cape was\nmade. Finally there are, of course, other cases in which there is no\ndoubt where a garment bearing a foreign name was produced.\nWhen a merchant returning from Tunisia to Alexandria notices\nthat he had not bought his wife the desired Qayrawanese costume\n(consisting of robe, veil, wimple, and cloak) and asks a busi-\nness friend to send one “with the first caravan leaving,” it is clear\nthat a costume manufactured in Qayrawian is meant. It looked\ndifferent from one made in Cairo, and was, therefore, particularly\ndesirable.**®\n\nAs the examples of the Baghdad cape and the Qayrawan costume\ndemonstrate, it was not only the fabrics but also the very form and\nstyle of garments which became diffused through the Islamic world.\nThere was another area of interterritorial penetration: the Mediter-\nranean, of which we cannot yet say how far north it extended in\nGeniza times. One of the most common pieces of clothing Jewish\nbrides, say, of Damascus or Fustat-Cairo received (from the middle\nof the tenth through the twelfth centuries) was a mandil Rami,\npossibly best translated as “a European mantilla.”**’ Because of its\npopularity it was imitated in Egypt, where we find “a European\nmantilla, made in Tinnis.”**® The Rimiyya, noted four times in\nApp. D, Doc. 111, must have been different from the Rami mantilla,\nsince it is once mentioned together with a wimple as forming part of\na “robe of honor,” and both mantilla and wimple served as decora-\ntive head covers. The Ramiyya might have been a kind of jacket, a\ntype of dress not represented otherwise in the female wardrobe of\nthe Geniza.** A thirteenth-century bride possessed three Rimiyyas,\none blue (like the rich bride of Doc. III), one “peacock,” that is\nmulticolored, and one white, “in the Yemenite fashion.” Thus a\ndress of European style, after having undergone changes in Yemen,\nturned up as a specialty in Egypt.*® The European bathrobe,\n\nGoitein, S.

A look at the Index of Place-Names in\nSerjeant’s Islamic Textiles and at the relevant texts translated there\nbrings this fact home. The Geniza shows us how the attitude perme-\nated the common people and even the lower classes. Nor was this\nattitude specific to or new in Islamic civilization. For thousands of\nyears empires had “taken away the borders of nations” (Isaiah\n10:13), dragged artisans and upper-class people from one corner of\nthe earth to the other, but opened also new avenues for trade and\nexchange of goods. Samuel Krauss’s meaty chapter on clothing in\nhis Talmudische Archiologie (as he himself emphasizes in Vol. I,\npp. 206—207) contains an amazing assortment of outlandish names\nand things. As the Mishna says, during the solemn hours of the Day\nof Atonement the High Priest in the Temple of Jerusalem wore\nprecious fabrics of the finest Egyptian and Indian makes.*? Else-\nwhere [ tried to show that the Jewish seats of learning in Babylonia\ncame into being when the silk route from China went through that\nregion, when there was constant coming and going between Pales-\ntine and the Land of the Two Rivers, and when the leaders of the\nnew learning, the first Amoras, had a hand in the silk trade.®'® Late\nAntiquity and the Early Middle Ages were periods of lively ex-\nchange of material goods throughout the Middle East and beyond.\nIslam, which united most of the regions once separated by the\neternal enmity between the Roman and Persian empires, reinforced\nthis trend. The obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca, which was taken\nvery seriously, was another mighty incentive for international ex-\nchange. For, as the Geniza shows, most travelers were also carriers of\ngoods.\n\nFinally, as a consequence of the intensive population movements\nunder [slam, especially from Iran and Iraq'to the Mediterranean\narea, first as colonizers and later as emigrants and even refugees, the\nnewcomers transmitted the customs and tastes they brought with\nthem to both their own posterity and their new environment. When\nAlmeria, Spain, became renowned for its manufacture of a certain\ntype of female dress named after Jurjin, a country in the very heart\nof Asia, it must be that some families from that remote region\n(perhaps both customers and makers of that dress) had found a new\nhome in that Andalusian port city. The frequent occurrence of\nIranian and Iraqgian terms for fabrics and garments in the docu-\nments of the Cairo Geniza is partly to be explained as the outcome of\nlarge-scale migrations.***\n\nGoitein, S.

When we learn from Cairo Geniza that at least\ntwenty-six different types of Egyptian flax were traded all over the\nMediterranean, we understand that different places and manufac-\nturers preferred different varieties.”® Thus a merchant, writing\nfrom Mazara, a port on the southwestern shores of Sicily, orders a\ncertain type of Egyptian flax, “because it is the fashion, the distinc-\ntive mark, of this place.”*'® A postscript to a letter from Jerusalem\nreports that black and sky-blue silk might be sold there, but not\ncrimson.

It was used in the more\nmundane cities of Palestine, such as Ramle, the administrative capi-\ntal, and Ascalon, the Mediterranean port.®\"” That postscript ex-\nplains perhaps why a woman living in Jerusalem at approximately\n(or exactly) the same time had to order crimson silk from Fustat.\nMost characteristically, she did not simply order crimson silk, but\nsilk from Shadhuna, a place near Sevilla, Spain, which specialized in\nthis variety, as we know from a Muslim source.*® Similarly, in Sicily,\nit was not only the great port cities Palermo and Syracuse which gave\ntheir names to varieties of silk, but also the small inland town\nDemona, famous for its silk and carpets (possibly made of silk like\nChinese ones).*\"®\n\nOur trousseau lists do not lend themselves to a comparative study\nof local fashions, for the majority of them, probably more than\nninety percent, originated in the Egyptian capital.

Clothing, brings home the\nspectacle of an obsession pestering the Muslims almost throughout\ntheir entire history.*** This obsession is itself, of course, a sign of the\nexcessive importance attributed to clothing and the status it confers\nby distinguishing the wearer from people lower in rank. Precisely\nbecause the Muslim was aware of how much his religion had in\ncommon with the older monotheistic religions (a mere reading of his\nholy scripture, the Qu’ran, with its biblical names, stories, and laws,\nreminded him of this connection), he needed this constant affirma-\ntion of Jewish and Christian inferiority to reassure himself of his\nown superiority.\n\nSpecial historical circumstances might have contributed to the\norigin and constant renewal of these discriminatory laws. When the\nconquering Muslims overran the Near East, they at first amounted\nto a very limited percentage of the population. They had to disperse\nover wide tracts of land and were in constant danger of being\nattacked when in small groups. To protect themselves from un-\npleasant surprises, they imposed upon the inhabitants of the coun-\ntries conquered the condition that no one should don the dress or\notherwise have the appearance of an Arab (for instance, how he\ncombed his hair). These ordinances were among the earliest made\nin Islam; they appear in the oldest law books, and thus became part\nand parcel of generally accepted Islamic law. The details changed\nfrom time to time, but the basic concepts remained and were re-\nnewed again and again in varying forms, for they were Islamic, that\nis, God’s, law, and the religious scholars, the guardians of the law,\nfelt themselves called upon to watch over their observance.?*\n\nWhy, then, did these laws so often fall into desuetude? Primarily,\nbecause they were no longer needed. In the course of centuries the\nvictory of Islam in countries over which it ruled became so complete\nthat neither the physical, nor the psychological security of Muslims\nrequired protection. True, the qurianic precept that a Muslim\nshould avoid social contact with unbelievers was very much in force,\nbut Jewry and the various Christian denominations formed groups\nso distinct that their members did not need a badge to be recognized\nas such. There were also times of tolerance, not as a matter of\nprinciple but because secular pursuits weakened the barriers be-\ntween religions. The ordinances were enforced in times of crisis,\nwhen scapegoats were needed, as by the infamous caliph al-Muta-\nwakkil, who introduced the “yellow” badge in 850, a measure re-\nnewed in the Seljuk period two hundred and fifty years later.

Its\nchoice as a distinctive sign for non-Muslims, Christians as well as\nJews, probably had nothing to do with either concept but was made\nbecause of its conspicuousness. Al-Mutawakkil’s decree, by the way,\nuses the term “honey-colored,” whereas the later sources speak\noutright of yellow.**®\n\nDistinctive clothing was not only imposed by an oppressive major-\nity but also preferred—to a certain extent, of course—by belea-\nguered minorities. From the time the prophet Zephaniah (1:8)\nthundered against “all those who don foreign vestments” the guard-\nians of Jewish religion insisted that in his outward appearance a Jew\nshould be distinct from his pagan neighbors. In a situation of\nguarded assimilation, as with our contemporaries, the Jews of Jerba,\nTunisia, this semireligious attitude was seeking ways to satisfy the\ndemands of both conformity and otherness. Udovitch and Valensi,\nin their study on the Jews of Jerba, have discussed this trend and\nillustrated it with interesting examples. One wears the same dress—\nwhether indigenous or European—but puts it on in a slightly differ-\nent way, marking the wearer as Jewish.**® Naturally, the Geniza\ndocuments do not permit us such subtle observations. I am not sure,\nhowever, that the Geniza people tried very hard to make themselves\nrecognizable as Jews. The Jerban Jews of 1980 live in a ghetto; they\nconfine themselves to a certain habitat, to a small number of occupa-\ntions, and to their Hebrew religious culture. The Jews of Fatimid\nEgypt knew neither geographical nor occupational ghettos; and the\nbetter-educated people among them were familiar with Arabic\nscript and had some acquaintance with the literary and scientific\naccomplishments of their environment. A coppersmith possessing a\nbook of poetry written in Arabic script, as in App. D, Doc. VIII,\nbelow, was hardly exceptional.®* That being so, one probably\ndressed like the people of one’s non-Jewish environment.

The very purpose of this reli-\ngious duty implied that the fringes should be fixed on outerwear,\nwhich, in biblical times, and, to a large extent, still in the Geniza\nperiod, consisted of a piece “with corners.” When the India trader\nAbu Zikri Kohen was away on one of his prolonged voyages, his son\nSulaymin wrote to him at the end of a long letter: “Please have made\nfor me an “ardi, six and a half [cubits] broad and six, or less [cubits]\nlong [thus!], which might serve me as a tallith [prayer mantle].” A\nfine, stately, white burda, a Yemenite speciality, costing about 2\ndinars, is ordered by Solomon, the son of Elijah, the judge, in Yemen\nwith the request to fix on it the ritual fringes.* The izar, a large\nwrap or coat, is twice mentioned in inventories of synagogue fur-\nnishings—provided with fringes, of course—once “for prayer,” and\nonce “for the Kohanim,” that is, to be donned by a Kohen pronounc-\ning the priestly blessing.**® When a young man from a scholarly\nfamily wrote to his father in Jerusalem, “buy me an Aleppo izar in\nwhich I can pray all the time,” he was probably referring to an\ninexpensive piece of Syrian cotton.**® The shashiya, a long piece of\nfine material, to be used for a turban or as a shawl, also could serve as\na prayer mantle. It was for this purpose, when, in a letter from\nAden, South Arabia, to Cairo a shashiya was ordered embroidered\nwith the name of the wearer and also with biblical quotations. The\nwriter refers to this order twice in his very long missive: “Please buy a\nQurqubi shashiya with gold threads and write on it Abraham b.\nJoseph b. Abraham b. Bundar b.

Maimonides,\nfollowing the opinion of Spanish-Jewish scholars, while coming to\nEgypt, had forbidden the standard Hebrew script to be embroi-\ndered on a tallith. That script was the one engraved by God on the\ntablets given to Moses; it was the holiest of the holy; how could it be\naffixed on the tallith, a simple piece of clothing with no sanctity,\nwhich one was permitted to wear even while entering the toilet? The\ncustom was too popular, however, and too much in conformity with\nthe tirdz of the Muslim environment, to be eradicated at once.\nMaimonides was besought with this question: A person had chosena\ntallith®? for “the fringes” and, since he wished to fulfill God’s com-\nmandments with beauty, he had had the borders embroidered with\nsilk in the finest craftsmanship and on the borders stitched verses\nfrom (Numeri 15:37—41),*** writing the name of God with three\n95.* Warned by the head of the local congregation that this was not\npermissible, he did not heed the warning but persisted in wearing\nthat garment.\n\nIn his answer, Maimonides, although admonishing the com-\nplainant to handle the matter with moderation, goes so far as to\nopine that continuous refusal of that man to obey the law should be\npunished by excommunication. It is indicative of the deep-rooted-\nness of the custom condemned by Maimonides that even after his\ndeath a scholar in Alexandria could ask the Jewish chief justice in\nCairo whether the use of Hebrew standard script was indeed not\npermitted for secular purposes. The chief justice (who happened to\nbe the father-in-law of Moses Maimonides’ only son), quoting the\nmaster’s letter just discussed, reiterated the answer given in it, add-\ning that in Spain (and ini other countries) a type of cursive script had\nbeen invented, so that Hebrew could be used for everything. Span-\nish-Hebrew cursive (as I know it from the Geniza), which imitated\nthe thin and flowing Arabic script, lends itself to embroidery better\nthan the massive and monumental standard Hebrew. I do not know,\nhowever, of any textiles embroidered with Hebrew inscriptions\npreserved from that period. Maimonides’ authority was more influ-\nential than “the endeavor to beautify the fulfillment of God’s\ncommandments.”**\n\nJewish women had fewer opportunities than their menfolk of\nmeeting their Muslim and Christian counterparts.

Since they are described as fass, they must have been\nused as ornaments for rings and not only for chains.**®\n\nBesides those already mentioned I noted, in an account written\naround 1100, 45 beryls, fass bazadz, worth 1 1/4 dinars and, in the\ndraft of a marriage contract from autumn 1157, a neckband of\nlustrous jets, khasr sabaj, intersected with pearls, costing 7 dinars. In\na lawsuit from June 1079 one partner claims from the other “one-\nthird of a balas stone [spelled here balaghsh], weighing 5 1/3 dir-\nhems, and one-third of an emerald ‘tube,” weighing two mithqals.”\nWhy balas should be weighed with dirhems, the weight for silver,\nand emeralds with that for gold escapes me.** In a letter to Aden,\nthe leader of the Jewish community there is advised to send to the\nRayyis, the Head of the Jews of Egypt, among other presents, a\nbeautiful stone of exquisite quality. Precious stones, used for signet\nor regular rings, were the jewelry normally worn by men and appro-\npriate as gifts for dignitaries.**”\n\nThe Arabic term for gem or jewel, jawhar, never appears in\ntrousseau lists and is rarely used in business correspondence. It was\ntoo general. Thus, a merchant in Alexandria acknowledges receipt\nof a bag with jawhar, containing, among other items, ten emeralds\nand eighteen pearls (jumana, never mentioned as a female orna-\nment).*®® Another complains that the year before a customer had\nsent him, against his wish, jawhar which had remained in his store-\nroom and was worn out and yellowed; such a description can refer\n\nGoitein, S.

The jawhari is a dealer in “gems” of all\ndescriptions; the creator of jewelry is a sa’igh.*®\n\nI have dealt with these matters at some length**! because the all\nbut complete absence of precious or semiprecious stones from the\ntrousseau lists of the “classical” Geniza period has baffled me for\nyears. Since trading in such stones was common among Jews, it is\nunthinkable that the ornaments of their women should have lacked\nthose embellishments entirely. I explain this deficiency as a gener-\nally accepted practice of the court clerks who wrote those lists. It was\nnot always easy to define the exact character of a precious or semi-\nprecious stone, and in a legal document, such as a marriage contract,\naccuracy was the most stringent requirement. Hence, general terms\nsuch as wdsita, middle piece, or farida, solitaire, were used, in the\nextremely rare cases when gems were referred to at all; their func-\ntion, not their identity, was stated.*** Mainly, however, it was the\ncomparatively low value of the semiprecious stones which dictated\ntheir exclusion; they were the “fittings” of a piece of jewelry, the\nintrinsic value of which was determined by the gold it contained.*®®\nThe Geniza women did not have really precious stones. Their\n“precious stones” were their pearls.\n\nSecond to pearls in Geniza jewelry, but following close behind,\nwas amber as a basic element, used in combination with gold. Its\norange-yellow color, which is similar to gold, but, because of its\ntranslucency, contrasting so beautifully with it, made them ideal\ncompanions. Add to this the amber’s magic qualities—its producing\nsparks when rubbed and its magnetism “catching straws,” as the\nPersians say, and one understands why it was used for ornaments\nsince early antiquity.*** Yet, I have hardly corme upon it in eleventh-\ncentury trousseau lists or in business letters.*”® Then, from approxi-\nmately 1100, the lists are swamped with amber ornaments, a flood\nthat becomes ever stronger down to Mamluk times. This change was\nprobably a matter of supply. Amber came from the shores of the\nBaltic sea on the northwest edge of the world then known to Mus-\nlims, and probably arrived—or, we should say, arrived again—in\nmass quantity on the southern banks of the Mediterranean only by\nthe late eleventh century.\n\nAmber appears together with gold in various combinations, fore-\nmost as alternating beads in necklaces, shoulder bands, and front-\nlets, and especially in the maymin amulet.

A\npair of hoop pins could cost from 1 to 30 dinars.** Pins are defined\nby such terms as spoons, small trays, compartments, tambourines,\npincers, arrows, clubs (or safety pins?), shepherd’s staffs, and\nothers.*** Pendants are often described as having attachments such\nas boxes, pipes, tubes, cylinders, and the like, and some have been\npreserved.\n\nWhere gold tubes are mentioned independently and not as at-\ntachments to a pendant, hair ornaments might have been in-\ntended.*' When we find small earrings described as cups, we are\ninclined to regard pairs of ornaments named “dervish cups,” and\neven “stirrups,” as earrings too.***\n\nAmong techniques of the jewelers, attention should be paid first\nto the general term sadhaj, plain, repeatedly referred to above. Asin\nclothing, where it meant unpatterned, or of one color only, and the\nlike, in jewelry it had a number of meanings.

It looks as if the theory of the replacement\nof granulation by filigree, expressed decades ago by the author of a\nthree-volume study of the history of goldsmithing, has found addi-\ntional corroboration in the Cairo Geniza.**!\n\nThe bride of 1156 with the filigree siwars adorned with niello\nwork had another pair with niello only, which cost 28 dinars. The\nsame very high price was noted for a pair of niello bracelets in\nDoc. 11, col. 1, 1. 8, dated 1146. And the “rich bride” (Doc. 111, col. I,\n1. 8) had a pair valued at 52 dinars, an exceptionally high sum forany\npiece of jewelry. If filigree was common, niello was prestigious.\nR. A. Higgins defines the material and process of niello in his\nhistory of Greek and Roman jewlery: “a mat black substance, com-\nposed of one or more metallic sulphides, used for the decoration of\ngold, and, more commonly, silver. It is set in recesses cut in the\nsurface of the metal”. He concludes his description with the remark:\n“It was not until the eleventh century A.p. well beyond our period,\nthat a niello suitable for fusion to metal was employed.”**\n\nAs far as the Geniza is concerned, the twelfth century was the\nclassical time for niello work. It was applied almost exclusively to\nobjects made of gold, mostly to bracelets of all types. Only once have\n1 found a silver dabla, a finger ring without a stone, with niello (but\nworth only 2 dinars), and once a silver box and a silver jug with the\nsame decoration.**® The term for niello is mujra, treated, which\nseems to make no sense, and it took me years to identify it. Some\ndocuments mercifully added the word (bi-)sawad, (with) blackness,\nand the mystery was solved. But the very fact that in the great\nmajority of cases in the Geniza, as well as in an Arabic text, mujra is\nused without the addition of (bi-)sawid proves how widely this\ntechnique was applied. Among a tremendous array of costly gifts\nsent by a Byzantine emperor and his entourage to the caliph al-Rad1\nin the year 938, there was a battle-ax with a heavy hilt made of gilded\nsilver, “treated {with black],” and inset with gems.

I\nhave not noted a case of niello later than say, 1180.%%°\n\nThe ornaments.—After this detailed discussion of the materials,\nshapes, and techniques of jewelry, there is no need for a lengthy\ndescription of the individual ornaments. Here, again, we are up\nagainst problems of terminology. When we encounter several terms\nfor a common object, such as earrings or bracelets, we wonder if\ndifferent types are intended, or if the variety of names is only a\nmatter of linguistic usage. A few considerations help to overcome\nthis difficulty, at least in part. When a bride brings in three or four\npairs of bracelets with different names, they must represent dif-\nferent types well known to everyone. But when one trousseau list\nnotes several pairs of earrings, always using the same word, and\nanother list does the same, but with another term, a difference in\ntime, ambiance, or linguistic usage must be assumed, not the shape\nand general appearance of the ornament.**® The place in the list\nwhere a piece is mentioned and its price are also considerations,\nalthough they are indications of only relative value. Thus, in the\nJewelry section, when the first item is an object named ¢isaba, (head)-\nband, costing 80 dinars, and, in the Clothing section also listed first is\nanother object bearing the same name which together with a robe\nand a wimple costs 50 dinars, the place, even where no other details\nare provided (as often happens), defines the character of the picces.\nThe first was made of gold and other high-priced materials. The\nsecond was a textile set with precious ornaments. But matters are\noften not so simple as that.**\n\nThe head is the dominant part of the body and attracts attention\nfirst. From remote antiquity Near Easterners enhanced the domi-\nnance of the head with sumptuous headgear, such as gorgeous\nturbans of the finest linen, or, in the case of women and rulers, with\nextravagant jewelry.**® In those circumstances, 1 translated the\nGeniza ‘isaba as tiara or diadem. Two different types seem to have\nexisted. A golden ‘isiaba of seven pieces with mina sun disks and\nadorned with pearls, costing 50 dinars, another consisting of seven\npieces and described as (made) complete,*® and a third having\neleven parts convey the image of a kind of crown that has one\nprominent center piece with three or five other pieces on each side\n\nGoitein, S.

The hadida clasp, sometimes\ndescribed as large or broad, might have helped to gather up and\nhold the ends of the right sleeve tightly together. This practice\nmight explain the origin of the word; hadid, as a noun, means iron,\nand hadida might be understood as a piece of iron, which is unlikely;\nbut hadid, as an adjective, means adjacent, bordering on; thus the\nhadida was essentially a piece for the border of a sleeve.

The reason for these low\nprices was the absence of precious stone settings, emphasized\nabove.**' While the hands of some of our contemporaries glitter with\nsparkling diamonds, even a modest carnelian is rarely mentioned in\nthe Geniza, probably because the value of those half-precious stones\nwas minimal in comparison with that of the gold or silver needed for\na ring. Khatam, or khatim (as it was already pronounced in the\neleventh century®*), literally means seal ring. But a ring bearing the\nname of a Jewish woman is known to me only from Christian Spain,\nand when two golden filigree khatims plus two silver khatims were\nvalued at 2 dinars, that is 1/2 dinar apiece, or when one could have a\nsilver khatim for a quarter dinar, one doubts whether these rings\nhad a stone at all.*** Beside the occasional occurrence of stone\nsettings, filigree, and pearls, amber is noted as an adornment or as\nthe material; one bride had one ring of gold, two of silver, and one of\namber.?* The majority of khatims appear in pairs (two or four;\neight [see above] is exceptional), but the term “pair” is rarely used.\nThus, unlike bracelets, rings, as a rule, probably did not match.\n\nThe dabla (a term still common), a ring without a stone, seems to\nhave been rather massive in Geniza times. One of gold was valued at\n4 dinars in 1155; a pair of silver dibal was estimated as being worth\nthe same in 1186; and of particular interest is the trousseau of a\nremarrying widow, where two gold khatims cost 2 dinars, three\nsilver dablas, 9, and some silver khatims (their number is not pre-\nserved) together with a silver chain, 2 dinars. Most rings of this type\nwere made of silver, one of which was adorned with niello work. The\nkhatim occurs at least five times as often as the dabla 52\n\nAnklets, like bracelets, could be easily displayed by furtively pull-\ning the upper garment up or aside; therefore, both had to be heavy,\nwhich means expensive, betraying the bearer’s means and social\nstatus. In the passage translated at the beginning of this section on\nJjewelry it was the bracelets and anklets that attracted the attention of\nthe poet.

In a postscript to a letter a teacher from a learned family\nwrites to his brother: “Tell me, have you already made a ‘Bible’ for\nyour boy—or only anklets?” Meaning: to study the holy scriptures is\na better protection against any evil than to wear silver or gold.***\n\nAt the dressing table.—The list of ornaments in the marriage con-\ntract of a middle-class bride usually ends with some utensils made of\nprecious materials such as silver, crystal, ebony, or ivory for her\ndressing table. Costly objects of lighting, heating, dining, fumigat-\ning, and freshening were occasionally brought in by the bride, but it\nseems to have been customarily the duty of the husband to provide\nthem. They are treated in the subsections “Furnishings” and\n“Houseware” (A, 4 and 5), above. The trunks and chests, often\nornamented with mother-of-pearl and ivory, in which the wife kept\nher wardrobe, regularly formed part of her dowry, and are also\ndiscussed under “Furnishings,” because they contributed so much to\nthe look of the interior of a house.\n\nNeedless to say, item number one on the dressing table was the\nmirror. The grocming and dressing of a woman is described in a\nfamily letter in this sequence: “She paints her face, combs her hair,\nputs on her pendants [or earrings], dresses, and goes out.” Prac-\ntically all the brides in our Appendix D had a mir'ah muhallah, an\nornamented mirror, the “rich bride” (Doc. I11, like that in Doc. X ¢)\npossessed two, one costing 10 dinars, the highest price noted, and\nanother, a round one, valued at 6 dinars, which was the average\nprice (5 being the most common).”* Ornamented meant embel-\nlished with silver adornments, as is evident from those cases where\nthe mirror is described as “ornamented with silver,” or “with a silver\ndecoration,” or “inlaid with silver.”*® We read also about a round\nmirror with a silver cover and one “encased,” costing 8 1/12 di-\nnars.®®\" In short, just as in jewelry adorned meant with pearls, in\nmirrors it meant with silver. A respectable bride could not do with-\nout a silver mirror. Silver, however, was scarce and expensive in the\ntwelfth century. In two marriage contracts from the end of the\ncentury, iron mirrors, valued at 1/2 and 1 dinar, respectively, are\nnoted, and others in a similar price range might have been set in the\nsame material**® In a letter of the judge Elijah b. Zachariah (see\nIndex) to his mother in Alexandria, she receives an Indian mirror\n(probably sent to him from Aden as a present). But Egypt was a\ngreat center for the manufacture of silver vessels; most of the objects\nmentioned probably were locally made.***\n\nNext to the mirror in prestige on the dressing table was the jewel\n\nGoitein, S.

A strange development is to be ob-\nserved in respect to jewel boxes: whereas in the tenth and eleventh\ncenturies much money was spent on them, in the twelfth compara-\ntively little was expended because silver had then become scarce, and\none preferred to use it for the adornment of the body and not for\nthat of a utensil hidden away in a woman’s dressing cabinet.\n\nIn the very first detailed trousseau list preserved (Damascus, 933)\nthe “container of precious objects” was valued at 15 dinars. A silver\njewel box from the early eleventh century cost from 10 to 20 dinars;\nat its end, a price of 14 dinars is quoted; and the Karaite bride of\n1117 still had one worth 8 dinars. A business letter from the later\nhalf of the eleventh century with a big order for silver vessels from\nEgypt lists a beautiful durj as the first item.*** In later lists I found\nonly one instance of a silver durj worth 5 dinars (1156). Whereas in\nthe dowries of the “rich bride” and her younger contemporary, the\nsilver durj was lumped together with other objects and could hardly\nhave cost more than 2 dinars, if not much less.>**\n\n‘The earlier listings occasionally include specifications concerning\nthe make of a durj. A marriage contract from 995 describes it as\nmuhrag, burnished with gold, and another from 1050, as adorned\nwith filigree and sandalwood. A document from 1063, written in\nZawilat al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, but referring to objects left in Egypt\nand belonging to a woman, lists a box made of ebony adorned with\ncopper; this combination of the dark-colored heartwood with the\nreddish shining metal must have been striking. An ebony durj for\nsanin, tooth care materials (toothpicks and powder), costing 5 di-\nnars, is noted in a marriage contract of a well-to-do woman written\naround 1028, a high price for a receptacle with so modest a\npurpose.®®\n\nTurning now to the utensils used for beauty care, one is im-\npressed by the mass of material related to the application of kohl to\nthe eyes. It was a ritual of almost religious significance. When Queen\nJezebel knew that she was going to be killed, “she painted her eyes\nwith kohl”—an indispensable adornment for dying in royal splen-\ndor (2 Kings 9:30). From the Geniza it is evident that neglecting this\naspect of bodily care was an offense to the husband.®*’\n\nThe main equipment for eye paint was the mukhula, or kohl jar,\nwhich, as I learned from Marilyn Jenkins, then, as in ancient Egypt\nand in Hellenistic times, as well as in nineteenth-century Egypt, had\nthe shape of a tiny Greek amphora.®*® In the majority of cases it was\nmade of billawr, which is usually translated as crystal, and was some-\ntimes decorated with a golden rim or closed with a silver lid.

In one case we know from\nwhich part of the world the material came. After his return from\nIndia and Yemen (early 1150s), Ben Yiju notes, in one of his inven-\ntories, “3 crystal kohl jars.” In 1156 his daughter had them in her\ntrousseau—valued at 3 dinars. With one possible exception, all my\nreferences to crystal are from the twelfth century and later. A\nnumber of kohl jars were made of silver, or at least adorned with it,\nand worth at most 2 dinars.** The “rich bride” had an ivory kohl jar,\ncosting 3 dinars. Naturally, she had to be different. But perhaps she\nwas not so different from other girls of her status, for the word used\nhere for ivory came to mean jar or flask in general, as happened with\nthe word mukhula itself.>*\n\nKohl was appled with a small ornamented probe (mil, derived\nfrom Greek), listed once as made of crystal, but mostly of silver, four\nof them in an eleventh-century document valued at 1 dinar. An\nadmirably detailed description of this important part of female toilet\nmay be read in Lane’s Modern Egyptians.** Being ornamental, a mil\ncould be worn “on the cheek,” probably hanging down from the\nheadgear.”* Together with its case, it is referred to as mirwad, a\nmore elaborate piece of jewelry, repeatedly noted as being made of\nsilver and worth I dinar.**® A favorite place to store the kohl stick, a\ntiny, but essential utensil of makeup, was in a perforated figurine,\nsuch as a crystal cock, a lion, or an amber gazelle.*** Numerous such\nfigurines have been preserved, and I believe that the amber tamathil,\nor figurines, in the outfits of the Mistress of the Persians and the\nMistress of Baghdad, and unspecified numbers of amber tamathil\nvalued at 5 dinars found in twelfth- and thirteenth-century lists\nserved the same purpose.®*\n\nCombs, if described at all, were made of silver, and one such could\nbe had for 1 or 2 dinars. The “rich bride” had a silver comb for\n4 dinars. But a Karaite widow possessed a golden comb worth 16 di-\nnars, whereas her rosewater sprinkler was valued at only 8 1/2 di-\nnars. Once an ivory comb is listed in an outfit.*** When a mother in\nFustat asks her son (who was staying in an inn in the Jewish quarter\nof Alexandria) to buy for her, among other wooden utensils, a very\nfine comb, she probably had in mind one made of European box-\nwood, according to a Muslim handbook of market supervision the\nonly material to be used for combs for both men and women. The\nplea of the mother made in the same letter not to drink wine—\nstrange, since the letter is addressed to “the scholar from Fustat,\nAbu ’l-Mahasin”—has also to do with a product imported from\nEurope: the Greek and Italian wines, relished by the Jewish jeunesse\n\nGoitein, S.

When the Persian king Shahpur\nwished to enjoy pleasant scents—the Talmud relates—he sent for\nhis daughter, whose well-groomed body provided the most effective\nfragrance. The Book of Esther 2:12 drastically reveals that only by\nintensive and protracted care could such perfection be obtained.\nIslam inherited this infatuation from Persia, and the Jews living\nunder Islam (who had themselves an ancient tradition in this respect\n[Song of Songs 1:3; 4:10]) followed suit, although opinions about\nthe propriety of male perfuming were divided. Concerning females\nthere was no doubt. Supplying poor brides with aromatic ointments\nwas a religious duty. As for the Land of the Nile, reliefs and count-\nless little artifacts illustrate the variegated cosmetic activities of the\nwomen of ancient Egypt.”*\n\nOintments and perfumes, like medications, were composed of\nvarious ingredients. The most needed utensil on the dressing table\nwas therefore a mixing vessel in which the woman of the house could\nprepare mixtures to her heart’s content to suit every occasion.

In addition to her crystal\nmixer, Sitt al-Hasab had another with four silver lids (Doc. 1V,\ncol. I, 1. 12); naturally, the perfumes had to be preserved in tight\ncompartments.

The poor Karaite\nbride from Jerusalem 1028 had one (App. D, Doc. 1, 1. 24). A\nmarriage contract written in 1105 lists “a small ointment jar, two\nvery small silver cintment jars with one silver spoon for the lab-\ndanum, and another silver spoon for the ghaliya,” and there are\nother such utensils from the eleventh and twelfth centuries.**\n\nReturning now from the dressing table to the ornaments and\ntheir wearer, 1 wish to conclude with this remark in Graham\nHughes, jewelry: “The most popular, but the least public of all\npossessions, jewels intrigue one’s close friends, not the crowd in the\nstreets; they satisfy only in private, they reserve their charms for\nintimacy.”**® If such a statement could be made in the England of the\ntwentieth century, how much more did it apply to a Jewish woman\nliving in an Islamic environment a thousand or so years ago. In the\nSong of Songs (7:2) the body of the beloved is itself praised as a\ncreation of the jeweler’s art. Jewelry was intended not only to protect\nits wearer from need (and, possibly, the evil eye), but, above all, to\nenhance her charms in the intimacy of matrimonial life.\n\nIn this section it was necessary to dwell on the price of ornaments\n5o as to assign each piece its proper place in the hierarchy of the\nartistic means of attraction.

Muslim sayings singled\nout the Jews for being particularly dedicated to culinary relish.\n“Sleep in a Christian bed and enjoy Jewish food,” says a widely\nknown maxim.? Even more outspoken is this observation, made\nprobably already in early Islamic times: “Of the good things of this\nworld the Muslims enjoy most sex; the Christians, money, the\nPersians, status; and the Jews, food.”™\n\nThe reputation of Jewish food in its Islamic environment was\nprobably attributable to its specialities, necessitated by Jewish reki-\ngious law. On the Sabbath all cooking is prohibited, but, naturally,\none wanted warm food particularly on the day of rest, when there\nwas time to enjoy it. Special preparations had to be made for this\npurpose, and it is a common human trait that dishes different from\nthose to which we are accustomed arouse our curiosity and whet our\nappetite. A story about such a Sabbath dish for which Jews had\nalready been renowned in pre-Islamic Arabia—and which Jews\nfrom Arabia, namely, those coming from Yemen, using the same\nterm, still prepare—is too beautiful not to be told. The haris(a) is a\nsemolina dough which is stuffed with meat and fat, such as lamb’s\ntail, and spices. During the long process of warming, the dough\nbecomes saturated with the taste of meat, fat, and spices, unlike a\nregular harisa that is consumed shortly after preparation.* The\nstory centers on the jovial caliph Mu‘awiya (661—680) who loved\npoetry, fun—and wine.\n\nAt Mu‘awiya’s request, a Jew at a party recited a poem by his\nfather, in which the latter glorified himself. When the caliph re-\nmarked that such glory belonged only to the ruler, the Jew asserted\nthat his father had more claim to high praise than anyone. Two\nboon companions of the caliph scolded the Jew for being so impu-\ndent, and the latter retorted angrily. To change the subject,\nMu ¢awiya asked the Jew: “Does your family still prepare the harisa\nas well as it did in pre-Islamic times?” “Even better,” replied the Jew,\nwhereupon he was requested to prepare some, which the caliph\nconsumed. The gist of the anecdote was probably that Jewish food\nwas better than Jewish poetry.®\n\nI should start by saying that I have not found in the Geniza a\nsingle description of a specifically Jewish dish or meal, or, for that\nmatter, of any dish or meal. In view of the hospitality that prevailed\nin their society, with its invitations to weekends, holidays, weddings,\nand similar occasions, and the reverence shown to distinguished\nguests, this deficiency is hard to explain.

If the food was good, it was obvious; people ate it and there\nwas little of it left. Why should one talk about it?*?\n\nThe widely diversified civilization of the medieval Near East was\nnot unified in its attitude toward food. The secularly minded,\nsophisticated courtiers and government officials, together with their\ncompany of litterateurs and philosophers, enjoyed talking about\nfood, just as the intellectuals of Late Antiquity had done before\nthem. An abundance of treatises on cookery was available as early as\nthe fourth century of Islam.® In that century, the famous medical\nwriter Ishaq al-Isra'ili, known in medieval Europe as Isaac Judaeus,\nwrote a four-volume book on foodstuffs and their value for human\nhealth. Thus there was also much serious thinking and research on\nthe subject.'*\n\nIt is true, however, that the bulk of the population, which was in\nthe bondage of religion, had scruples with regard to food: one might\nenjoy this sustainer of life, but should give praise to its provider,\nGod. The disregard for the preparers of meals, male or female, was\nonly one aspect of that general contempt for the banausus, the\nmechanic, the technician, which the Near East had inherited, at least\npartly, from the Greek. Finally, refraining from commenting on\nfood was a part of good table manners, avoiding both the impression\nof gluttony and the pitfalls of half-hearted praise, which might be\ntaken as blame for the quality of the dishes.”\n\n“The Egyptians eat very moderately,” writes E. W. Lane, a keen\nand competent observer, in the 1830s. The same impression is\ngained from the Geniza. To become obese by eating too much was\nregarded as a disgrace. A glutton, mujallih, literally, a man who\nmakes the tray “bald,” empty, before others serve themselves, was an\nodious figure. One left his byname as family name to his son.'¢ To be\nsure, for a refugee from Morocco, Egypt was the “Land of Life,” and\na Palestinian enjoyed Egyptian conviviality, food, drink, and music\nso much that he forgot to go home to his wife and children.'” But the\nscarcity of references to the enjoyments of food in the Geniza letters\nseems to indicate that their writers were hardly Sybarites.\n\nOne normally ate two meals a day, a light morning meal, ghada’,\nand a more substantial evening meal, ‘asha’.’® This had been com-\nmon custom in the Near East in antiquity (and is widely discussed in\nthe Talmud), and was still habitual in Egypt in E. W. Lane's time. In\nother words, the “breakfast,” the breaking of the nightly fast, was\nnot yet divided into déjeuner and petit déjeuner; one ate only one\nmorning meal. After prayer one went to work, and, approximately\nfour hours after sunrise, some food was taken at work.'® Therefore,\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Therefore on holidays one\npermitted oneself the luxury of a costly sheep’s tail, that embodi-\nment of fattiness.”” Honoring a holiday with fat food was already\ntaken for granted in biblical times.*® But the Talmud reports a\npopular saying from Palestine condemning the sheep’s tail, not for\nmedical reasons, but as a luxury. Vegetables were preferable.*® The\nsheep’s tail is still popular in Egypt.\n\nAnother remarkable trait of the lists presented is the writers’\npredilection for vegetables. This Jewish proclivity is attested to in\nthe Bible and the Talmud; as we have seen, even the intrinsically\nEgyptian muliikhiya had—and still has—the byname “Jewish vege-\ntable.” According to Rav Huna, the outstanding Babylonian sage, a\nscholar was not permitted to live in a place that had no vegetables.*\nRoger Le Tourneau’s observation that the Jewish infatuation with\nvegetables was sufficient reason for the Muslims of Fez to shun\neating them has been already noted.* As Cérés Wissa Wassef’s book\non presenting Coptic cooking shows, all the vegetables noted above\nare still richly used in the modern Egyptian kitchen.®\n\nIt is to be expected that lists originating with people in modest\ncircumstances include only the more common fruits such as dates,\napples, lemons, and bitter oranges.*® But fruits were eagerly sought\nafter. When the somewhat eccentric clerk Solomon b. Elijah excused\nhimself for not expressing his sympathy to a friend in person, on\naccount of illness, he adds this postscript so that everyone would\nunderstand how really sick he was: “Bananas, figs, grapes, water-\nmelon, fish, and beans, by my soul, none of these were tasted by me\nthis week.” Indeed, none of these delicacies was offered to the sick\nforeigner mentioned above.**\n\nWheat and bread.—My assertion in the very first sentence of this\nsection, that the Geniza contains little about food, seems to be belied\nby the countless reports and inquiries about the prices and avail-\nability of wheat and bread found in the Geniza letters throughout\nthe centuries.®® The data from the Geniza, which reflect actual\nexperience, are generally more realistic and reliable than those\nprovided by Islamic literary sources, which are often given in round\nsums and written down long after their occurrence.® But the Geniza\ndata, too, betray bewildering fluctuations.

The mind of the average man, that\nof the middle class included, was constantly preoccupied with pro-\nviding his household with the most urgently needed life-sustaining\nfood. In times of a low Nile and other disasters befalling agriculture,\nfamine, epidemics, breakdown of public order, or, who knows,\nshameless grain speculations, such apprehensions were natural.®”\nBut the Geniza letters seem to betray that state of mind even when\nthe prices reported appear to have been normal, as far as such a\nthing existed. This is a story not of food but of its scarcity. All one\ncan do here is explore how the insecurity surrounding the most basic\nfood of the population influenced the organization of its daily life\nand affected its thinking.\n\nWhoever had the means to buy wheat at harvest time laid in a\nsufficient supply for the year. Hence the strong admonitions in\nletters “I have no more urgent request from you than the [purchase\nof] wheat and grapes” (for making wine, see below), or “do not\nneglect the wheat, for it is one of the most basic of all things,” or the\nassurance “Don’t worry, I have taken care of the purchase of the\nwheat, put it into jars and put [the jars] into the sun.”®® The wheat\nwas ground at a local mill, and the dough, prepared at home, was\nbaked at a bakery. This procedure had the triple advantage of being\ncheaper than buying bread daily, of affording safety against the\nfluctuations of the market or the outright unavailability of the food-\nstuff, and, finally, of knowing what went into one’s bread, although\nits quality perhaps did not differ as much as in Europe (perhaps\nslightly later than Geniza times).*® Laying in provisions carried the\nrisk that the wheat would deteriorate or spoil altogether, or that\nburglars or robbers would take them away. To avoid such disasters\none stored the wheat in big jars of porous clay, put them on the\nuppermost floor of the house, and, if feasible, on its sunny side,\nprobably to protect it from humidity.™\n\nThe standard measurement of wheat was the irdabb, measuring\nabout 90 liters and weighing about 70 kilograms. It was divided into\nsix waybas, also extremely common. At the distribution of wheat to\nthe needy (on the eves of holidays or fasts) quarters or halves of a\nwayba were handed out to each.™\n\nTwelve irdabbs per year, or one per month seem to have been the\nquantity of wheat needed for an average middle-class household.\nTwelve are ordered as yearly provisions in a letter written around\n1210, and ten in another missive sent from Alexandria to Cairo at\napproximately the same time. “In case the wheat cannot be had,\n\nGoitein, S.

Joseph (dated documents 1088—1116), a traveling mer-\nchant with his seat in Alexandria orders one irdabb of sieved wheat\nevery month; he clearly did not wish to receive the entire quantity of\nthe yearly provision at once, because, as he mentions, the price was\nhigh (only four waybas for 1 dinar).™\n\nWhen the size of the household was reduced by the absence of\nhusband or wife, the average yearly provision was six irdabbs, and\nthe monthly one was half, or three waybas. The convert and new-\ncomer from Europe, referred to above, who stipulated his right to\nput six irdabbs on the upper floor occupied by his partner certainly\nhad not yet founded a new family in Egypt (Al-Mahalla, 1121).”\nWhen a well-to-do merchant went away on a long journey (probably\nto India or beyond), he earmarked the regular twelve irdabbs of\nwheat per year for his wife; her household comprised only a little\nboy and a servant with a daughter. But her old parents lived in the\nsame house (Fustat, 1143).” In a similar case, where, however, no\nold parents were in the house, the wife of an India trader, a mother\nof two little girls, received five irdabbs per year, and the same\nquantity was foreseen by the court clerk Mevorakh b.

        "text": "ix,C, 1 Food 237\n\n1107 presuppose that a hundred loaves of bread could be had for\nhalf a dinar. Since half a dinar corresponded approximately to\n20 dirhems, five loaves of bread could be had for one dirhem, and,\nof course, more at wholesale. One baker provided the community\nwith about 500 loaves. The individual buyer probably paid a little bit\nmore. Yet, those painstaking lists (betraying a concern that no one\nshould get more than he deserved) give the impression that they\nwere compiled in times of stress. The average number of loaves to be\nhad for a dirhem was probably more than five loaves.**\n\nA number of passages reflecting the fluctuations in the prices of\nwheat and bread will enable the reader to judge for himself how far\nthe Geniza is able to illustrate the social aspects of this intricate\nproblem of economic history. The time of our first example is fixed\nby a postscript: “The sheykh Abi** Munajja occupies today a very\nhigh rank and place.” Abii Munajja, a Jew in the service of the\nEgyptian viceroy al-Malik al-Afdal, supervised the construction of a\ncanal in the eastern Nile Delta named after the supervisor during\nthe years 1113—1119.% The time of writing, therefore, was the\nbeginning of the second decade of the twelfth century. The writer, a\nMaghrebi living in Cairo, implores his brother-in-law, a physician, to\nreturn his wife to him, who, as often happened, had fled from her\nhusband to her brother. The letter concludes with this note which is\nwritten around the four margins of the second page and which is\nfollowed by the postscript:\n\nBy God, do not disappoint me, my lord, but kindly send my wife back to\nCairo in the company of her Maghrebi relatives. For leading the life of a\nbachelor in Cairo is very, very difficult; I can’t bear it. Qur prices in Cairo:\nnine pounds of pure bread—1 1/8 dirhems. Wheat (regular)—two irdabbs\n[for 1 dinar). Good [wheat]: nine and a half waybas [for I dinar). Bread does\nnot sell, it is cheap. After the first third of the night some of mine still\nremained in the bazaar.*\n\nThese lines were written at a time of oversupply. As we shall\nlearn, an irdabb of wheat costing half a dinar was indeed excep-\ntional. A weak economy is unable to control glut, just as it is power-\nless against scarcity. The big difference between regular and good\nwheat is remarkable, and the quotation “nine pounds of good\nbread—1 1/8 dirhems” instead of “a pound of bread—1/8 dirhem,”\nseems to indicate that larger quantities were lower in price. The\nwriter, himself a baker, or proprietor of a bakery, certainly knew\nwhat he was talking about. The extensive letter shows him to be a\nman of some learning.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The writer must have been a respectable person, since he\ngives personal greetings to Moses Maimonides and to the French\nrabbi, Anatoli (who temporarily sojourned in Fustat). He must have\nbeen a man of some means, as may be concluded from his order of\nten irdabbs of wheat when it was so costly, a quantity sufficient for\napproximately a year.®\n\nAlexandria is in great trouble: the price of wheat from Upper Egypt,*\nbought from the houses,” is 225 dinars per hundred [irdabbs];* every\nwayba costs 14 waraq dirhems.” The mediocre Rifi (Delta) wheat costs\n200 dinars a hundred, the bread—one and a half loaves—1 dirhem.”®\nPeople eat up one another. This catastrophe came upon the population\nquite suddenly, may God grant relief in his mercy. Your slave was able to\npurchase only three irdabbs and most of it has already been consumed. May\nI ask you to get the wheat under all circumstances. Your servant is [like one]\nof your family. May I never miss you.*\n\nPlease instruct the Muslim who takes care of the wheat that he should\nenter the city relying on his high rank,'® for this [Jewish] nation is closely\nwatched'! by the gentiles, who menace them with plunder every day.’*\n\nIn another letter, from a provincial town it seems, we read indeed\nabout seventy irdabbs of wheat taken from a house during a\npillage.'®®\n\nThe price of 2 dinars or so for one irdabb seems to have been\ncommon in times of scarcity. In a report to a notable, who appears in\nnumerous Geniza documents around 1200, he is informed that a\nman was paid 30 dinars for fifteen irdabbs, bought for the Fustat\ncommunity, probably to provide bread for the indigent.'** Sixty\nyears earlier, in the 1140s, there were some bad years, reflected in\nthe Geniza by the many lists of the poor preserved from that period.\nAbu Zikri Kohen, from whose hand we have many dated documents\nfrom that decade, paid 6 1/4 dinars for three irdabbs.'* The time of\nthe great famine, 10631073, is represented in the correspondence\nof Nahray b. Nissim by wild fluctuations of prices, sometimes re-\nferred to in one and the same letter (see below). One irdabb costing\n2 dinars seems to have indicated that hunger and anarchy prevailed\nin the writer’s place. “Everything edible is sold [or salable]. The\nwheat: three [waybas] for one gold piece [that is, one irdabb for\n2 dinars; both words are written in Hebrew, a kind of secret code].\nThe city, as you know, is afflicted by hunger—may God make it\neasier for you,” we read in a letter to Nahray from Alexandria.'*\n\nGoitein, S.

A traveling silk mer-\nchant, who had passed weeks, including a holiday, in the Rif, after\nvisiting Alexandria, where for only 1 dinar four and a half waybas\ncould be had, asked his partner in Fustat to send two irdabbs to him\nin Rosetta (on the Mediterranean coast). Despite the cost of trans-\nportation grain was cheaper and more easily available in the capital\nthan in the countryside.''® The recurrent price of 2 dinars, probably\ntwice the “normal,” for an irdabb was perhaps fixed by government\norder in the big cities at the time of scarcity.\n\nThe 1020s saw another period of famine, again reflected in the\nGeniza by extended and carefully executed lists of recipients of\nhandouts.”\" Here some noteworthy data can be observed. A busi-\nness letter sent from Cairo to Qus, the terminus of the India trade in\nUpper Egypt, around 1030 or earlier, notes in the midst of a very\nlong list of prices prevailing in the capital: “Wheat, one #llis 3\n[dinars).” The tillis, weighing about 67.5 kilograms, was almost\nidentical with the irdabb (about 70 kilograms).!** Thus this price was\nextraordinary and is noted by the Fatimid historian al-Musabbihi\nfor the hunger year 1024.\"* But the writer of the letter does not\nmention this horrid price with indignation. Quite the contrary. He\nintroduces his list with the remark “The [prices in the] bazaar are as\nyou love it.” Here the supplier, not the consumer, is addressed.\nCairene merchants went up to Qs to purchase Indian and other\nOriental specialities, but used the occasion to carry with them some\nof the wheat of Upper Egypt, which was renowned for its quality.\"**\n\nA letter from Alexandria shows how those exorbitant prices were\ncombated: one imported wheat from abroad. “Eight to nine waybas\nof the Riimi wheat we have here cost 1 dinar; we do not miss a thing;\nlife is cheap here, and people have it far better than before.”*!\nAnother letter from Alexandria and the same period has this: “The\nprice of new wheat: nine waybas per dinar, old wheat—eleven\nwaybas.”**® Thus a price of 1 dinar for nine waybas of good wheat,\n\nGoitein, S.

Nissim, when he had\nalready become a merchant of substance in Egypt, say, around 1060:\n“Prices in Ifrigiya [Africa, approximately Tunisia today] are ex-\ntremely low: 25 thumns of wheat cost 1 dinar in Qayrawan [the\ncapital].” This corresponds approximately to 12/3 irdabbs, very\ncheap if compared with the “cheap” 1 1/2, listed in Alexandria.'*”\nBut not long before, we read about a terrible rise of prices in\nIfrigiya: for 1 dinar only 4 thumns could be had!**®\n\nThe upshot of all this seems to be that to draw generalizations\nabout the times and regions in terms of the prices mentioned in the\nGeniza is hazardous. In particular, one must avoid the pitfall of\naccepting as normal prices noted as a relief from former hardship.\nThe correspondence of Nahray b. Nissim is full of such cases.\nExamples from the early thirteenth century, some time after the\ngreat famine of 1201/2, illustrate the problem. In a letter to judge\nElijah b. Zechariah, then still in Alexandria, the writer notes that he\nwas unable to buy wheat because of its exorbitant price of 20 (dir-\nhems a wayba, 120 dirhems, or over $ dinars, an irdabb). An un-\nhappy father in that Mediterranean port, whose son had disap-\npeared, reportedly “to the army,” sends several missives to Elijah’s\nson, a physician in the capital, with the request to contact the fugi-\ntive, assuring him that the situation in the country had improved:\n“Alexandpria is now quiet, no disturbances have occurred—may God\nmake the end well—an irdabb of wheat costs 1 5/8 dinars.” The\nwriter does not mean to say that 1 1/2 dinars or so was an acceptable,\nnormal price, but that, compared with times of anarchy and inse-\ncurity of the roads, the price was an improvement.'** When a silk\nweaver escaped from the tax collector to Aswan in Upper Egypt, he\nwas assured by his family in Fustat that he had nothing to fear and\nthat times had become better. “An irdabb of wheat of middle quality\ncosts 42 dirhems—may God make it cheaper.” Low-grade wheat\nshould be priced somewhat below, not above, 1 dinar (see above).\nBut the somewhat high price is reported to convince the fugitive that\nhe could make ends meet anyhow, if he returned.'*\n\nIn extraordinary times, the price of wheat fluctuated so wildly\nthat the change is reported in one and the same letter. “It was\n4 dinars for one irdabb and stands today at 2 1/2 dinars,” we read in\na letter from Alexandria to Nahray b. Nissim. Since in the same\nletter the writer reports that he had already purchased wheat for the\nhigher price and put it aside for the recipient, some time may have\nelapsed between the two quotations.'*!\n\nThis cannot be said of a letter sent to the notable Judah b.

Many Jewish families had left the city, but were held\nup on their way; even the prominent Dési family was considering\nleaving. Numerous maidservants had run away to the Bedouins, and\nthe writer was afraid that the slave agent whom her husband had left\nbehind to look after the business might do the same. And worst of\nall: “The tillis [of wheat, approximately = one irdabb] has already\nreached 30 [dinars].” In a long postscript she reports that the Dosas\nhad left on the very day she was writing, that the chief vizier had\nexpelled all other viziers from the town, “and we are exposed to\nanarchy and hunger [both words in Hebrew], one tillis [of wheat] costs\n25 [dinars] and bread 4 1/2 [dirhems] a pound.” The prices quoted\nby a Muslim historian for this period are four times as high.'**\n\nThe writer speaks only of Jewish families leaving the city because\nshe probably knew few Muslims, and because the latter had less to\nfear than the former. An exodus of Muslims from a city smitten by\nfamine is reported by a Jew to emphasize the magnitude of the\ndisaster. The Jewish judge of Barqa, eastern Libya, who sojourned\nin Alexandria on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem (which he failed to\ncarry out), writes that he was forced to return home, for he had\nreceived bad news from his native town: “Itis in ruins; most Muslims\nhave gone into exile from there, the wheat costs one wayba a dinar,\nand business is at a standstill” (1060 or so).'**\n\nMoving to Tripoli, the capital of western Libya, during “a year,\nthe like of which no one has witnessed and no one knows even from\nhearsay,” we read that at Passover-Easter half a wayba cost 1 dinar\n(one irdabb = 12 dinars), but at the time of the writing of the letter,\nin August or slightly later of the same year, three waybas could be\nhad for that price (one irdabb = 2 dinars). A new harvest had\nintervened and some import of wheat must have helped, but both\nwere not enough to reduce the price to so-called normal completely.\nYet, the letter concludes: “We are now all right, and the city is\nquiet.”***\n\nThe transport of grain was supervised by the government, partly,\nperhaps, to insure that the relevant taxes had been paid, and partly\nfor the purpose of confiscating it in times of emergency. Hence, in\nsuch times, we find the terms for wheat and coins written in Hebrew,\nserving as a kind of code, or reports about actual attempts to conceal\nconsignments of wheat. “I tried to transport, together with the flax,\n50 or, at least 30, irdabbs [of wheat], but was unable to do so, for the\nclerk came in,” we read in a letter from the flax district of Bahnasa\nsent to Fustat.’”® A missive addressed to a business friend in Tunisia\ncontains this instruction: “Buy me 3 qafiz'*® of wheat or whatever\n\nGoitein, S.

When the court clerk Mevorakh b.\nNathan on coming home discovered that a friend had failed to\nprovide his family with wheat during his absence on a journey, he\nfound it worth mentioning in a letter to an esteemed friend that it\nwas extremely burdensome for him to buy five pounds of flour\ncosting 1 1/8 dirhems every day.'*® A large section of the population\nbought flour because they did not possess the means to buy wheat at\nharvest time but still preferred to prepare their bread dough at\nhome, or were simply too poor to buy any wheat at all, so they had to\napply to the flour dealer when they had a penny available or a pawn\nto leave with him.'*®* Moreover, many types of food, such as sweet-\nmeats or the harisa hamburger, were admixed with flour. Thus it\nseems likely that just as Jews, with few exceptions, did not deal in\ngrain, they did not engage in the sale of flour. One ordered flour in\nlarge quantities only when wheat was not available, or for other\nspecial reasons.'*\n\nOn the preceding pages I have used the word loaf for the sake of\nconvenience, although Near Eastern bread is flat, round, and soft, to\nbe easily broken by hand (no knife being needed) into pieces, which\ncan be used, instead of forks or spoons, for picking up morsels from\na tray. I must remark, however, that in a very detailed account of\nhousehold expenses the writer constantly uses, in addition to the\ngeneral word for bread, two other terms designating its form. It\nescapes me whether this was a mere play on words, or whether\nindeed two different shapes of bread were intended.\"*\n\nBarley was completely absent from the table of the urban popula-\ntion, as far as the Geniza goes. This testimony of a respectable\nmerchant, who had to flee from Alexandria before an oppressive\ngovernment official and to hide in the western desert for years,\nunderlines this fact: “Then I passed a year and a half in other\npeople’s houses, and most of the time begging for a saof barley,\nwhich I ground with my own hands. . . . I'sent home two flat cakes of\nunleavened barley bread, each weighing only fifteen dirhems, to\nshow them on what food I lived.” In the very rare cases where the\nprice of barley is noted, the reference is probably to fodder for\nanimals.'*\n\nTo sum up.

I have tried to bring this situation—so strange to us—home to\nthe reader by ample citations from both times of scarcity and abun-\ndance. They reflect the extraordinary place occupied by wheat in\nthe daily diet of Near Eastern—Mediterranean peoples.\n\nAnother remarkable aspect seems to emerge from the texts pro-\nvided above: a certain standardization of consumption achieved by\nthat age-old measurement of wheat, the irdabb, introduced during\nthe Persian occupation of Egypt, about fifteen hundred years prior\nto the period of the Geniza documents. Twelve irdabbs a year, one a\nmonth, seem to have been the average need assumed for an urban\nhousehold, and one gold piece seems to have been the ideal price for\none. A pound was the average weight of a loaf of bread. Such\nstandardization, imposed not from above, but derived from experi-\nence, would indicate that eating habits were common to a fairly large\nsection of the urban population.!®\n\n“All the things men eat with bread.”—When the Byzantine emperor\nAlexius I Comnenus (1081—1118) founded a town for the poor and\nthe crippled, he endowed it with good lands “so that they should\nhave all the things that men eat with bread.”'** This note from the\nAlexiad of the emperor’s gifted daughter Anna Comnena reminds\nus that the absolute prominence of bread as human nourishment\nwas not confined to the Muslim society of the Mediterranean, nor\ndid it originate there. On the contrary. Witness the cry of the Roman\nmasses for “bread and games” and of the Roman soldier who con-\nquered the world, while receiving as daily fare rations of bread and\nwine (which often had the taste of vinegar). The Bible expresses the\nidea of having one’s meal by the sentence: “They sat down to eat\nbread” (Genesis 37:25). And it has already been noted that both\nHebrew and Arabic possess special terms for “the things taken\ntogether with bread.”*\n\nI hasten to add that, even though we do not have the description\nof a full evening meal in the Geniza, the variety and quantities of\nspices, flavorings, and fruits, as well as the many details about meats,\ncheese, oils, honey, and sugar appearing in the documents point to\nthe fact that the table of families that could afford them was as richin\nappetizers, dishes, and desserts as could be observed in well-to-do\ntraditional homes in the Near East not long ago. Spices of all descrip-\ntions were the most frequently mentioned items and, consequently.\nmust have been equally well represented in the pantry. And one did\nnot need so many spices except when one prepared a good many\ndishes which needed different flavoring.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

This combination of almonds\nand raisins as ideal food remained alive in Jewish folklore.'*\nVine-growing must have been extensive in medieval Egypt, since\nwine, as the Geniza shows, was made from local grapes. Numerous\nletters speak, however, of importing of raisins for both eating and\nmaking beverages. Black raisins were preferred for eating.'>\nDates were the main indigenous fruit of Egypt. As far as urban\nconsumption is concerned, there was no need for laying in provi-\nsions; pressed dates were available, but as the household accounts\nreveal, one fetched one’s requirements of fresh dates from the\ngrocer. The situation was different in times of famine, that is,\nscarcity of wheat. Then the Geniza letters become replete with\norders for dates of all descriptions and with notifications how such\norders were carried out. These letters are worth studying in the\nwider context of the replacement of one major element of nutrition\nby another.'** As quick food for a scholar and as an alternative for\nalmonds and raisins, Maimonides, in a holograph preserved in the\nGeniza, recommends honey made of good, fresh dates mixed with\nwater, taken with bread. With a letter from the Fayyam, chicken and\ndates were sent as a present for the Day of Atonement. Did Jews, like\nMuslims, break the fast with dates?

A few fresh dates or sycamore figs might\nhave performed a similar service to a poor boy in medieval Cairo.\nThe second great provider of sweetness, sugar cane, was not\nindigenous to Egypt. It was transplanted there in early Islamic times\nfrom southern Iran and Iraq (to which countries it had come from\nIndia and farther east) and gave rise to a great industry, in which the\nJews had a disproportionally high share.'* This might have had its\nroots in a phenomenon found elsewhere, namely, that the sugar\nindustry was a new field of economic activity, and an oppressed\nminority could get a foothold in it more easily than in long-estab-\nlished enterprises. The fact that many Jewish families in Egypt had\ncome from southern Iran and Iraq might also have played a part.\nFinally, the Jewish propensity for sweetness, attested by Bible and\nTalmud, might have found the concentrated power of sugar partic-\nularly attractive.'®® Several sorts of sugar (depending on the number\nof cookings of the raw material and the fluids used for the process)\n\nGoitein, S.

The orders for\nsmall quantities of pepper and other spices used for preservation\nprove that they knew how to keep meat edible for some time. This\nnote from al-Mahalla, a provincial capital with a considerable Jewish\npopulation, presupposes the same: “At present, there is no com-\nmunal ritual slaughtering here, neither good nor bad. When they\nfeel the desire for meat, they buy a sheep and slaughter it, each in his\nhouse.”\"®® In Fustat, people who could afford it had a lamb\nslaughtered for their private needs whenever they wished. In an\naccount written at the time of the caliph al-Zahir (1021—1036), or\nslightly later, such alamb (sold for a household, not to a butcher) cost\n1 1/4 dinars.

But the pigeons kept in cne’s house were carrier\npigeons, trained for races, a sport much enjoyed by Jews (and not\nonly in Fustat), who were preceded in this hobby by Greeks, Ro-\nmans, Byzantines, and Muslims, high and low.'\"\n\nAs much as we read in the Geniza about chickens, as little we learn\nfrom it about the consumption of eggs. The reason might have been\ntechnical: one bought them in the market, or peasant women\nbrought them over; so there was no occasion to mention them in\nletters. Or perhaps the transport of fresh eggs in quantities suffi-\ncient for the population of a town was then so difficult that this\nnutritious commodity was consumed far less than was done in our\nsocieties. A man writing to his mother in Cairo, who wished him to\nmarry a woman in that city, says this: “If, coming to Cairo, I could\nearn there every day two to three dirhems of full silver, I would\ncome. Then, buying two eggs, I would find someone who would\nmake them for me.” The words are meant, of course, sarcastically.\nFor two full silver dirhems (equivalent to six regular ones), one could\nhave three hens, not two eggs. Cairo, he wishes to say, was so\nexpensive that even if he earned well, all his future wife would be\nable to prepare for him was an omelette, a dish obviously not highly\nregarded. Once, when Abu Zikri Kohen (see the Index) went\nshopping for his household, he bought eggs for 1 1/2 dirhems. For\nthis sum he must have got a huge amount.

Since, for Jews, the\nproduction, transport, and sale of cheese had to be done under the\nsupervision of a responsible religious person, the Geniza supplies\nmuch information about this subject.'®* Of particular interest is this\ncertificate issued in Alexandria on 9 October 1214:\n\nMTr.

This certificate confirms what could\nhave been deduced from previously cited Geniza documents,\nnamely, that there was a steady import of cheese into Egypt and that\nit reached not only the big cities but also provincial towns. This is\nfurther corroborated by the letters of Aba ‘Ali Ezekiel to his\nbrother, the prominent India trader and communal leader Hal-\nfon b.

A late Geniza source reports that eight imprisoned\npersons got cheese for both morning and evening meals, of course,\nwith bread. They must have been pampered people.

This\nprocess, which began in remote antiquity, received new momentum\nin Islamic times, giving the urban kitchen its international character.\nOn the other hand, “the feshpots of Egypt” (Exodus 16:3) and “the\ngrain which is in Egypt” (Genesis 42: 1 —2) singled out the country as\nthe land of plenty in the Fatimid period as in Pharaonic times. As the\nbiblical accounts show, the predilection for sweetness and fat was not\nconfined to the land of the Nile, nor, I believe, to any age preceding\nthe acceptance of modern medical views.

This tallies with the observation of a visitor to the\ncountry that fresh grapes were hard to come by because they were\nmostly made into wine.* A Street of the Wine Sellers was found in\nCairo as early (or as late) as 1038, and in Fustat in 1156, although\nMuslim historians seem not to have noted them.® An early papyrus\nshows Ahmad the wine seller doing business.* The word for wine\nused in all these cases is the innocent nabidh, which could also\ndesignate beverages made of dates, bee honey, and the like, which\nwere sometimes, but by no means always, not inebriating. (The spicy\nEgyptian honey wine whose recipe is translated below, definitely\nwas.) The experts on Islamic law were of divided opinion as to\nwhich, if any, type of nabidh was permissible, but this proclivity for\nfooling oneself (and others) had the advantage that one was able to\ntalk openly about wine without causing offense. In the Geniza (and,\nI believe, also in Arabic literature) nabidh is as commonly used for\ngrape wine as the true word, the offensive khamr; and both, re-\nferring to the same stuff, appear in two consecutive lines of a letter\ncontaining the usual orders for laying in supplies of wheat and\nwine.®\n\nYet the proliferation of wine substitutes, and, in particular, of soft\ndrinks made with fruits, flower petals, vegetables, or spices, or\ncombinations of some of them, appearing in the Geniza as daily diet\nof the middle class proves that wine had been largely replaced by\nother beverages, not only in Islam but also in a minority group living\nin its midst.\n\nWine was consumed by middle-class Jews, and probably in con-\nsiderable quantities on Sabbaths, holidays, and at family or com-\nmunity feasts, such as betrothals, weddings, or circumcisions. It was\ntaken before the meal, when the relevant benedictions were pro-\nnounced (and when the wine, as Talmudic medicine has it, served as\nan “opener of the intestines”), after the meal (or even during it, if\none wished), and again after grace was said, when a cup, held in the\nright hand during the long prayer after a meal, was emptied, pre-\nceded by a blessing and followed by a special grace over wine. This\nsequence of drinks and thanks for the gift of wine, elaborated in the\nTalmud and codified by Maimonides, is still observed in traditional\nhouseholds, with the qualification that the lovely custom of holding\nsweet-smelling herbs in the left hand during the grace has fallen into\ndesuetude.® Formal dinners with wine served in the order described\nabove were also held after bloodletting or a visit to a public bath\n\nGoitein, S.

A letter accompanying the\ngift of “a little juglet of wine” from the court clerk Solomon, son of\nthe judge Elijah, whose family dabbled in the wine trade (see n. 37,\nbelow), illustrates the mores of the time. The recipient was the old\nphysician Rashid, who is described as the writer’s “father” and\nbenefactor. Rashid is five times implored to receive the insignificant\ngift and not to embarrass the sender by refusing or paying for it or\nby reciprocating with a return gift. It was a light wine, to be taken\nwith cooked (not roasted) meat.'® Moreover, the time of the pressing\nof new grapes was upon them, and Solomon himself did not drink\nwine “in these very hot days,” and so on.

The little the Geniza has to offer in these matters is therefore\ndoubly welcome.\n\nContainers and prices.—The container of wine most often men-\ntioned was the jarra, a jar (the English is derived from the Arabic),\nprobably with two handles like the Greek amphora.** A document\nfrom October 1099 about a complicated lawsuit mentions a payment\nof 9 dinars for ninety jars, corrected in a postscript to ninety-one,\nwhich makes it likely that 1 dinar was a standard price for ten\njarras.!* A detailed letter about the pressing of grapes and the\nmaking of wine, written at least a hundred years later, informs a\nrelative that for his 3 dinars thirty jars of wine were produced; since\nthe local supply of grapes was exhausted, his additional require-\nments would be satisfied elsewhere.'® In summer 1150, or slightly\nlater, a man inherited from his father, among other items, 1,937 jars\nof wine, which were auctioned, during at least four days, mostly in\nunits of 10, 20, 30, 50, 90, 100, 150 or 200 jars, occasionally also in\nsums other than tens, such as 15, 65, or 19, 89. The list of the buyers\nis quite intersting (see the note).'®\n\nInstead of the general word jarra, another term, clearly derived\nfrom the Greek, tamawiya, was frequently used as a standard term\nfor a wine container. This vessel must have had a special form, for\nempty clay tamawiyas, for instance, 350 costing 70 dirhems, which\nmakes 0.2 dirhem apiece, were stored in a cellar, or a quantity worth\n4 dirhems by a small dealer. Ten tamawiyas of wine—like ten\npounds of siltk—were traded as a unit. The court clerk Mevorakh b.\nNathan (active ca. 1150—1180) had seven tamawiyas filled with wine\nin the provincial town Minyat Zifta; through a friend he asks his\nbrother to let him have another three so that he may be able to sell his\nwine.'” Of particular interest is a document referring to spring 1149,\nthe beginning and the end of which are missing; it seems to repre-\nsent the dissolution of a partnership between a large number of\nmembers.

Is it not the variety of wines which makes them so\nattractive? The answer is that our texts speak about local wine mostly\nlaid in for yearly consumption and awaiting the pressing of fresh\ngrapes in the coming summer. The soil and climate of Egypt are not\nparticularly well suited for viniculture. But when the wine-loving\nGreeks, in the wake of Alexander’s victories, became the masters of\nEgypt for almost a thousand years, they made considerable efforts to\nexpand wine-growing in the country. As our documents show, these\nefforts were crowned with success, and even today, as I learned from\nthe late Professor Rudolf Mach, a connoisseur, Egyptian wine is not\nto be dismissed easily. There were, of course, good years and bad,\nand, as we shall see, even a small producer would be able to offer\ndifferent qualities. The deviation of about 20 percent, from the\naverage of 1 dinar for ten jarras or tamawiyas observed above,\nwould leave enough latitude for such differences. A glimpse from\nthe consumer’s side sheds additional light on this problem.**\n\nIn the month of Av (July 17—Aug. 15) 1140, two payments for\ngrapes, totaling 6 7/12 dinars, and one of 2 dinars for raisins were\nmade by Abii Zikri Kohen Sijilmasi, the representative of merchants\nin Fustat so ubiquitous in these volumes.*® In an account settled in\nJune 1134 for the preceding year, Abii Zikri had spent 5 1/24 dinars\nfor one purchase of grapes.** About eighty years earlier, when\nNahray b. Nissim, the Tunisian merchant resident in Egypt, was still\nvery active in Palestine and Lebanon, his agent in Jerusalem bought\nfor him grapes for 5 Nizariyya dinars (which were then regarded as\nhaving particularly good value).?® According to the data on the\npreceding pages, one could get fifty to sixty jars of wine for 5 or\n6 dinars spent on grapes, a reasonable quantity for the household of\na respectable merchant: a jar per week, with extras for holidays and\n\nGoitein, S.

Since Jews were\nsupposed to drink only wine produced, transported, and stored\nunder the supervision of reliable coreligionists, a ramified wire\ntrade was a necessity of life. A Jew selling 221 1/2 small jars of wine\nappears in an Antinoopolis papyrus of the year 542, more than a\nhundred years before the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs.*” Ancient\nArabic literature is full of stories of Christian and Jewish taverns.\nFour types of traders in wine are discernible in the Geniza: mer-\nchants investing in wine as in any other business venture; profes-\nsional nabbadhin, who, as usual, carried that commodity as both\nretailers and wholesalers; religious dignitaries, who could dabble in\nthis trade because they were naturally regarded as particularly reli-\nable by the scrupulous; and, finally, physicians, because wine was not\nonly delicious and nutritive but also much used in medical treat-\nment. In a treatise still extant, Moses Maimonides recommended the\ndrinking of wine to an Ayyubid ruler for the cure of melancholy,\nleaving it to him to follow medical advice or the commands of his\nreligion.”®\n\nWine cellars stocking two to three thousand jars seem to have\nbeen nothing exceptional, and quantities of two to two hundred and\nfifty jars changing hands are mentioned repeatedly.” A successful\nEgyptian doctor practicing in Seleucia (today Selefke), Asia Minor,\nboasted of possessing four hundred barrels, each containing ten\ntamayas (thus), which would make four thousand jars. But measure-\nments in Byzantium were probably different from those prevailing\nin Egypt.®® A retailer, who at the opening of the store had 650\ntamawiyas in his makhzan, sold quantities ranging from a quarter\njar (twice) to 110 jars.®\n\nI said that wine was traded in units of ten jars, probably the\nminimum on which a wholesaler or any passer of a toll station at the\nentrance to a city had to pay a tax.** The average price for this unit, I\nsurmised, was | dinar, and, for one jar 0.1 dinar, or about, 4 dir-\nhems. A bill of expenditure for a grand dinner, written on an Arabic\npapyrus of the ninth century, lists two items of wine, one costing\n4 1/2 dirhems and another 6 dirhems, probably two jars of different\nquality ® In a contract between two physicians, 91 + 9 = 100 jars of\n“good” lataf wine cost 657 1/2 cut-up dirhems which were the legal\ntender in Egypt around 1220.

The cellar of one such mer-\nchant was arranged in four rows, each containing 150—290 tama-\nwiyas, 17—29 lajiyds (see the note), and 5—40 “small ones.” In the\nTower, that is, a tower of the ruined Roman fortress, which was\npossessed by the Jewish community and converted into stores and\napartments, smaller quantities of the same three categories were\nkept.?® An inventory made on 5 Oct. 1230 by Solomon b. Elijah of\nthe quantities of wine kept in the underground storeroom of the\nfamily house for his father, the judge, his brother, the physician, and\nhimself, he notes, alongside tamawiyas (31—37 for each) a measure-\nment named “olive,” certainly a very small one. Most of the wines are\ndescribed as muwallad, crossbred, possibly meaning mixed with an\ninferior type of wine, and only a few (totaling ten) as khamn, real\nwine.®” About a hundred years earlier, Toviah b. Eli, who was in\ncharge of the Jewish community of Bilbays, sent to his cousin and\nbrother-in-law, the judge Nathan b. Solomon in Fustat, ten samples\nof two qualities of wine, of which he had made a total of one hundred\nand fifty jarras, asking him to offer them “to the best Jewish wine\nsellers.” He implores the judge in the most urgent terms to break the\nclay seal of a jar marked by a sign, and, if he liked “the smell,” that is\nthe bouquet, to use it.”* When the superintendent of “the small\nsynagogue in Alexandria” revoked the engagement of his daughter\nto a nephew, he had to return to the latter among other things sixty\njarras of wine, supplied by the prospective son-in-law as a partner-\nship planned. Dealings in comparatively small quantities of wine, we\nsee, were a favorite sideline for persons holding religious office.*\n\nRecipes for wine.—~Samuel Krauss describes thirty kinds of wine\nfound in Talmudic literature, which is, we remember, of an intrin-\nsically religious and juristic character.* Nothing of the kind can be\noffered from the Geniza, although most of its content is concerned\nwith daily life.

The mixture prepared was poured into a jarra of grape\nwine, the measurement of which was known to everyone, although it\nseems not yet to have been defined by modern research with cer-\ntainty.*® A real honey wine is described in the recipe translated\nbelow, which was written in Aden, South Arabia.

This was not an innovation of\nIslam. The Prophets of ancient Israel proclaimed “we shall not ride\non horses” and had the Messiah ride on an ass—protests against\nhuman vanity and haughtiness as demonstrated in the choice of\nmounts, always in the public eye like our cars. Naturally, only the\nhigher echelons of society could permit themselves luxurious ex-\nposure, often fraught with danger. Christians and Jews, as is known:\nfrom many stories, had to be particularly cautious not to arouse the\nenvy and anger of the majority population. Yet the example of the\nleading classes was seductive. Even within the narrow circle of the\nJewish community a person’s status was marked by the value of his\nriding beast. The gift of a mule with its harness from a Tunisian\nprincess’s own stable was no less a distinction for a Jewish court\npurveyor than the bestowal of a robe of honor. This passage from a\nletter to a brother carousing with an Arab chieftain, the brother of a\ngeneral who held sway over most of Lower Egypt, is a telling\nexample.\n\nThe least that the Jews and others say (under oath!) about you is that you\nearned on this journey a thousand dinars; not enough with this: one,\nby-named Abu 'I-Fadl of the companions of the Rayyis [. . .] al-Dawla® said to\nme yesterday night in the reception hall of the Rayyis and in the presence of\nguests: “Your brother has got from Fakhr al- ‘Arab® what is worth five\nhundred dinars, namely, a mule with its saddle worth two hundred dinars,\nand three hundred dinars in cash.™ That man added that he was in al-\nMabhalla and had seen all this with his own eyes.\n\nGod knows how I felt when I heard this.

They did not deal in animals, for their common busi-\nness is described as a shop, kanit, but they cherished their mounts as\nour contemporaries do their cars. “One-Eyed” was probably a riding\nass, destined to serve the writer after he had sold his mule, reason\nunknown.® Larger mansions would have one or even two stables, but\nwe rarely hear of them, for most of our documents deal with the\ntransfer of single houses or—even more frequently—parts of\nhouses. In any case, our letter reflects an environment of persons at\nease, not only because of the government connection but in view of\nthe price: for 20 dinars one could have a good maidservant—or ten\npounds of silk, with which one could start a business. The value of\nmost of the mounts referred to was far lower.”\n\nIn the letter summarized, the same expressions are used for the\nwell being of animals as for human beings.

The price range of donkeys is well illustrated in the\nletter of another physician, also met before: no one would choose to\nbuy those offered for 2 dinars or less; those costing 5—6 dinars were\nnot worth more than 4; therefore he refrained from buying any.*\nWhen the Keeper of the Sepulchers of the Patriarchs in Hebron,\nPalestine, complained that his son was robbed of his donkey worth\n6 dinars, while traveling to Ascalon, he probably exaggerated; the\ngist of the letter was a cry for help (late eleventh century).’* A\ndonkey purchased for 3 1/12 dinars by a troubled businessman,\nfrom whom we have many letters, was offered for sale unsaddled for\n2 dinars; its “outfit” was evaluated as worth 20 dirhems, or about\nhalf a dinar (May 1140).\"\n\nThus, a lower middle-class physician or merchant could have a\nmodest riding beast for about 4 dinars. If for any reason he did not\nkeep one, he at least kept in the house saddles and harness for both\nmule and donkey to be used when one bought or hired a mount for\ntravel. We find such equipment in the estate of a druggist (1143) and\nin that of a woman from Fustat (1083).'® An order for one, inserted\ninto a long business letter written by the prominent merchant\nBarhunb. Isaac Tahertl in al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, on 9 August\n1048, deserves attention. “Buy for me a Cairene saddle, a small one,\nfor a donkey, of excellent material; if used, I do not care; price\n1/2—2 dinars; also a rein of black leather with a heavy iron, for my\ndonkey has a strong head.” Obviously, Barhiin, who commuted\nbetween Egypt and Tunisia, kept a mount in Alexandria but or-\ndered its harness from Misr, the capital, probably the central market\nfor riding beasts (often imported from Nubia) and their equipment.\nBarhiin had to specify “donkey,” because a merchant of his status\nwas supposed to ride a mule.\"”\n\nRiding animals then, as now with cars, were lent to friends,\noccasionally even for extended trips. Such favors could lead to\nmishaps. One in which prices were involved is briefly reported: a\ndonkey whose proprietor claimed it cost him 5 dinars was lent to a\nfriend for a trip to Malij; on the way the donkey was lost and its rider\ndied, but not before having asserted that it was worth only 2 di-\nnars—a complicated case indeed.'®\n\nRenting mounts.—People who had neither money nor friends who\npossessed animals rented them.

Although Jewish couriers were com-\nparatively plentiful, Jewish muleteers and donkey drivers were not,\nor cannot be identified as Jews, because such persons are usually\nreferred to with names that were common to Jews and Muslims.**\nThe practice seems to have been that one traveled only a compara-\ntively short distance with the mukari(s) (probably until one stayed\novernight), and then hired new ones. Thus a friend is warned:\n“When you arrive in Malij, you must hire mounts, for our animals\nare on the spring pastures.” The company obviously had expected\nto use their friends’ donkeys.* A scholarly person from Alexandria\nwho had tried in vain to find employment in the capital asks Aba\nNasr, possibly the famous one, the Tustari, for 3 dirhems to hire a\nriding beast and try his luck in one of the congregations of the Rif.\nAlthough 3 dirhems was hardly a negligible sum, our scholar would\nnot get very far with such a fare. But he could be sure that any\ncommunity that did not wish to make use of his talents would be glad\nto get rid of him by paying for the continuation of his journey.**\n\nTraveling in stages had another purpose. As long as the aim was\nto cover a certain distance as quickly and conveniently as possible,\nthe main requirement was a strong and steady animal, whatever its\nlooks. When approaching his destination, however, one wished “to\nenter the city” on a fine mount in an equally ornate harness. In a\nstrikingly calligraphic Hebrew letter with wide space between the\nlines (as in the caliphal chancelleries) a VIP informs Sahlan b. Abra-\nham, the head of the Iragian congregation in Fustat, that he had\narrived safely in Minyat al-Qa’id via Sahrajt, and sends him respect-\nful greetings. In a one-line marginal note, written in Arabic, he\npolitely suggests that Sahlan’s messenger bring back a saddled\nmount “so that entrance could be made while riding on it.”*\n\nA person of standing, such as a government official of rank, a\nrenowned physician, or prosperous merchant, would normally\nleave his house mounted. Since Jews were not permitted to ride on\nSaturday, noble families tried to live near the synagogue. When\nCairo was founded and a Jewish house of worship was erected in it,\nthree court physicians of the Fatimid caliphs had their houses just\naround it.?* This complaint from the pen of a Hebrew poet to his\nmaecenas is particularly illustrative: “At midnight you came to me\non foot asking me to compose a letter of condolence and to adorn it\nwith verses. You found me and I wrote. And I composed booklets of\ndirges to be recited by the community each day of the period of\nmourning.” The maecenas was in such a hurry that he did not take\nthe time to have his mount saddled, which shows that the distance\nbetween his house and the dwelling of the poet was short.

A mule worth\n20 dinars symbolized high status. A mule with its harness costing ten\ntimes that much was regarded as ostentatious affluence and danger-\nous for a non-Muslim.

Estates, at least those registered\nby clerks of the rabbinical court of Fustat, rarely surpassed a thou-\nsand dinars in cash and promissory notes.*®\n\nThe public chest was even more restricted in means than private\ncoffers. The yearly revenue from twenty-five properties—pious\nfoundations belonging, completely or partly, to the rabbinical com-\nmunity of Fustat—amounted in 1164 to 3,683 dirhems. At that time\nthe community possessed about sixty such houses. From this and\nother data has been calculated an average yearly income from pious\nfoundations of 12,000 dirhems, or about 300 dinars.?® Some of\nthose buildings were out of repair and had probably been donated\nby their proprietors when moving to (New) Cairo. But others were\nwell kept, as their long life, testified by the Geniza, proves,®® and a\nyearly income of 5 dinars from a modest house was normal for the\npeople described in these pages.*\n\nAnother characteristic of the material well being of Geniza society\nwas its relative uniformity.

At the same time distinct strata of prosperity were\nclearly discernible. Both phenomena can best be studied by a perusal\nof documents on real estate transactions and on the conclusion of\nmarriages. One could buy a complete house for 20 dinars, but also\nbuild one costing 600 dinars. In between, naturally, values of prop-\nerties varied widely, but seven clearly distinct groups stand out, and\nwithin each group a certain standardization of prices seems to have\nbeen achieved.* For instance, in App. A, Group III (houses worth\n50—80 dinars), five out of eighteen properties were worth 50 dinars\n(including one of 52 dinars), and seven, 60 (one 58); in Group IV\n(90— 140 dinars) five out of thirteen were around 100 dinars, three,\n120, and another three, 140 dinars.\n\nLess than one-half of the Jewish community of Fustat can have\npossessed houses.* But almost everyone married. Consequently,\nthe gradation in value of marriage gifts and dowries from the poor\nto the well-to-do was far narrower than that of the prices of real\nestate. Yet, here too, seven distinct groups are discernible, and\nstandardization was very pronounced.* The groups of values of\nhouses do not coincide at all with those of the economics of mar-\nriage. But the interplay of a high degree of uniformity with marked\nstratification was operative in both fields.\n\nAdd to these a third element: the closeness of living quarters,\ncaused perhaps in part by progressive impoverishment and the\navailability of inexpensive housing owing to the exodus to Cairo, a\nprocess probably more marked in the Muslim population than in the\nJewish. Parts of, or shares in, houses changed hands more often than\ncomplete buildings. Taking the three middle groups of Appen-\ndix A, we find being sold in Group III three eighths, one sixth, five\nfourths, two halves, and only one complete house; three houses\nserved as collateral or security, that is, remained in the hands of their\nproprietors. In Group 1V, only two complete houses were sold, as\nagainst one sixth, five fourths, and two halves; in Group V there was\nnot a single case of an entire property purchased (except one in\nByzantium). In the rare instances when a relative bought part of a\nhouse from another, he probably intended to round up an estate\nthat had become split in the process of inheritance. Otherwise,\nshares were acquired either because the buyer wished to live there\nhimself or to derive income by leasing. Whether as tenants or as\nproprietors of shares, the inhabitants lived close together and had to\ntake care of many common concerns: the well providing water for\nwashing and cleaning, the drainpipes needing constant attention,\n\nGoitein, S.

All these and various other aspects of life in a condo-\nminium are touched upon in the Geniza and we get a sense of how\nthat way of life must have affected those who were exposed to it.\n\nYet, while weighing the Geniza evidence we must always consider\nthe circumstances under which it came into being. Partners fre-\nquently had occasion to go to court, not only to settle a squabble but\nalso simply to establish their individual rights. Siblings and relatives\nin general were often partners in a house, but the honor of the\nfamily required that it conceal its affairs from the public eye as much\nas possible. The family mansion was still a strong institution in\nGeniza times, and, in view of the durability of buildings, lasted for\ngenerations. We frequently read about it, especially in engagement\nand marriage contracts. But its importance reached far beyond what\nwas confided to writing. The information gleaned from the Geniza\nis a starting point; we must gauge its implications. Only in excep-\ntional cases have we the good luck to find a number of documents\nreferring to the same case, thus permitting us to put together a full\nstory. In App. D, Doc. II, we read about Sitt al-Khassa who received\nfive out of twenty-four shares—approximately a quarter—of the\nhouse of her grandfather and one-half of that of her father, both\nlong dead at the time of her engagement in 1146. The grandfather,\nJoseph Lebdi, a native of Tunisia, had purchased that “large” house\nin 1102 for the exceptionally high price of 500 dinars, when he, a\nseasoned India trader, preferred to settle in the capital of Egypt. He\nleft the main part of that house (19/24 or approximately three-\nquarters) to his daughter, certainly because his son, as our document\nshows, had already acquired a domicile for himself. When this girl\n(Sitt al-Khagsa’s aunt), after a romantic interlude, finally married,\nshe brought that big chunk of a large house to her husband, whom\nwe therefore find in our document as partner of Sitt al-Khassa. We\nsee that old Joseph Lebdi provided well for his progeny when he\ngained possession of that expensive mansion.*\n\nThe moving story of a brother who gave his sister at her marriage\nhalf a large house and half a small one confronting it and, four years\nlater, on his deathbed, the other two halves, can be reconstructed\nonly because three documents could be identified as belonging\ntogether. According to Jewish law the son was heir to the entire\nproperty of his father, but he was expected to enable his sister to\nfound a family with the aid of the estate he had received.*®\n\nBesides those who had work (or had means enough not to need\n\nGoitein, S.

A good illustration of this situation is found in Group V,\nthe entry dated 1246, where out of 24 shares of a property two were\nsold for 27 d. on 16 April 1246, whereas one share was sold for 15 d.\nthree montbhs later, on 29 July 1246. The total value of that com-\npound, which consisted of two houses, was thus approximately\n324-360 d.\n\nSimilarly, the sum against which a house was given as collateral\nwas very probably smaller than the price of that house. In excep-\ntional cases, the opposite might have been the case, namely, when\nthe debtor did not possess anything else except the mortgaged\nproperty (see Group I, the entry dated ca. 1220).\n\n(R) indicates that the house was situated in a residential quarter.\nThis is assumed where either a detailed description of the bounda-\nries shows that a house was surrounded by private homes or where\nthe neighborhood is known as residential from fairly contemporary\ndocuments. (B) stands for bazaar. Business and/or industrial areas\nare assumed when a house is adjacent to one or several bazaars. In\nmost cases the relevant data are either absent, or lost, or not suffi-\nciently evident.\n\nAttention is drawn to the tables and discussion of the prices of\nhouses in Fatimid and Ayyubid times presented by Ashtor, Prix, pp.\n183—190. This Appendix contains a number of Geniza items not\nlisted by Ashtor, and the reader will occasionally discover some\ndiscrepancies between the two tables. To discuss these minutiae\nwould lead too far afield and would not change essentially the\n\nGoitein, S. D.

The gifts were made for\nmaintenance of the synagogues, their lighting for study at night, for\nweekly distributions of bread to the needy, and for other religious or\ncharitable objects. In practice, most of the premises belonging to the\ncommunal chest were inhabited by poor people. In normal times,\nthe payments of rent were comparatively regular. Even beggars\nwere advised: “Just as you beg for your food, beg for your rent.” One\naccount is particularly impressive where, in the course of twenty-one\nconsecutive months, in nineteen, 3 dirhems were paid, inone, 2 1/2,\nand in another, 2; the tenant, as the sums show, must have been a\nneedy person (ENA 1822 A, f. 68v, Med. Soc., 11, 432, sec. 161; Gil,\nFoundations, p. 476, does not have the verso). Consequently, the\nmassive testimony of the Geniza accounts from the eleventh through\nthe thirteenth century is an important source for the study of hous-\ning, especially of the poorer sections of the population. The conclu-\nstons drawn from the analysis of seven accounts undertaken in this\nappendix in comparison with other material on the subject are\nsummarized in A, 3, above.\n\nThe accounts analyzed are described in Med. Soc., 11, App. A, and\nprinted with a translation and important comments in Gil, Founda-\ntions. They are referred to here according to their numbers in Med.\nSoc., 11, and in Gil's book, for example, A 6 = Med.

        "text": "Appendix C\n\nFurnishings\n\nThe Geniza documents have several terms for furnishings in the\nwidest sense of the word, comprising everything movable in the\nhouse. In the trousseau lists the words used mostly referred to\n(travel) outfit or equipment (jahdz, rahl, shuwar, shira) (see Med. Soc.,\n111, 124). The most general term for furnishings was qumdsh, house-\nhold effects (from gamash, to collect), as in TS NS J 228 (Malij, 1134):\n“Estimate of the qumash of Lady Splendor”; or TS NS J 231 (Fustat,\n1225): “We were present in the place where the qumash jihaz, the\nhousehold effects forming the outfit of the virgin Noble, were as-\nsembled for evaluation.” But when a newlywed asks her mother to\nsend her her qumish (ENA NS 22, f. 20v, 1. 6), the context shows\nthat only the copper vessels were intended, and in the trousseau list\nTS K 25, f. 269 (early thirteenth century) qumash is the specific\nname of the Clothing section, coming, as usual, between Jewelry and\nBedding. Such shifting and narrowing of terms is a common occur-\nrence in human speech in general. See now N.A. Stillman,\n“Kumdsh,” E1?, V, 373-374.\n\nWhen a household was dissolved, all that was found in it was\ncomprised under the term gashsha (from gashsh, also meaning to\ncollect, to gather). While settling the estate of his wife, which went to\nhis son, Meir b. al-Hamadani, the correspondent of Moses Mai-\nmonides (Med. Soc., 11, 248, 577 n. 37) writes to the judge Elijah b.\nZechariah: “From the entire qashsha nothing should remain, except\nthree pairs of round cushions, the most precious among them, two\nlong leather cushions, also the finest ones, the woolen martaba, the\nsilk robe, the chandelier, and the silver scales, please may your\nhonor send all these to your servant, my son Miisa [Moses]. All the\nrest should be sold.” Immediately three other items were added, an\nimplement for making fire (zinad), a knife for cutting meat (satur),\nand a mirror.

But qashsha was\nused also in a narrow sense, for instance, “articles of personal use” as\nin the will Bodl. MS Heb. b 13, (Cat. 2834, no. 27) f. 46, 1. 25, or\neven one’s old clothing as in TS 13 J 25, . 9, 1. 18—19, Nahray 181\n(in the plural: gishash). Hence the dealers in secondhand objects,\nwho occupied a street in the bazaar of Fustat, were called gashsh, or\nthe like (see Med. Soc., 1, 437, bottom, n. 5).\n\nThus one sees that a comprehensive term for furnishings was in\nliving use when it was needed for legal purposes, in particular, when\nthe furnishings were part of either the bride’s trousseau, before she\nmoved to her husband’s house, or the estate of a deceased person,\nwhen it had to be decided how to dispose of them.\n\nIn the following, wherever feasible, the class to which the pro-\nprietors of a piece of furnishing belonged is noted. These abbrevia-\ntions are used:\n\nLMC Lower middle class\nUMC Upper middle class\nVMod. In very modest circumstances\n\nWith a few exceptions the classification adopted in Med. Soc., 111,\n418-419, is followed.\n\nIf not otherwise stated, the prices are in dinars, the place is Fustat\nor unknown, and Rami means Byzantine.\n\n1. Seating and bedding: terminology.—Sitting and sleeping facili-\nties, together with draperies and carpets, usually formed the third\npart of a trousseau list, preceded by jewelry and clothing. Occasion-\nally the group had a name (either in a superscription or in the\nsummary of its total value): “What is spread out and what is hung\nup,” al-busut wal-taaliq (TS J 1, f. 29, col. 111, 1. 24 [ca. 1140]), or, in\ninverted order, “al-ta‘liq[!] wal-busut” (TS 24.1 [1082]).\n\nWhen summarized separately, sitting and sleeping facilities were\ndescribed as busut (TS K 15, f. 65, col. IV, ll. 4—11 [no date]), or\nfurush (Firkovitch II, 1700, f. 24 b, 1. 1 [1156]; both written by the\nsame scribe, Mevorakh b. Nathan). The two words are derived from\nsimilar but slightly different roots, the first meaning “spreading\nout,” the latter, “laying out on the ground.” When the two are used\ntogether, furush refers more to bedding and busut to sitting facilities,\nas in the will Bodl. MS Heb. b 13, (Cat. 2834, no. 27), f. 46, 1. 25.

A\nperson could own one for 60 dinars and another one for 5, and a\nDabiqi linen martaba consisting of three sections could be had for 25\ndinars or for 2. The wide diversity is to be explained by the fact that\nmany pieces were much used heirlooms or secondhand, and were\ndestined for different purposes (reception hall, bedroom). This\ndiversity would have been even more pronounced had the list not\nbeen confined to items consisting of several sections and a few\nhigh-priced martabas.\n\nOn the other hand the standardization of the fabrics used for\nmartabas is remarkable.

It is likely that most of the unspecified ones came from\nthe same source. I translate here Riami as Byzantine (and not\nChristian Europe), because in the trousseau lists Rami is often\nmentioned together, and opposed to, Siqilli, Sicilian, the island from\nwhich Western textiles were imported. “The rich bride” (TS J 1,\nf. 29) had, in addition to martabas made of Rimi brocade, two of\nJaza'iri—which should not be translated as “Algerian” (the regular\n\nGoitein, S.

A Jaza'iri back on a brocade martaba is noted in a marriage\ncontract from the same period (TS K 15, f. 65, col. IV, 1. 5), and a\ntarraha daybed made from this material is noted half a century\nearlier (ENA 2747, £. 1, . 6). Maghrebi, that is Tunisian, fabric, used\nexceptionally for a martaba of five sections (see TS 10 J 21, f. 4 b,\n1. 15) probably was also brocade; Maghrebi curtains, bedspreads,\nand pillows made of brocade are mentioned in several Geniza\ndocuments.\n\nTabari(stan) silk.—This renowned textile (see A, 4, n. 2, above) is\nalways described as either genuine or imitation. Of twenty-five\nsamples, eleven martabas were made of genuine Tabaristins, and\nfourteen were imitated locally, five in Ramle: TS 12.12 (ca. 1020);\nTS 20.47v (long before 1080); Bodl. a 3 (2873), f. 43 (1059, two such\nmartabas); TS NS ] 390 (late eleventh or early twelfth century). In\nMed. Soc., 1, 50, n. 53, I left it open whether Ramle, Palestine, or a\nplace of the same name in Egypt was meant. I have not found a\nsingle reference to the latter in the Geniza; during the eleventh\ncentury, however, the former appears in it as a great center of\ninternational trade. Many emigrants from Iran and Iraq settled,\ntemporarily or permanently, in Ramle, Palestine, including Ibn\nKillis, later vizier of the first Fatimid caliph of Egypt. It is reasonable\nto assurme that some of those Easterners developed an industry there\nwith which they had been familiar in their countries of origin. When\nwe find a two-section Tabari martaba (see listing above) exported\nfrom Ascalon, the port of Ramle, it is reasonable to conclude that it\nwas manufactured in the latter city. For the Hariini Tabari made in\nRamle see p. 306, below.\n\nThis heavy silk fabric was also used for the alternatives of the\nmartaba, the majlis-seat and the tarraha daybed (see above, A, 4,\nnn. 3—5, 8), and for parts of the bedding, namely, the barda‘a, the\npad laid on top of the mattress, and the matrah (see ibid., n. 7). If my\nmemory does not fail me, I have never come across a firash, the basic\nequipment of bedding, which may be tentatively translated as mat-\ntress, made of Tabaristan or its imitations.\n\nTabaris were so popular that in the earlier half of the Geniza\nperiod brides brought into the marriage a bayt Tabari, literally, a\nTabari-house, meaning a trunk filled with that costly material (ENA\nNS 3, f. 24, 1. 19; see Friedman, Marriage, no. 1, 1. 26, where the\nsources about these occurrences are collected). I suspect this usage is\npre-Islamic, for bayt, in the meaning of container, is Aramaic rather\nthan Arabic. The semi-independent rulers of Tabaristan sent such\n\nGoitein, S. D.

A Karaite bride in modest circumstances, who\nmarried in Jerusalem in Jan. 1028, had, besides a Tabari martaba, a\nBuzyén one, presumably named after Buzyin, a place near Herit,\nAfghanistan (Persian long 4 is pronounced o) (ULC Add. 3430; see\nApp. D, Doc. I, below). Buzyin brocade was highly valued in early\nIslamic times; its colors and patterns are described in al-Jahiz’s\ntreatise on international trade (see Serjeant, Islamic Textiles, 1516,\np- 66). In an ancient Geniza marriage contract (TS 24.30, ed.\nFriedman, Marriage, no. 5, 1. 28) a bride has a bayt Fizyon\n(= Buzyon) together with a bayt Tabari, a container for each of\nthese precious fabrics. But in the marriage contract of Karima b.\n‘Ammair (= al-Wuhsha; see Med. Soc, 111, 346 —352) written around\n1090, a Buzydn tarriha with its two cushions cost only 2 dinars\n(ENA 2727, f. 8, 1. 18). They had probably been in use for several\ngenerations. The poor bride in TS NS J 461, 1.16, ENA 2747, f. 1,\n1. 6 (Med. Soc. I1I, 396, no. 36) had a2 Buzyon. (Originally, I derived\nFizyon from Greek fasian(os), pheasant, designating a textile with\nfigures of brilliantly colored pheasants; but because of the 6 pro-\nnunciation and the wide use of Buzyon-Fizyon in early Islamic times\nI prefer the derivation from an Iranian place. The fact that a Rami\nBuzy6n is mentioned once does not prove Byzantine origin. Just as\none had Tabari Ramli, that is, Tabaristan imitated in Ramle, one\nhad Buzyon imitated by the Ram.

Wherever the Dabiqi is described as white, the divan it\ncovers was probably intended predominantly for nightly rest.\n\nSilk martabas are rarely noted. Silk (harir) was manufactured in\nthose days almost everywhere, but good silk normally came to Egypt\nfrom Spain or Sicily (see Med. Soc., I, 102—104). The siglaton, a heavy\ndamask renowned during the Middle Ages in Europe under this\nname as in the Near East (see Goitein, Letters, p. 77), occurs as a\nmartaba cover only in the trousseau of “the rich bride” (TS ]I,\n£. 29, col. 111, 1. 21) and perhaps once or twice as a decoration of a\nmartaba made of another material.\n\nWool is virtually absent.

Armenian martabas were bought in Fustat and sold\nin Tinnis on the Mediterrancan coast by a merchant traveling to\nAscalon and Jerusalem around 1060 (TS 10 J 16, f. 10, 1. 17, Nahray\n156).\n\nAs in our own times, textiles and other manufactured goods\ncould have trade names. The Dabiqi linen of Hafizi make was used\nnot only for martabas but also for a variety of clothing. It is probably\nnamed after the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz (1131—-1149) (see B, n.\n125). To the best of my knowledge, none of the Geniza documents\nmentioning it precedes his reign. The Baha'T brocade martaba of\n“the rich bride” was produced in a workshop of a Mr. Baha’,\nSplendor. Several men with this name or title appear in our docu-\nments. In a report by Nahray b. Nissim to Tyre, Lebanon, about\nprices in the capital of Egypt, the Hariini Tabari martabas cost\nabout 2 dinars per piece (JNUL2,1. 11, ed. E. Strauss, Zion, 7 [1952],\n152 [for “I-’bry \"l-mk’th read al-Tabari al-maratib]). Harini, derived\nfrom Aaron, means Kohen, or Mr. Cohen, in Arabic. The recipient\nof this letter was on his way back from Tyre to Ramle, Palestine, and\nthe price list was sent to him from Egypt to instruct him on how to-\nbuy. Thus Mr. Cohen in Ramle was the, or one of the manufacturers\nof the Ramle Tabarl. Since he is called in a letter exchanged between\ntwo Jews, Harani and not Kohen, it is evident that his Tabari was\nsold in the bazaar of Old Cairo under that Arabic trade name.\n\n3. Cushions and pillows as comfort and decor.—The materials for\nthese furnishings were to a certain extent the same as those used for\ndivans and daybeds. But two fabrics were used exclusively or pre-\ndominantly for cushions. The first and most precious one was an\nembroidered, originally Iranian material named sisanjird. Opinion\nwas divided whether the first part of this word was derived from\nstisan, lily, that flower originally forming the main theme of decora-\ntion, or suzan, needle, describing the textile as a piece of artistic\ntapestry. In all the Geniza documents I have seen the word is invari-\nably spelled with s, not with z. Ernst Herzteld (Geschichte der Siadt\nSamarra, pp. 223—224, with bibliographic notes on the subject)\nasserts that the material is named after a town (Shushankird), as are\nso many other Iranian textiles. Figures of birds are the only embroi-\nderies of siisanjird noted in the Geniza (see A, 4, n. 32). Sisanjird\ncould be white and decorated with ornamental stripes (see bid.,\nn. 28).\n\nThe other favorite precious textile used for cushions was sharb, a\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Both sisanjird and Tinnis sharb were\npopular throughout the “classical” Geniza period.\n\nIn the first half of the eleventh century it seems to have been\ncustomary not to indicate the color of the cushions, and frequently\nto list only their number: six (TS 12.167, poor, 1027/8), seven (Bodl.\nMS Heb. a 2 [Cat. 2805], f. 4, poor, 1029), eight (TS 12.690, 1. 4,\nscribe Japheth b.

Later, the clerks became more\nspecific, probably in order to keep the dowry separate from mate-\nrials acquired by the husband.\n\nAn average of four or five pairs of living-room cushions seems to\nhave been standard for a middle-class bridal outfit. The number of\nover forty cushions noted in ENA NS 3, f. 24, L. 17, is a special case.\nThat girl brought in also a bridal canopy worth 150 dinars and a\nbridegroom's ceremonial seat (takht) worth 50 dinars (Il. 17 and 20),\ntwo items, as the editor rightly observes, not found elsewhere.\nClearly, that bride’s late father had been a caterer who provided, for\na compensation, the furnishings required at a wedding: a canopy for\nthe bride, a ceremonial seat for the groom, and partly precious\n(fifteen for 100 d.), partly regular (eighteen for 20 d.) cushions. Now\nthat the father was dead, that business equipment was part of her\ntrousseau. The commercial or gratuitous provision of jewelry and\nattire for weddings is recorded for pre-Islamic Mecca and is still\nhabitual in Arabia. The lending of furnishing requirements for that\npurpose is to be understood in the same way. Cf. p. 122, above,\nwhere a woman is requested to lend precious hangings for a festive\noccasion.\n\n4.

The well-to-do girl brought\nin with her, as usual, one maidservant, a confidante from her\nmother’s home, who would help her to overcome the difficulties\nawaiting her in a strange household dominated by her mother- and\nsisters-in-law. The wealthy bride possessed a staff of two maids and\ntwo personal attendants. Her dowry included a library worth 250\ndinars—a sum on which a modest family could live for ten years. She\nwas probably the daughter of a rich physician who had recently died\n(for who would part with his library during his lifetime?), and about\nto marry another physician who was avid to have the books. Collec-\ntions of books left by physicians were the most valuable ones re-\ncorded in the Geniza. The average price of a book in a physician’s\nlibrary sold publicly on two consecutive Tuesdays in November\n1190 was approximately 1/4 dinar. Thus, this bride’s library might\nhave contained about a thousand manuscripts.®\n\nThe really wealthy Jews are scarcely represented in the Geniza.\nMost of them lived in (New) Cairo, and the Geniza synagogue was in\nFustat. Moreover, the higher the status of a family, the more it tried\nto conceal evidence of its riches—too many rapacious government\nmen watched out for easy prey. Under these circumstances the list of\nthe “rich bride’s” trousseau (probably discarded in the Geniza by\nchance because it had been replaced by a revised copy) is particularly\nwelcome.\n\nDocument I differs from Documents IT and III by its place and\ntime, being written in Jerusalem 1028, whereas the other two were\nproduced in the capital of Egypt around the middle of the twelfth\ncentury. Document I is distinguished also by the fact that it is a\nKaraite document, whereas all the other ketubbas translated here\noriginated in the Rabbanite community, the main bulk of the Jewish\npopulation.\n\nThe Karaite ketubba differs widely from the Rabbanite. It was\ncreated during the “bourgeois revolution” of the early centuries of\nIslam and was, therefore, far more refined, expressive, and out-\nspoken about the relations between husband and wife than the rigid\nRabbanite ketubba, a remnant from antiquity. It was written in\nHebrew, a language that could easily be handled, whereas Aramaic,\n\nGoitein, S. D.

I translate the document in full because I believe that\nit reflects the attitude toward marriage in Geniza times in general\nand not solely with respect to the Karaite denomination.\n\nDocuments IV and V, dated 1146 and 1156, were selected be-\ncause they list the trousseaus of two sisters, leading to the assump-\ntion that they were more or less identical. They were, but not to the\nextent one would expect. This diversity reflects the general truth\nthat each ketubba in the Geniza was unique and depended on the\nspecial circumstances in which the two families and the couple itself\nfound themselves at the time of the engagement and marriage. Yet,\nthese same documents, and, indeed, the trousseau lists from Fatimid\nand early Ayyubid times in general, prove that there were certain\nstandards of clothing and other items for each layer of society. When\nthe outfit of a bride fell considerably short in one respect, but\nexceeded her status in another, special reasons (often, but not\nalways, easy to guess) must have prevailed.\n\nTo give just one, but very telling, example: In the often-discussed\nketubba of Sahlan b. Abraham, the paytan (writer of synagogal\npoetry) and leader of the Babylonian congregation of Fustat, the\nbride brings in clothing worth only 70 dinars, but furnishings and\nhousewares worth 120 dinars (80 + 40 [see Med. Soc., 111, 378,\nsec. 36]). This utterly exceptional imbalance of the dowry may be\nexplained as follows.* The bridegroom already bore all the titles a\nspiritual and communal leader could obtain in those days: havér of\nthe Palestinian, the allif of Hay Gaon’s Babylonian yeshiva, segan\nLeader—probably of the other Babylonian yeshiva, hemdat, Delight,\nof the Nest'ut, the family of the Exilarch. Thus he must have been\nwell advanced in age, and this marriage was not his first.> The\nrepudiated wife had taken with her the furnishings noted in her\nketubba. Consequently, while discussing with his future in-laws the\nitems of the dowry, Sahlin probably emphasized Bedding and\nCopper; for clothing, he himself would provide in due course, as\npromised in the ketubba. Naturally this is nothing but an educated\nguess. But those figures in the marriage contracts were of vital\nsignificance for the parties concerned, and we must try to under-\nstand them.\n\nTo repeat, the selection of trousseau lists and cognate documents\ntranslated and discussed is confined to the Fatimid and ecarly\nAyyubid periods. By the beginning of the thirteenth century a\ncomplete change in the nomenclature, and presumably also the look\nof clothing, occurred, no doubt under the influence of the Turkish\n\nGoitein, S. D.

Another change was the reduc-\ntion or complete disappearance of furnishings and housewares\nfrom the outfit of a bride.® Upper-class trousseau lists are almost\nabsent from the Geniza after 1200.” This probably was a result of the\ncatastrophic plague and famine of 1201 —1202 which decimated the\nsize of the population and depleted its resources, as well as of the\naccelerated exodus from Fustat to Cairo, a migration movement\ninitiated long before by the upper class. Finally, Muslim bigotry,\nwhich reached its culmination in Mamluk times (1250—1517), had\nin the later Ayyubid period already begun to affect all aspects of life,\nincluding the attitude toward clothing of non-Muslims.\n\nDocuments II-V were all written during the middle of the\ntwelfth century when the Jewish community was led by two high-\nstanding court physicians, Abi Mansir Samuel b. Hananya (1140—\n1159) and his successor Hibat Allah Nethanel b. Moses ha-Levi, both\nknown also from Arabic sources.® Although this period has been\ndescribed (because of its incredible court intrigues and the heinous\nmurders connected with them) as “one of the darkest chapters of\nEgyptian history,” it is documented in the Geniza by many items\nthat seem to show the Jewish community in an orderly and compara-\ntively prosperous state.'® The massive documentation in four de-\ntailed trousseau lists from this period provides us with a realistic\nnotion of the wardrobe of a Jewish woman in twelfth-century Egypt\nand the interior of her house.\n\nI had an additional reason for selecting documents I1-V. Any\nevaluation of a bride’s trousseau must start with a consideration of\nwhether the prices listed are real or inflated in honor of the young\ncouple and their families. The remark in Doc. II, fol. 47v,1. 1112,\n“a dinar is worth a dinar, real value, not doubled,” and a similar\nstatement in Doc. V, fol. 25 a, 1. 18 assure us that we are dealing here\nwith the real value of the outfit. Doc. II was written by judge Nathan\nb. Samuel he-havér, Doc. V by his son Mevorakh. Both seem to have\nadhered to the rule of giving the real estimates—unless expressly\nstated otherwise.!* Doc. III was also written by Nathan b. Samuel;\nthe proviso “a dinar is a dinar,” if made at all, was included in the\nmarriage contract, which we do not possess. Doc. IV, in which the\nelder of two sisters receives her trousseau back after she was\nwidowed, is signed by Nathan b. Samuel and, I believe, also written\nby hirm, albeit in a more cursive script than the estimates. Since the\npurpose of the court record was to show that the trousseau had been\nreturned in full, no prices are noted. According to all we know from\ncontemporary documents the prices in the Karaite ketubba from the\nyear 1028 (Doc. I) were real.\n\nGoitein, S. D.

At the time of our document\nhe was already dead, and since Sitt al-Hasab’s (as far as we know,\nfirst) marriage seemingly was of short duration, he had probably not\nwitnessed her wedding.

Consequently, we must concede\nthat we do not yet know for sure whether our document of 1146\nconcerns a widow or a divorcée. The duration of the marriage\nreflected in our document must have been short, for the numerous\nitems of clothing were returned without exception; of the jewelry\nSitt al-Hasab had only exchanged a ring for a pair of pins and givena\npair of bracelets as a collateral; and of furnishings some items had\nbeen removed “to them,” that is, to her paternal family, to which she\nprobably had moved.

FROM THE INVENTORIES\nOF THE ESTATES OF MEN\n\nNothing found in the Geniza with regard to the wardrobes of\nmen compares with trousseau lists. Business and private letters\ncontain much information concerning the fabrics, materials, and\nmarket value of garments, but they do not tell us what constituted\nthe sartorial equipment of a male individual. We are better off with\nwills or official statements about burial attire. The kafan, or shrouds,\nas this attire was called, was of very deep concern; it was to be as\nperfect as possible, as sumptuous or modest as feasible, depending\non the religious mood and the means of the person concerned.\nExamples for modest male “shrouds” were provided in B, pp. 188—\n189 above. There even the will of a pious man of limited means\nforesaw five covers of the entire body as the limit to which restraint\ncould go.\n\nInventories of the estates of men should yield more information\nabout the subject. Unfortunately only a few of them deal with\nclothing, except in the cases of travelers overtaken by death, which\nare, of course, not representative. Houses, or parts of them, given by\nparents to children had to be registered, like all transfers of real\nestate.'®® But the receipt by gift or inheritance of movables such as\nclothing was normally done by the mutual understanding of the\nrelatives concerned. Whatever could be achieved without attracting\nthe attention of the watchful eyes of the authorities was done with-\nout the writing of documents, which had to be witnessed by at least\ntwo persons.

This office can be rightly described as\ncorresponding to that of the Muslim Grand Mufti.**\n\nIn our case there was indeed some reason for doubt. The seven-\nteenth of the month of Nisan, on which our document was written, is\none of the wastaniyyat, or middle days, between the first and the\nconcluding days of the Passover holidays. The Geniza contains\nmuch material illustrating the question whether business should be\nconducted and documents written on these days. The answer was\ngenerally in the affirmative, although some misgivings about this\npermissiveness were expressed.?” In order to be on the safe side, the\njudges asked Maimonides, who ordered the action because of the\nurgency of the matter. The brother of the deceased had already\ntransferred a part of the latter’s housewares to his place. If this went\non, they could easily be mixed up with and disappear in the brother’s\nown belongings.2**\n\nAs often happened, our document is preserved in two different\ncollections: the University Collection of Geniza manuscripts, ac-\nquired by the Cambridge University Library by purchase or gift,and\nthe Taylor-Schechter Collection, brought to England by Solomon\nSchechter in 1898.

But southern Italy (Amalfi, Salerno,\nBari) and Greece (Thebes, Salonika) belonged to the Geniza world.\n\n3A single Geniza document (BM Or 5544) induced Norman Golb to write his\nmassive book History and Culture of the Jews of Rouen in the Middle Ages (Tel Aviv, 1976;\nin Heb.

In\nIraq-Mesopotamia, besides larger cities, such as Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, and Wasit,\nmany smaller places, such as ‘Aqul (near Baghdad), Hit, Irbil, Nahrawin, Raqqa,\nSariij, and ‘Ukbara, appear in family names.\n\n3The towns of the India route will be considered in the India Book (see Med.

        "text": "ix,A, 1 Notes: The City 357\n\n1¢Arabic én'n(k) may be pronounced in different ways. I take it as bunana, pl.\nbunan, beautiful garden, an ancient Arabic name (see Werner Caskel, Gamharat\nal-Nasab [Leiden, 1966, 11, 229). For Gardens, in the plural, as a female name,\ncompare TS Arabic Box 18(1), f. 130y, 1. 15, and Bodl. MS Heb, f 22 (Cat. 2728),\nf. 43, riyad, which means the same (see Med. Soc., 11, 433, sec. 164). It also explains\nwhy Bunana and Bunan were used indiscriminately. Casanova, Reconstitution, writes\nBananat throughout, but no such name is known to me.\n\n187TS 8 J 16, f. 6: address hibs bnyn, Bunén = Bunan (Imala). TS 13 3, . 3,1. 8, ed.\nS. D. Goitein, Sefunot, 8 (1964), 122: “the large house in the neighborhood of habs\nBungn” (1143); TS Arabic Box 40, f. 53, col. II: kabs Bunana; TS Arabic Box 53,\nf. 66, 1. 8: “in the Riya quarter in the district known by the mahbas Bunana” (in Arabic\ncharacters); Casanova, Reconstitution, p. 19 n. 2, has these three versions (which\nreflect real usage and not carelessness of copyists), as well as mahras Bunana. The\nmahras Ammar gave its name to a neighborhood mentioned in an eleventh-century\ndocument (ULCOr 1080 ] 66, 1. 2, see also Ibn Dugmagq, 1V, 25, 1. 8). ENA 2558, f. 4,\nI. 16: mahras al-Sariya (not mentioned elsewhere, it seems) and Abi [qurba] (see Ibn\nDuqmagq, 1V, 23, 1. 4), both near the Mamsiisa quarter. The word for police, shurta,\ncould designate also a police station (see Med. Soc., 11, 607 n. 26).\n\n1*The Sicilian twelfth-century geographer Idrisi has malras in the sense both of\nbarracks and of a hospice for students, travelers, and paupers (see Dozy, Supplément,\n1, 270 a—b). Since the word was used in Egypt interchangeably with mahbas, jail, the\nformer meaning should be assumed as being commonly intended.\n\nTS 16.65, 1. 4, 8, 9: al-sig al-ma<rif bi-hubs yinus wa-yajri fi diwan al-jawami\nwal-masdfid. This place seems not to be noted by the Muslim topographers.\n\n\"®Med. Soc., [1, 368—372.

Table 6 (ibid.,\npp- 89—90) is very useful, but includes matters other than hirasa (which should not\nbe translated as night watch). On the tawwaf see Med. Soc., 11, 86, and 540 n. 96. In\nthe documents analyzed in ibid., pp. 442—443, secs. 18—22, a night watchman re-\nceives regularly five loaves of bread; ibid., p. 440, sec. 6: a payment of 3/8 dirhems;\nibid., p. 451, sec. 43: for three weeks 1 dirhem per week. The bayyat, lit., night man\n(Bodl. MS Heb. f56 [Cat. 2821, no. 16], f. 61, and Gil, Foundations, p. 352), is\nprobably identical with the tawwaf. He is not mentioned by name, and therefore\nalmost certainly was not Jewish.\n\nA payment of an average of 9 1/2 dirhems per month appears seven times in the\naccounts of the communal official Abu 'l-Bayan in the course of the years 1181—1184\n(see the list, Gil, Foundations, p. 90). Gil (p. 89) assumes that this sum represented 4\npercent of the gross revenue from the rent of the houses of which he was in charge.\n\n\"MTS Arabic Box 52, f. 247d, esp. 1. 2—3, 10—~ 11 (Med. Soc., 11, 427, sec. 137, and\nGil, Foundations, pp. 324—325). The name of the watchman, Aba Kallabas, seems to\ncontain the Maghrebi kallabish, the man with the cap, with slight change of the sibilant\n(sh-s-5) (see Dozy, Supplément, 11, 482 a). Khifara is the same as ghifara (Med.

About tib and ¢ad\nsee Maimonides-Meyerhof, pp. 14 ‘—145, and n, 221, below.\n\nThe number of freshening vases brought in by a bride is often not specified, which\nmeans that there were three cr more. In the outfit of a bride which totaled 30 dinars,\nthe bardni cost 2 dinars: Bodl. MS Heb. d 66 (Cat. 2878), £. 77 (1161); in another,\n6 dinars: TS Arabic Box 6, f. 2, col. II, 1. 15. But two cost 13 dinars in TS 16.184,\n1. 14, and three, 15 dinars in TS 16.80, I. 13 (Karaite), both from the first half of the\neleventh century. The “rich bride” had barani mutayyab for 8 dinars and two silver\nbarini worth, together, with a small casket, 5 dinars: TS J 1, f. 29, col. 1L, 1. 31 and\n34.

This was interest-\ning for me, since 1 had always doubted those numbers of overlapping robes given in\nthe Talmud, and here I saw persons engaged in hard work wearing them. It is a\ngeneral law in the histery of human costume that the simple people continue to\npreserve the ways of clothing of the upper classes long after they have abandoned\nthem. BT Gittin 58a reports about a noblewoman of extreme beauty who was cap-\ntured by a bandit and put on the slave market for sale. For this purpose she was clad in\nseven robes.

But before he entered the toilet he took i: off and deposited it on a stool\nnearby clearly in view of its sacral connotation.

The dark blue of the\nindigo is not the ‘natural color of flax, but a certain variety of flax yarn might have\ncome on the market after having been dyed.\n\nIt is noteworthy that practically all these varieties of flax appear in the Geniza\ndocuments of the eleventh century, that is, almost simultaneously.\n\nMuslim handbook of market supervision: Ma¢alim al-Qurba, p. 46 of the English\nsummary, p. 178 of the Bodleian MS.

In no other letter of the eleventh century have I\nseen merchants of Constantinople, Venice, and Crete mentioned together as doing\nbusiness in Alexandria. The Christian merchants from Europe are usually lumped\ntogether under the general term “Riim.” “Constantinople silk” (but not Venetian) is\nmentioned in the Geniza around 1000, Med. Soc., 1, 417 n. 21.\n\nFor “transverse,” diagonally arranged, musallab, see Dozy, Supplément, I, 1176 and\n841a. Four or five of the 400—1000-yard-long threads originally forming the cocoon\nof the silkworm are reeled off simultaneously into one strong yarn, see Weibel, Two\nThousand Years of Textiles, p. 6. Since “transversely” or “crosswise” is mentioned here\nand elsewhere, e.g., TS 13 J 19, f. 27, ll. 27~28, Nahray 14, together with and\ndifferentiated from “twisted,” maftil, contrasting methods of combining the threads\nof the cocoon must be intended. Because of the high price I do not believe that the\nterms refer to the spinning of waste or floss silk (about these see Med. Soc., 1, 104).\n\nThe epithet gati <, “cutting,” “categoric,” “strong,” for khazz, the first quality of silk\n(see Med. Soc., 1, 454 n. 53) has not been seen by me before, but is explained in Pedro\nde Alcala’s Arabic-Castilian Dictionary, printed in Granada 1505, as “fine,” said of a\nthread; see Dozy, Supplément, 11, 374a. To be sure, our letter precedes Pedro by more\nthan four centuries.\n\n2°In a much-torn letter by Barhiin b. MGsa to Nahray b. Nissim, ENA NS 18,\nf. 24v, 1. 1, Gabes silk cost 23 quarter dinars.

Soc., [,454 n. 53), which are exported to Yemen. But\nthis was written around 985, when the land routes between Iran, Iraq, and Arabia\nwere open. (The Zaydis, the sect still prominent in Yemen, who came mainly from\nnorthern Iran, arrived in Yemen by land.) Our letter was written around 1135 and\ndirected to Egypt, by sea, of course.\n\n12Serjeant, Islamic Textiles, pp. 169—170. For Almeria see Goitein, Letters, p. 345\n(Index), Med. Soc., 1, 530 (Index).\n\n'3A note on terminology scems to be appropriate. When the name of a garment is\nfollowed by the word harir “(of ) silk,” it means that it was made of that yarn; e.g., a\nwrap of silk, mayzar harir; 6 dinars, two robes of silk, gamisayn harir, 20 dinars, ENA\nNS2,f. 25,11. 9and 11 (ca. 1178). This is rare, since a garment was often defined by its\ntradename or by the frequently found term kariri, which either meant the same, or,\nwhen combined with another yarn, such as Dabiqi linen (see n. 115, above), only\npartly made of silk.\n\nThe term bi-harir, “with silk,” probably means that the piece concerned was\nadorned with sitk embroidery, tapestry, borders, or bands, see n. 120 above. “An ash\ngray waistband with new silk,” TS NS J 414, L. 1 (see n. 144 below), would then mean\nthat the old silk cord had been replaced by a new one. When the father of the Adenese\nbride orders two fitas (sarilike wraps) “either silk with silk, or silk with linen” (the\nsource in n. 140, above, verso, 1. 23—~24), he wishes to say that the ornament should be\nmade either with silk, probably of another color, or with linen.\n\nFinally, muharrar is defined in Pedro de Alcala’s Vocabulary as silklike, that is, an\nimitation of silk, see Dozy, Supplément, 1, 264a. Its production was mentioned in\nn. 123, above, as a specialty of Abyar, Egypt, but it was found also in Almeria, Spain:\nTS 13 J 21, 1. 12,1. 6 (Goitein, Letters, p. 265, top, where I translated “silken™), and in\nthe estate of an India trader, who died in Aden: Mosseri A-55, 1. 7, India Book 166,\njubbatayn muharrar.\n\n'*“The example in Stillman, “Female Attire,” p. 211 n. 9, TS NS | 414, L. 1 wasat\nquini, stems from an erroneous entry in my card index.

        "text": "ix, B, 1 Notes: Clothing 405\n\n%*Mordants, “the liquids with which fabrics were saturated to hold the dyestuff”\nwere indispensable in the highly developed dyeing industry of the Middle Ages.\nSince they have not been treated coherently in this book, some data about those\noccurring in the Geniza may be in order. It is not surprising that they are identical\nwith those used in Europe at the same time, see Weibel, Two Thousand Years of Textiles,\n\n. 8.\n\nP Alum (potassium), shabb, the most common mordant, was priced in Alexandria at\none hundred pounds for 15 dirhems (the reading is perfectly clear but perhaps a\nscribal error: TS 10 J 15, f. 14v, l. 3, Nahray 8. Hope to sell it to Europeans in\nAlexandria: Gottheil-Worrell XXXIII, p. 152, 1. 22. (The printed text is faulty; the\nmanuscript has this: wa-kon qawm rim wa-nahn naridhic alayhim). Brilliant alum\n{shabb mudarham, cf. Dozy, Supplément, 11, 438b) ordered: TS 16.274v, 1. 17. These\nthree letters are from the later part of the eleventh century.\n\nLarge quantities of widely different qualities of alum were sent from Fez, Moracco,\nto Almeria, Spain, in Dec. 1141, Goitein: Letters, p- 267. For the importance of the\nquality of alum sec R. S. Lopez, “Market Expansion: The Case of Genova,” Journal of\nEconomic History, 24 (1964), 458. Alum was the main product of the Chad in inner\nAfrica, from where it was exported to Egypt and Morocco (and from both to Europe),\nsee Mez, Renaissance, chap. 24, p. 412. Alum was also found in Egyptitself, as well as in\nYemen, see Med. Soc., 1, 45.\n\nThe gallnut, ‘afs, an excrescence of oak trees in northern Syria, served as a\nmedication against fever and intestinal troubles, but mainly as a mordant for fixing\nblack dye. (It was also used to produce the excellent ink that we still admire in the\nGeniza documents), see Maimonides-Meyerhof, p- 144, sec. 295. It was a main article\nof import from northern Syria to Egypt, mentioned first among products arriving on\nfive boats in Alexandria from Suwaydiyya, the port of Antioch, Med. Soc., I,213. The\nwriter announcing that arrival notes that because of the high price (4 1/2 dinars per\ngintdr [100 pounds], see below) he did not dare to buy those gallnuts, TS Arabic Box\n18(1), £. 164, I1. 11-12 (eleventh century). A bale (ca. 500 pounds) of “afs was sent\nfrom Syria to the warehouse of a qadi in Fustat for two Jewish brothers forming a\npartnership (TS 16.87, 1. 9, a court record written in spring 1097). Nahray b. Nissim\ndealt in this commodity, once paying 5 1/4 dinars for “a qintar and something” (TS K\n15, f. 114w, L. 13, Nahray 42, and DK I, 1. 20, Nahray 167, which refers to the same\nshipment. See also TS 10 ] 19, . 8, 1. 8, Nahray 212, for profits made with gallnuts).\nThe family name <afsi, processor and/or seller of gallnuts, occurs quite frequently in\nthe Geniza around 1100, but they might all have belonged to the same stock (Aba\nNasr, a contributor to public appeals: TS K 15, f. 106, 1. 5, cf. Med. Soc., 11,477, sec.\n16, and TS Misc. Box 28, f. 29, Med. Soc., 11, 477 sec. 17. Abii Sa <id, recipient of\nletters: TS 8 J 15, f. 25, an order for spices and dyes, and Bodl.

Soc., 11, 476, sec. 15,\nand repeatedly mentioned in letters of others).\n\nTartar (Ar. tartdr, derived from the same medieval Greek word as the English) was\nanother mordant, also coming to the capital of Egypt via Alexandria. A quantity of\n200 jarwi (somewhat heavier than regular pounds), sent to the purplemaker Ariis b.\nJoseph in Fustat, cost 10 13/48 dinars, that is, approximately the same as gallnuts (see\nabove): ULC Or 1080 J 178, l. 610, 28—27, verso, Il. 13— 14. From another letter\nfrom Alexandria, in which the material is described as tartar powder (cf. English salt\nof tartar, daqq al-tartar) it appears that the best quality was to be had from the\nMaghreb: TS NS J 344, lI. 4=7. A letter from Tlemgen, Algeria, complains, how-\never, that tartir sold poorly, giving the impression that there it was an article of\nimport: TS 12.274v, L. 10.\n\nS\"TS 12.468, 1. 4 (written in Qayrawan 977/8), ed.

Dozy, Supplément, 1, 1, quoting an ancient Muslim source, which\nexplains that ebb was the indigenous Arabic word for oak, whereas ballit, the\ncommonly used term, was a loanword (it is indeed Aramaic, see Fraenkel, Aramdische\nFremdwérter, p. 139).\n\nThe term ’b’by might also be derived from ubab or abab, mirage, glistening by\nreflection. Since the word has not yet been found elsewhere, both my reading and\nexplanations must be regarded as tentative.\n\n*'Honeydew: manni, see n. 176, above.\n\n*2A¢ the time of the writing of the letter this Muslim artisan happened to be in\nFustat.

The word may be read shuhra’, or\nshukhari (* preceding ). True, enduring deep black is the most difficult color to\nproduce, and the best dye to be used for this, according to Weibel, Two Thousand Years\nof Texitles, p. 11, is lamp soot.\n\n**How much profit was expected from the sale of a wimple may be seen from a\ncontemporary account written by Nahray b. Nissim, in which this detail occurs: “A\nwimple, 2 1/2 [dinars]; another one, 2 1/4; profit from this, 5 qirats,” about 4 1/2\npercent. TS J 1, £. 1v, col. 1V, first col. on the margin, L. 1.

It was popular also in\nwestern Europe during the Middle Ages. W. Heyd, Histoire du commerce du Levant au\nMoyen-Age (Leipzig, 1885/6), p. 700, says that “the Orientals” dyed it almost always in\ndark blue, while in Europe one preferred a lively red. Heyd probably referred to a\nperiod later than that represented in our documents.\n\nFor the siglaton garment see Goitein, Letters, p. 77; for the siglaton donated, Eretz\nIsrael, L. A. Mayer volume, 7 (1964), 92 (Heb.), Il. 8—14, 171 (Engl.).\n\nThe bride in App. D, Doc. I11, below, had three siglaton robes (col.

This\nvoluminous book is important for medieval studies because it shows how completely\nGreek and Roman techniques were assimilated in the Near East during Late Antiq-\nuity and the early Middle Ages. For a relief depicting a fuller treading cloth in a vat\nsee Donald Strong and David Brown, Roman Crafis (New York, 1976), p. 176. The\nfuller was also employed for washing clothes. Female fullers occur in the Talmud\n(probably as laundresses), but not in the Geniza.\n\nBecause of the use of fuller’s earth, taff, the fuller was also called taffal (which could\nalso mean “dealer in tafl”); TS 13 J 20, 1. 18, 1. 18, ed. Mann, 11, 300, where the taffal’s\nson is described in Heb., Il. 16, 23 as gassar (spelled gs). Fuller's earth was also used in\nhouseholds: TS 8 ] 25, f. 2, where Halfon b, Manasse, Fustat, the court clerk, receives\nsome from his brother Japheth of Alexandria. Dozy, Supplément, 11, 48b—49a, has\ndetailed information about the different varieties of this soapy cleaning stuff. “Ful-\nler’s earths,” tafil, in the plural, are indeed mentioned in a price list from Almetia,\nSpain; TS 12.285, . 19, India Book 202, but only with the remark that none of them\nwas in demand.\n\nIt must not have been easy to find a competent fuller.

When no answer was received, I had it both sprayed and\nbeaten and forwarded it; please let me know whether it has arrived”: TS 10J 14, . 13,\n. 612 (abridged).\n\n#3ULC Or 1080 ] 291 (dated 1024), trans. Goitein, Lelters, p. 275, Dozy, Supplément,\n1, 309a. Dozy’s mihakka is the instrument. My voweling, mahakka, designates the\naction.\n\n*Previously I translated this as “mangler” (Med. Soc., 11,474, where “manger” isa\nmisprint) and the process as ironing (Letters, p. 265, sec. A and passim). But the\nmangle and the hot iron had not yet been invented; the Arabs used a press as the\nGreeks, Romans, and the Near Eastern peoples had done before them.\n\n**3In Goitein, Leiters, p. 265, a man from Fez, Morocco, orders a silk robe from\nAlmeria, Spain “to be pressed in the very best way” and to be sent to him as quickly as\npossible. A malhafa cloak, woven and “whitened” in Alexandria, was pressed there\nbefore being transported to Fustat; TS 8 J 25, f. 13, 1. 23. The wages for the weaving\nof 25 cubits of material amounted to 5 qirats, and the whitening and pressing of the\nsame quantity to 3 1/2 qirats. Since “whitening,” bayad, was done both with yarns and\nfabrics (see Letters, p. 134 n. 4, and p. 135 n. 4), the term probably describes the\ncleaning of linen materials from their blackish crust, see n. 198 above. (The mubayyid,\ncommon in the Geniza, is the man who makes copper vessels “white” by tinning\nthem.)\n\n*%See preceding note and nn. 23, 24, above and App. D, n. 82,\n\n207ENA NS 22, f. 17 margin and verso, Il. 1—10: Jacob b.

In TS K 15, £. 95, 1. 5 (dated\nMay 1150), the word is spelled bygy’r, which indicates that around the middle of the\ntwelfth century the word was pronounced bigydr.\n\n21*The seemingly strange fact that the turban consumed more material than a piece\nserving as a garment is discussed in nn. 55~66, above.\n\n2The common word for weaver, hd'ik, is by no means avoided in the Geniza; even\ncontributors to an important public appeal are referred to thus: Bodl. MS Heb.d 79\n(no Cat.), I. 35, col. I1v, see Med. Soc., 11,479, sec. 21. Since the weaver was held in the\nNear East with a certain disrespect (from Talmudic times, Krauss, Talmudische\nArchiologe, 1, 149), probably because weaving was originally a female occupation, the\nterm sdni¢, artisan, was preferred for this occupation. The Jews of $an‘a, Yemen,\ncalled the weaver sanna*, and derived from this the verb yisni ¢, weaving. A similar\nusage might have been common in the Maghreb from which the writer of our letter\nhailed.\n\n**This is, of course, only a partial and final payment. The real wages must have\nbeen a multiple of it. The wages for the malhafa, mentioned in the last paragraph\ntranslated, amounted, after some haggling and discounts granted, to 36 dirhems.\nThe reader is reminded that this letter was preceded by others dealing with the same\nmatters.\n\nGoitein, S.

In TS 10 J 13, f. 5v, ll. 3—4, the writer orders “a\nhalf-and-half magta©, two ‘throws’ [of the shuttle), ramyatayn, cotton, two ‘throws’\ncoarse linen.” (“Half-and-half \" is spelled munassafa, with a Heb. sin, which stands for\ns.) The twelfth-century Sicilian geographer Idrisi describes the magta© as being made\nmainly of linen, see Dozy, Supplément, 11, 374b.\n\nThe maqta®, like the thawb, was worn by men and women alike. An old woman was\nasked whether she wished to get a maqta® mugaffal (lit., locked, i.e., to be closed by\nloops), 13 cubits long and costing 10 dirhems, ENA 1822 f. 53. In the thirteenth\ncentury it became fashionable to wear a {afsila, a tailored piece, above the straight\nmagqtac; both were embroidered: “The embroidery on the white maqta® and the\ntafsila is not yet completed,” ULC Add. 3415 (dated 1237). In a fragmentary trous-\nseau list from the same period the maqta® has the color of rose marmalade, ward\nmurrabba, and the tafsila that of sesame, TS NS Box 325, f. 13. When we read in Alf\nLayla (Night 25), 1, 77, 1. 20, that a woman wore a tafsila made exclusively of gold\nthreads, we are sure that this was an upper garment. In trousseau lists the item\nJakaniyyatayn maqati¢, two jukaniyya (short) robes in maqta® fashion or cut, are\ncommon, e.g., PER H 20, 1. 7, and Stillman, “Female Attire,” pp. 84—85.\n\nIt must be noted that maqta® was used also in its original meaning of “a piece,” even\nwhen not referring to clothing. In the marriage contract TS 20.7 (dated 1050), when\ntwo khusrawdni, kingly, maqtac s are listed between an emerald-colored canopy and\ncurtains, no doubt wall hangings or carpets were intended, When a maqta‘ made of\nthe precious tali material, a full four spans broad and costing 3 dinars and 2 qirats,\nwas sent from Cairo fo Alexandria in 1141 with the remark that no other piece like\nthis could be found in the capital, its use was certainly different from that of the\nAlexandrian magqta®: TS 20.80, 1. 10, and TS 13 ] 23, f. 21, margin and top, India\nBook 273 and 130, respectively.\n\nIt is interesting that in M. A. Marzouk, History of Textile Indusiry in Alexandria 331\nB.C.—1517 A.p. (Alexandria 1955), pp. 58—61, where, based on literary sources, “The\nKinds of Alexandrian Textiles” (in Islamic times) are listed, no mention of the\nmaqtac is made. This is not a reflection on the author, who seems to be more\ninterested in pre-Islamic times, but another indication of the usefulness of the Geniza\nfor the knowledge of socioeconomic conditions in medieval Egypt.\n\nOn the textiles of Ascalon, Palestine, see Goitein, Letters, p. 288 n. 7.\n\n#2The original use of shugga for textiles manufactured in Tunisia is well exempli-\n\nGoitein, S.

MS Heb. b 3 (Cat. 2806), f. 19, Nahray 7. Later in the letter (f. 20, 1. 8)\nhe promises: “I shall buy you profitable goods, and I have already started to buy raw\nQarawis.” When he sends, this time from Fustat, two Siisi shuqqas, each worth over 3\ndinars, as well as a perfumed one, mutayyaba, costing approximately the same, it is\nmost likely that this and other shuqqas handled by Nahray at that time were of\nTunisian make: TS 10 J 12, f. 26, 1l. 13—~15, Nahray 5. But when one Maghrebi writes\nto another in Egypt, he uses the term “shuqqa” also for a garment woven in Alexan-\ndria, cf. n. 210, above. Although, as in the case just referred to, measurements are\nprovided for a custom-made shuqqa, the shugqa in general must have had a standard\nsize, as may be concluded from an order like this, sent by a Maghrebi in Busir, south\nof Cairo, to another in Fustat; he wishes to have a shugga and a half of twill, to cut frcm\nit a thawb and pants: TS 12.227v, Il. 13—15.

When a merchant writes that he will offer for sale the Sisis (clothes\nmade in Siisa, Tunisia) and the firakh (pl. of farkha), it is clear that Sicilian materials\nare referred to, TS 13 J 14, f. 2,11. 21—22, Nahray 17. When the boats from Sicily did\nnot arrive in Alexandria, and two Sicilian farkhas ordered were not to be had, one\nhad to content oneself with Egyptian thawbs, TS 13 J 18, f. 8, see n. 49, above.

My assistant,\nPaula Sanders, provided me with another example from Arabic literature: Magrizi,\nKhitat, 1, 472, 1. 1112, describing the figure of an elephant made of “kneaded”\namber with large gems as eyes, each with a golden nail, “the black of which was\ntreated,” mismér dhakab mujra sawaduhu.\n\n4551117: Bodl.

Rabbi Yohanan's (third century)\ndictum “one does not talk during a meal” is a medical advice referring to the actual\neating (BT Ta<anit 5b). “Saying a word of Torah at the table” was almost obligatory\n(Mishna Avot 3:3).

The title thigat al-dawla, Trusted by the\nGovernment, and the like are old; but the abbreviated form is late. Female names of\nthe type Majdiyya are also late. The only dated document bearing that name known\nto me is from summer 1253, written in Baalbek, Lebanon (TS Misc.

Between the opening\nand concluding holidays of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, on neither of which\nwriting is permitted, there are five other days, on which, according to the prevailing\nopinion, writing is allowed; see App. D, n. 201. In Alexandria, which was dependent\nspiritually on both Palestine and Cairo, not only the Era of Creation but also that “of\nthe Documents” was used in abbreviated forms for dating.

The little the merchants still had\nwas hidden in their houses.\n\n?*Wholesale trade in wheat was conducted in hundreds of irdabbs. Thus one irdabb\ncost 2.25 dinars.\n\n#'Since 36 dirhems of low silver content were contained in a dinar, the price of six\nwaybas (6 X 14) or an irdabb would amount to 2 1/3 dinars, an astonishingly slight\ndifference between the wholesale and the retail price.\n\n**Thus, the number of loaves to be had for 1 dirhem was one-fourth of the average\nand “steady” quantity of six loaves per dirhem reported from the capital in the\npreceding letter, nn. 87—90, above.\n\n?Here follow notes about repairs in a synagogue financed by income from a fundugq\n(see Index), which shows the writer as engaged in communal affairs, and a report\nabout the dearth and brackishness of water in Alexandria, sce A, 2, n. 115, above.\n\n**The high rank of the Muslim would prevent his being robbed; moreover, the toll\nactually paid by him at the entrance to the city would be less than that imposed on the\naverage traveler.

Permission to eat meat was granted\nafter Noah had sacrificed some of the animals carried with him in the Ark (Genesis\n1:29; 9:3). The eminent Bible scholar, Jehezkel Kaufmann, said that the sages of the\nTalmud had made the consumption of meat so difficult that if they had been given\nmore time they would have ended up by making vegetarianism obligatory. (Kauf-\nmann himself was a vegetarian.)\n\nJust as the animal offered to God in the Temple had to be without blemish, thus\nmeat consumed by man with God’s blessing had to be “kosher,” which means the\nsame. The many rules defining this state of faultlessness gave rise to different\ninterpretations, with the result that carcasses declared by one expert as “kosher” were\nprohibited for consumption by others. A long letter by the Rabbanites of Ramle,\nPalestine, to their brethren in Fustat exemplifies the troubles caused by such a\nsituation, TS 20.19, 1. 30—49, ed. in Goitein, Palestinian Jewry, pp. 129—143. Other\nexamples could be provided.\n\nKaraites refrained from eating beef or mutton in Jerusalem, because no animal\nofferings could be made there after the Temple was destroyed, ULC Add 3430\n(1028, a marriage contract, see App. D., Doc.

Sahlan’s comparatively small marriage\ngift also points to a union realized later in life.\n\n“See, e.g., TS Misc. Box 29, f. 29, ed. Ashtor, Mamluks, 111, 32—37: a very substan-\ntial ketubba totaling 560 nominal and 280 real dinars, has no items of furnishings or\nhousewares. On the other hand, TS Arabic Box 4, f. 4, and TS K 25, f. 42, which\ntogether form perhaps the most detailed trousseau list of the thirteenth century,\nalready comprise 2 number of the newfangled terms for garments, but possess also a\nremarkably rich assortment of copper and other housewares, perhaps the richest in\nthe Geniza. Bedding is very poor, however, and represented only by the mattress-like\ntarrdha: there is not a single martaba, or sofa, an item rarely absent from a middle-\nclass ketubba during the Fatimid period. Even the Karaite bride from Jerusalem,\n1028, had two (Doc. I), while the rich bride (Doc. 111) had five (in addition to other\nsitting and bedding facilities). Should we assume that sitting habits had changed and\nthat the knee-high martaba had been replaced by the far lower tarrdha and the like?\nCompare Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands, illus. 17, facing p. 316 (a kind of tarraha),\nwith illus. 19 (martaba, on which one would sit, not in the European way as did the\nnineteenth-century Jewish family depicted, but with the legs crossed). The tarrdha\nalso replaces the martaba in other ketubbas from the Mamluk period, e.g., Ashtor,\nMamluks, 111, 68, 71.\n\n\"With the exception of TS Arabic Box 4, f. 4 and TS K 25, f. 42, see preceding note,\nwhere the value of the trousseau was estimated at 372 1/2 dinars, if my understanding\nof the various partial and final summaries is correct. Throughout the list Coptic\nnumerals are used.

It is a sign of the popularity\nof Arabic poetry that Jewish parents gave this name to a son.\n\n2The same obligations are repeated in other words.\n\n#'This was obligatory among Karaites; with the Rabbanites twenty-five silver pieces\nwere the gift due a virgin.\n\n2In practice, the “additional” bridal gift was the main one.\n\n23As in Malachi 2:14.\n\n*Genesis 2:18.\n\n23Genesis 3:16. From the husband love and affection, hibba, is expected; from the\nwife, love and considerateness, h#sa, a standard term in Karaite ketubbot.\n\n2Not of her kin, since her father was not a Kohen.

V, 1. 13, was a\nprecious, broad wristband, often inlaid with pearls. Our women normally wear one\nbracelet of the same type; in Geniza times—as in those of the biblical patriarchs, see\nGenesis 24:22—invariably bracelets were worn in pairs, one of the same type on each\narm. When only one was available (e.g., as reported in the Geniza, when a mother\ngave one to each of her two daughters) the list notes expressly: one single bracelet.\n\n**The two missing superscriptions are taken from TS 16.80 (fragmentary), also\nKaraite and fairly contemporary with our ketubba; the bride was well-to-do.

The term ridawani, like a rida’, or mantle, describes the wimple as\nparticularly long and broad.\n\n*The cag(a)biyya is very common in the Geniza, but I have not yet found it\nelsewhere.

I derive the word from <agb, heel, and explainitasa\nrobe reaching down to the ground, unlike the usual dress, which exposed the lower\nend of the pants to the eye (as may be seen on thirteenth-century miniatures depicting\nboth women and men.

Here,\nsomething special might have happened. As often at weddings of people with little\nmoney, there was probably a squabble over the estimate, and finally an agreement\nabout the total owed by the husband was reached.\n\n“The dowry remains the property of the wife; the husband may use it with her\nconsent.\n\nS°Rabbinical law was not as outspoken and liberal in this matter as the Karaite\ndispensation.\n\n$1Literally, her families, that is, from her father’s side.

The lizam should not be\nconfused with the labbih, made of rows of filigree work, the main ornament on the\nupper breast. The old hostess of the French Jewish explorer Joseph Halévy and his\nYemenite companion Hayyim Habshiish wore both a lazam and a labbih, see Goitein,\nTravels in Yemen, p. 108, 1. 2, Engl. summary, p. 63.\n\nThe lazam of Geniza times must have looked similar to that still worn by Yemenite\nJewish women a generation ago, for in several trousseau lists it is described as\nconsisting of five rows: TS 24.9,1. 12; TS 13 ] 6, f. 9v, item 1, 1. 4; TS NS Box 324, f.\n144, 1. 6.

In L. 2, above, there was a similar dispute about definition.\nThe object was first described as a kerchief, then upgraded to a wimple.

Brides had them in considerable quantities like here; in one case twenty, costing\n30 dinars: TS 24.9, 1. 28.

But niina designates a single fish, and, although Jonah'’s fish was a\npopular medieval ornament, I doubt that it is intended here.\n\n16t As the price indicates, “complete” probably includes the utensils regularly kept\nin such a box, see n. 163, below.\n\n192G pain was a main exporter of fine copper ware in those days, see Doc.

MS Heb. f 56 (Cat.\n2821) f. 48, L. 3 and 13. Here, between mandil, kerchief, and luffakha the word si’'m is\nwritten; saldm, of course, means peace, greetings. The same combination “two salam\nkerchiefs” in TS K 25, f. 269, col. I, L. 27.

Here, where Mevorakh\nb. Nathan took an inventory at the very time when the objects to be noted were put\ninto receptacles, he permitted himself abbreviations; in Doc.

Tinnis linen: B, n. 121.\n\n28 Ar. quwdra, literally, scrap, something carved out, cut out, for instance, a round\npiece of cloth, especially for covering a table, Maqrizi, Khitat, 1, 472, quoted by M. A.\nMarzouk, History of Textile Indusiry in Alexandria (Alexandria, 1955), p. 96, and found\nin this sense in ENA 1822, f. 57, 1. 21, “a green quwara for the table,” sent from the\nMaghreb to Alexandria. Sigtaton quwaras are mentioned early in the eleventh cen-\ntury, TS 12.12, 1. 22; a Yemenite quwdra occurs together with other textiles from\nYemen in a long trousseau list from the thirteenth century, TSK 25, f. 42,1. 10.

The original meaning\nof slip case in TS 10 ] 5, f. 15 {November 1021): a scribe undertakes to copy the books\nof Prophets and Hagiographs, to bind them, and to make slip cases for them. In the\ngeneral sense of a container with a rigid cover: TS 16.32, 1. 16 (also early eleventh\ncentury), where it is used for lingerie, that is, for textiles, as in our document; TS\n12.520v, L. 9 (Jan. 1105, inventory of the estate of a foreigner), where it contains\noil-painted wood, but is crossed out and replaced by gimatra, which Arabic word is\nderived from the Aramaic, as is well known from the Talmud, also with the original\nsense of a receptacle for books (BT Megilla 26). In TS 10 J 11, f. 2, 1. 5 the learned\nNagid Mevorikh b. Sa ¢adya is lauded as “a bookcase” with this Talmudic expression.\nSee A, 4, n. 191, above. For another use of this word see n. 291, below.\n\n*° Ar. marhamdan, not found by me anywhere, but self-explanatory: marham, band-\nages (Ar.), dan, a Persian affix denoting a container.\n\n**'Since the word is clearly written and occurs also in l. 5, there can be no doubt\nabout its reading; its meaning is defined by the addition “for kohl containers.” This\nterm should not be taken too narrowly.

        "text": "466 Notes: Selected Documents ix, App. D\n\nmon in Geniza documents of the first half of the eleventh century, but disappears\nlater entirely. In ENA NS 3, f. 24, 1. 15, a gold jan is worth 25 dinars, see Friedman,\nMarriage, no. 1. Furthermore, TS 13 ] 17, f. 14v,1. 1(1030/1), see Med. Soc., 111, 182\nandn. 110; TS 13 ] 1, £. 12, 1. 8 (1049), see ibid., 111, 183 and n. 118. In Al-Taniikhi,\nNishwar ai-Muhadara (Beirut, 1971), 1, 272 n. 1, it is a common piece of jewelry\npossessed by the concubines of the narrator. (When he urgently needed money foran\nunforeseen demand, he asked them to deliver their jéns to him.) That happened in\ntenth-century Baghdad. Thus the jan obviously was an Eastern (Irani-Iragi) orna-\nment imported to Egypt by the many immigrants from that region, but later went out’\nof fashion.\n\n258The clerk used here the Aramaic word izg, after he had written in the same line\nArabic khatam for ring. Because of the religious significance of rings at the conclusion\nof a marriage, the Aramaic word perhaps lingered on in Jewish speech. In tenth-\ncentury marriage documents, where the trousseau lists are partly in Aramaic, “izg, of\ncourse, is constantly used.\n\n209Ar. madrab (in the Geniza found by me only here), see Dozy, Supplément, 11,7, last\nitem (taken from an Arabic-Spanish dictionary printed in Granada 1505), it is\ndescribed as a glass vial. Here, too, the small vessel might have been made partly of\nglass (and only in part of silver).\n\n2See Med. Soc., 111, 405, no. 181, where 50 + 40 is to be changed to 40 + 50.\n\n#'Flat or plain, Ar. sadhija. Here the clerk skipped over one word, probably a type\nof bracelet and not adorned with pearls or filigree. In the next two lines he wrote\n“rings” twice. In L. 5 earrings with pearls are noted.\n\n27*This shoulder band, katifiyya or kitfiyya, probably consisted of two interconnected\nchains, one having the gold apple and the other the gold “cherry plum,” as its center\npiece. See n. 290, below, and B, nn. 489492, above.\n\n*73A minor difficulty in the dating of this document must be clarified. Our record is\nitem HI of a series of five records written on six pages by the scribe Mevorakh b,\nNathan. Item II, which is written on the reverse side of item I, is clearly dated:\n“During the last ten days of the month Adar II of the year of the Documents 1470,”\nwhich corresponds to March 11-20, 1159. The format of items 111 is smaller than\nthat of the following pages. Item Il is stuck to our document, which seems to show\nthat they were preserved and later disposed of in the Geniza together. Our document\nbears no date, but its second page is found on a sheet containing items IV and V, in\nboth of which the number 70 is written in an awkward way, possibly to be read as 60,\n“Oth of Siwan,” which would correspond to May 18, 1149. If this were true, the four\npages of items I1I—V would be the oldest dated documents from Mevérikh’s hand,\nsee Med. Soc., 11,514, sec. 22. For the purpose of our study, it is irrelevant whether the\ndate was 1159 or 1149.\n\n274A tiara with the same number of pieces in Doc. IV, 1. 6, above, see B, n. 460,\nabove. .\n\n7> About this ornament worn on the chest see n. 142, above.\n\n276The same in Doc. IV, 1. 9 and Doc. V, 1. 16, above.\n\n277See n. 141, above.\n\n#5See n. 143, above. The word hadida was crossed out, because the scribe had\noverlooked the gold khiisa palm leaf. The hadida is properly listed in the next line.\nThere was no similarity in form between the bracelet and the khasa ornament.\n\n*Ar. sharraba or shurraba, pl. shararib. The tassel was probably formed by gold\nthreads.\n\n2°Ar, 5'fry; the form sifiri, although derived from sf7, yellow, is strange. Perhaps\nZafirl is meant, namely, gold coins with the name of the caliph al-Zafir (ruled\n1149—1154) ornamenting the pins, see Lane-Poole, History of Egypt, pp. 171—173.\n\n81 Ar. madhaf, see n. 96, and Doc. 111, col. I, 1. 20, above, where the same price is\nattached to it.\n\n282Gee n. 145, above.\n\n283 Ar, kummathrd'iyya, a flat piece of silver, having the outline of a pear; here not\nforming an ornament for a pin, as in Doc. 11, col.

My\nintention then was to save of the New Series of documentary character (NS J) as much\nas possible, irrespective of the content. I copied TS 13 J 7, £. 8, in July 1977 from an\nexcellent photostat because of my interest in the terms of material civilization oc-\ncurring in it. That the two fragments belong together and form one complete\ndocument was realized only on Nov. 16, 1980, when I worked on this Appendix.\n\n7 According to my addition: 488.

But there is no doubt about the correction intended, as the total of the estimate\nproves.\n\n#0Ar. gildda (spelled here without alif), usually translated as necklace; but as the\nnumber of beads, the similarity with the katfiyya (see n. 272, above), and the meaning\nof the root (girding with a sword) seem to indicate, probably, some larger ornament is\nmeant. Lane, Modern Egyptians, p. 572, describes it as “a long kind of necklace,\nreaching to the girdle.” Similarly in Stillman, Palestinian Costume, p. 94. That even in\nancient Arabia the gildda must have been a very substantial piece may be deduced\nfrom this curious story told by Ibn Abi d-Dunya, The Noble Qualities of Character, ed.\nJames A. Bellamy (Wiesbaden, 1973), p. 95, no. 343: when in the battle of Badr, the\nfirst fought in Islam, the husband of Muhammad’s stepdaughter (who fought in the\nMeccan army) was taken prisoner, his wife sent the gilada of her mother Khadija\n(Muhammad’s wife) as ransom for her husband.

The work is remarkable for its sheer magni-\ntude, but more particularly for the humane sensibility and imagination, the skill, and the\nformidable learning that it reflects.”\n\nThe Haskins Medal Committee\n\n“This is a most readable book. . . . A new vista of research has opened for the student\nof history of Mediterranean countries during the Middle Ages. . . . An outstanding\naccomplishment.”\n\nHarry Poppers, American Historical Review\n\n“A truly remarkable achievemert. . . . When we consider that [previously] consulting Geniza\nmaterials was possible only for the learned few, we may measure the debt we all owe Goitein.\n... Given the exceptional importance of the Geniza and the unusual difficulties posed by its\ncontents, we understand how much we have been given.”\n\nJacob Newsner, Journal of the Academy of Religion\n$.D.

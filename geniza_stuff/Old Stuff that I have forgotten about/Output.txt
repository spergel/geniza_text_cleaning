Preface


 A LITTLE-KNOWN but fairly representative section of the medieval world
 is portrayed in this book with the aid of a unique historical source, the
 documents of the Cairo Geniza (pronounced gheneeza). Here, middle-
 class people from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries have left
 us their letters, court records, contracts, accounts, and other writings
 in a haphazard selection, as they deposited them in a geniza, or lumber
 room. For these people believed that writings on which the name of
 God might be found should not be destroyed, but should be buried
 like the human body. In this way, quite unintentionally, many thou-
 sands of documents of the most variegated and often of very intimate
 character have been preserved. This material is invaluable for the
 knowledge of social groups to which the historian up till now has had
 little or no access.
Most of these documents, which were unearthed in Old Cairo and
 now are found in many libraries all over the world, are written in
 Hebrew characters and in the Arabic language. In general, they ema-
 nate from Jews who lived in the Islamic countries of the Mediterranean,
 which at the beginning of the Geniza period included most of Spain and
 Sicily. Thus, these papers form a first-rate source for the social history
 of the Jewish community on the one hand and of Islamic civilization on
 the other. Since many of them concern international trade, they are
 also of significance for the history of the Mediterranean basin in gen-
 eral.
The idea of this book was first conceived by me on September 17,
1954, while in Oxford, searching the treasures of the Bodleian Library
 for Geniza documents relating to the India trade for a book still in
 preparation on that subject. (Then I had a fancy title for it: "Living
Parchments.") On June 15, 1955, I wrote about my intention to publish
 a volume of this character to Clemens Heller of the Ecole Pratique des
 Hautes Etudes (VI" section), Paris, who had done much to further the
preparation of the book about the India trade. Being occupied with the
 collection, deciphering, copying, and interpretation of the India papers,
 I made little progress with the new project. The turning point came in
 summer, 1958, this time while I was on one of my fifteen visits to the
University Library, Cambridge, England, the Mecca of Geniza studies.
By that time, it had become evident to me that the India trade, as far as







 reflected in the Geniza, was carried out largely by merchants who had
 their base in the Mediterranean area. I felt that it was necessary to
 elucida:e first the institutions and ways of life of the native countries of
 those enterprising men before their specific contributions to the com-
 merce with India could be properly assessed. At the same time, while
 I was still in Cambridge, there arrived a letter from Dr. G. E. von
 Grunebaum, dated August 18, 1958, suggesting that I participate in the
 new publication program undertaken jointly by the Near Eastern Cen-
 ter of the University of California and the University of California
 Press. This decided the matter. I was off India and on the Mediter-
 ranean.
Both Dr. von Grunebaum and I assumed that with the general
 knowledge of the Geniza world acquired by me during ten years of
 research I would be able to produce a concise but all-around account
 of it. I tried for six months. Slowly it dawned upon me that it was risky
 to write a summary of something the totaJity of which was yet very
 incompletely known. Too many Geniza documents had never been read
 by anyone, and the great surprises of ten provided by newly deciphered
 documents made one hesitant to draw conclusions from manuscripts
 read on material still untouched. Thus, there ripened the bold resolu-
 tion first to make a survey of the documentary Geniza in toto. I tried to
 read, albeit cursorily, the whole body of manuscripts of nonliterary
 character from the Cairo Geniza which are preserved in the libraries of
 Europe, the United States, and Israel, to card-index the more significant
 and especially the more difficult ones (so far as this had not been done
 hy others), and to extract from them whatever information seemed
 likely to contribute to the portrait of the society depicted in them. After
 seven years, with a visit to the libraries of Leningrad in summer, 1965,
 the survey came to a preliminary conclusion. Preliminary, for I do not
 claim, by any means, to have succeeded in seeing all the relevant manu-
 scripts or to have noted everything of significance. But I do hope that
 this study, to comprise three volumes, represents a fairly complete
 inventory of the Geniza, I mean, that it conveys an idea of the topics
 and types of information to be found in the Geniza documents.
This study is called A Mediterranean Society because the people de-
 scribed in it are to a certain extent representative of their class in the
 :Mediterranean world in general, and its Arabic section in particular.
 Parallels and contrasts with sources outside the Geniza are pointed out
 occasionally. An attempt to do so throughout would have increased the
 size of the work to impossible dimensions.
It is perhaps not superfluous to remark that I regard my work as that
 of historian and philologist, not that of expounder of sodoeconomic or
 political theories. Then I found that free enterprise, a monetary econ-
 omy, and fluid forms of cooperation were conducive to the compara-
 th·ely salutary state of the Geniza period (as opposed to the preceding
 and, especially, the following periods), I do not intend to express herein







 an opinion about the absolute value of these phenomena. The same
 applies to questions of religion, law, morals, and manners touched upon
 in the subsequent volumes.
The text of this study is organized in such a way that the reader who
 is interested in some technical details, or in the linguistic aspects of
 the documents quoted, or who wants to check a manuscript or a text
 previously edited, may consult the Notes at the end of the book where
 they do not interrupt the readers who have no need for them. The con-
 tents of volumes II and III are herein provided in outline. The Author's
 Note answers questions that might arise in connection with unfamiliar
 terms, the spelling of Arabic and Hebrew words, and the use of the
 Notes. Appendixes A and B contain concise information on dates,
 names, coins, weights, and measures. Appendixes C and D on industrial
 partnerships and the exchange rate of money complement chapters ii,
 2, and iii, F, respectively.
A bibliography is not included. Since the three volumes touch on al-
 most every aspect of the life of a middle class, a list of the books and
 articles used in their preparation might well fill a fourth. The list of
 Abbreviations and Symbols gives a general idea of the main reference
 books and journals used, while the Notes provide additional biblio-
 graphic information for individual sections.
Concurrently with this work a companion volume, called Mediter-
 ranean People, is being prepared, which contains translations of many
of the Geniza texts discussed here. In the Notes an asterisk after the
 shelf mark of a manuscript cited means that its translation is included
in that collection. It is hoped that the publication of Mediterranean
People will follow close behind that of Volume II of this work.
A work of the character described could not have been carried out
without generous help from many different quarters. I am deeply in-
debted to H. R. Creswick, Librarian, University Library, Cambridge,
England, who showed much personal interest in the Geniza treasures
entrusted to his care, and to his staff, in particular Dr. S. A. Skilliter,
who worked in the library when the New Series of the Taylor-Schechter
 Collection was started (seep. 4); to the former and present presidents
and librarians of Westminster College, Cambridge; to Bodley's Li-
brarian and the staff of the Bodleian Library, Oxford; to the former and
present Keeper, Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts, as well as to
the present Assistant Keeper at the British Museum; to the Director
and staff of the John Rvlands Library, Manchester; to the Conserva-
teur honoraire and Librarian of the Alliance Israelite Universelle,
Paris; to the Director, Universitii.tsbibliothek, Heidelberg; to the
Director and Restaurator of the Papyrus-sammlung, Osterreichische
Nationalbibliothek, Vienna; to Professor Samuel Lowinger, former
director of the Jewish Theological Seminary, Budapest, and to Pro-
fessor Alexander Scheiber, present director, who spared no effort in
providing me with photostats from the David Kaufmann Collection







preserved at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and helped me in
other ways; to Professor N. Pigulevskaya, director of the Near Eastern
dcpa1-tment1 and to Professor C. Starkova who heads the Hebrew sec-
tion of the Institut Narodov Azii (Institute of the Peoples of Asia),
Leningrad, for the use of the manuscripts under their care and for
many other kindnesses; to the Director, Saltykov-Shchcdrin State
Public Library, Leningrad, and Librarian Victor Lebedev; to the ad-
ministration and staff of the Jewish National and University Library,
Jerusalem, Israel; to the former and present librarian3 and the staff
of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York; to Profes-
sor Ricbard Ettinghausen of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York
University, for providing me with photographs and precious biblio-
graphical and other advice; to the President and Library staff of the
Dropsie College, Philadelphia; and, last but not least, to the staff of
the University Museum and the Van Pelt and Fine Arts libraries of
the University of Pennsylvania for manyfold help.
 My first three visits to the libraries of Europe were financed by
teaching in various summer schools there, with my spare time and
money going to Geniza research. This wasteful procedure (which,
though, was not wanting in interesting experiences) was eventually re-
placed by financial assistance granted to me. Besides the two univer-
sities in which I taught successively, the Hebrew University, Jerusalem,
and the University of Pennsylvania, both of which let me benefit from
time to time from their schemes for the advancement of research, these
institutions, foundations, societies, and private citizens have greatly
obliged me by their understanding and generosity: Alexander Kohut
Memorial Foundation; American Philosophical Society; Ecole Prati-
que des Hautes Etudes, VI" section, Division des Aires Culturelles
(formerly Centre de Recherches Historiques); Israel Academy of Sci-
ences; John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation; Lucius N.
Littauer Foundation; Siegfried and Irma Ullmann Foundation: Philipp
Brothers Foundation; Social Science Research Council; my friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Levy of London; Jacob I. Rosenbaum and Lionel
C. Rosenbaum, both of Cleveland, Ohio, and the late Emil Weitzner of
New York.
 The documents discussed in this book touch on many problems not
met with by me in my previous scientific work. While editing Geniza
texts and trying to interpret them I had to make myself familiar with
new fields of research. In this endeavor I was assisted by colleagues
near and far. I learned from many, including some much younger in
years. Here I can express my thanks only to those whose erudition and
helpfulness benefited this volume directly. D. H. Baneth, Professor
Emeritus of Arabic, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, is my master in
Geniza philology. I do not regard the edition of a text edited by me as
definitive until I have received his criticism. Professor Robert S. Lopez,
Yale, guided my first steps in the field of medieval economic history.







 Dr. George C. Miles, Chief Curator of the American Numismatic Soci-
 ety, by patiently answering my queries and providing me with material,
 introduced me to Islamic numismatics, a field in which I learned much
 also from Professor Paul Balog of Rome. Dr. Joachim 0. Ronall, econo-
 mist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and member of the
 faculty of the New School for Social Research, helped me with the
 history of banking and cognate subjects. Professors Joseph Schacht,
 Columbia University, Franz Rosenthal, Yale University, Claude Cahen,
 University of Paris, and S. M. Stern, Oxford University, enlightened me
 on diverse subjects of Islamic studies. On Egyptian realia I learned
 much from Professor Ahmad Fakhri, University of Cairo, the eminent
 archaeologist, and from a younger scholar from the same university,
 Professor Muhammad El-Garh. Professor Saul Lieberman, Rector, Jew-
 ish Theological Seminary of America, despite his many preoccupations,
 let hardly a week pass before answering the queries I frequently sub-
 mitted to him on questions of rabbinical law and literature. Professors
 S. Spiegel and M. Margalioth of the same institution, as well as Pro-
 :essors J. Schirmann and S. Abramson, Hebrew University, and Dr.
 N. Alloni of Jerusalem provided me with information concerning their
 work at the Taylor-Schechter Collection, Cambridge University, and
 other subjects. Professors N. Golb, University of Chicago, and A. Udo-
 vitch, Cornell University, read parts of the manuscript of this volume
 and made valuable suggestions. Of the galaxy of young men who worked
 as my scientific assistants I must mention three: Dr. Shaul Shakcd,
 the author of the indispensable Geniza bibliography (see Abbreviations
 and Symbols); Dr. L. A. Motzkin, whose Ph.D. dissertation, "The
 Arabic Correspondence of Judge Elijah and his Family: A Chapter in
 the Social History of Thirteenth Century Egypt" (University of Penn-
 sylvania, 1965) is based on Geniza documents; and Dr. Aaron Shaffer,
 today an Assyriologist, who was full of fruitful ideas when studying
 Arabic with me and who assisted me during an early period of the
 writing of this work.
Like medieval authors I feel inclined to conclude my preface with
 ~he cry of despair of the psalmist (19: 13): "Who can be aware of errors;
 guard me from hidden mistakes." This volume is based on more than
 six thousand passages from manuscripts often difficult to read. Despite
 all the efforts made in checking numbers and other details, I am not
 satisfied that I have succeeded everywhere. Any criticism or informa-
 tion about inaccuracies js welcome.
To finally conclude on a more optimistic note: I wish to extend my
 heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Terry Joseph, the guardian angel who
 watched over the preparation of the manuscript for the press, as well
 as to August Fruge and James Kubeck of the University of California
 Press for their most encouraging cooperation.

 Author's Note


 TECHNICAL LANGUAGE has been avoided throughout. The meaning of a
 few unfamiliar terms, such as N agid (the head of the Jewish community
 of Egypt, pronounced nagheed) or dirhem (a silver coin), can be es-
 tablished easily with the help of the General Index. Most of the dynas-
 ties and rulers mentioned are described in the Historical Survey, pp.
 29-42, or are otherwise presented to the reader.
The term High Middle Ages is understood here as more or less coin-
 ciding with the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods (969-1250), as opposed to
 the Late Middle Ages, beginning around 1250.
Present-day Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Lebanon,
 Syria, and so on, were not in existence as political units during the
 period covered in this book. These and similar place-names are used as
 geographical terms defining the territories occupied by those states
 in our time.
It was difficult to find an English equivalent for Arabic shaykh and
 Hebrew zaqen as used in the Geniza papers. Literally they mean "old
 man," but, preceding or following a name, they were the equivalent of
 our Mr., with the important qualification that the title normally was
 reserved for a respected person (see pp. 91, 132, and 152). It is rendered
 here as "the elder." Another common word hard to translate is 'attar,
 "perfumer," sometimes rendered also as "druggist.u His store, in which
 he carried culinary, cosmetic, and medical herbs, spices, and prepara-
 tions is called here "store of drugs" because "drugstore" would be mis-
 leading.
Quotations from the Bible are translated as they were understood by
 the writers of the letters in which they occur (evident in the context, or
 known through the general usage of the Geniza period).
Biblical names that appear in the document referred to in Hebrew
 are spelled in the accepted English way, such as Abraham, Jacob,
 Moses. They are transcribed phonetically when the original has an
 Arabic form, such as Ibrahim, Ibrahim, Barhiin, all standing for Abra-
 ham, Ya'qiib for Jacob, Musa for Moses. In the case of rarer biblical
 names, where there exists no consensus concerning the English spelling,
 the one nearer to the Hebrew original is adopted.
In frequently recurring Arabic names, the diacritical marks used to
 denote their exact pronunciation have been omitted: Fatimids,







 Ayyubids, Fustat, for .Fatimids, Ayyiibids, al-.Fustat. In the latter
 case, as in that of al-Qayrawan, the article also has been dropped.
The transcription of Arabic names and words follows the system
 adopted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, second edition, with the excep-
 tion that dj is replaced by j, and Ip by q.
For the transcription of Hebrew words a simple, standardized sys-
 tem has been adopted. Aiming at phonetical exactness would have been
 chimerical since we do not know precisely how the writers of the Geniza
 letters pronounced the Hebrew words and phrases they inserted in their
 speech. The words Kohen and Levi are printed without bars designating
 the length of their vowels, and Levi is spelled with v also when referring
 to the tribe called by that name.
The Arabic or Hebrew word for "son," when ocurring between the
 name of a person and that of his father, is always abbreviated as b.
 (pronounced (i) bn in Arabic and ben in He brew). When introducing a
 family name, the little word is invariably rendered with Ibn, although
 the manuscripts more often than not write bn, and not 'bn.
Concerning the Notes: All the reader needs for the understanding
 of the references to the manuscripts used is contained in the Abbrevi-
 ations and Symbols. One additional remark: Murad Michael's collec-
 tion of the papers of Nahray (see Abbreviations and Symbols) is quoted
 even in cases where, at the time of the preparation of this volume,
 Michael had not yet copied the document concerned, and a copy made
 by myself was used. Everywhere, the original manuscripts have been
 consulted. After Michael had completed his work, I discovered that a
 great many accounts and some other papers in the Geniza were in the
 handwriting of Nahray. This material is not quoted with the mark
 N ahray since it is not included in that collection.
As for the Arabic texts cited in the Notes, the reader is reminded
 that their authors did not speak classical Arabic, but Middle Arabic, a
 language in many respects cognate to the modern vernaculars (see p.
 15). Forms like ibn abu, which constitute horrible blunders according to
 classical grammar, were perfectly regular in the speech of the eleventh
 century. In some exceptional cases, for reasons of clarity, the classical
 final endings have been provided, although they were certainly dropped
 in actual speech. For the same reason, the l of the article has been re-
 tained throughout even when preceding the so-called sun letters (al-si'r,
 not as-si'r). Both hamza and alif wa~la are expressed by the sign '.






Abbreviations ancl Sy1nbols 1




 Jubilee, presentation, and memorial volumes are cited under the name
 of the scholar honored; for example, Arabic and Islamic Studies in
 Honor of Hamilton A. R. Gibb, ed. George Makdisi (Leiden, 1965) is
 cited as H. A. R. Gibb Presentation Volume {Leiden, 1965).
A plus sign after the shelf mark of a Gcniza MS means that the
 document has been edited and published or is included in S. D. Goitein 's
 India Book or M. Michael's Nahray (see below, s.v. India Book and
 Nahray). Publication data on the edition or the serial number of the
 document in India Book or Nahray is provided at the first appearance
 of the relevant shelf mark, for which the Index of Geniza Texts is to

 Introduction
The Cairo Geniza Documents as a Source of Mediterranean
Social History




Their discovery and transfer to libraries in Europe and America.-
 Students of the history of the Mediterranean countries during the
 Middle Ages have often complained about the almost complete absence
 of archives in Muslim countries. In Europe, the church, feudal lords,
 cities, and guilds kept their documents as titles of right and for other
 purposes. Nothing of the kind is to be found in Muslim countries in
 that period.1 It is possible now, to reconstruct the main lines of politi-
 cal history and, to a certain extent, also the life of the ruling class with
 the help of literary sources, supplemented by the study of extant
 buildings, utensils, inscriptions, and coins. But social and economic
 history, especially of the middle and lower classes, can hardly be
 studied without the aid of documents such as letters, deeds, or accounts
 that actually emanated from people belonging to these classes.
Under these circumstances it is most fortunate that a great treasure
 of records, hailing from all over the Mediterranean countries, and
 mainly from the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries, has been
 preserved in the so-called Cairo Geniza. The Hebrew word gen'iza
{pronounced gheneeza), like Arabic janiiza (which means "burial"), is
 derived from the Persian. In Persian, ganj denotes a storehouse or a
 treasure, and the closest meaning of its biblical derivative, especially
 in Ezra 6:1, is archive. In medieval Hebrew, geniza, or rather beth
 geniza, designates a repository of discarded writings. For just as the
 human body, having fulfilled its task as the container of the soul,
 should be buried, that is, preserved to await resurrection, thus writings
 bearing the name of God, after having served their purpose, should not
 be destroyed by fire or otherwise, but should be put aside in a special
 room designated for the purpose to await burial in a cemetery.
Similar beliefs were held by Muslims and medieval Christians,2 but
 the Jews were more consistent in this matter, presumably because
 Hebrew was regarded as God's own language. Soon the notion of
 holiness was transferred from the language to the letters, and scrupu-







 lous persons refrained from destroying anything written in Hebrew
 characters, even if ~he content was of a purely secular nature and even
 if the language used was other than Hebrew. There existed no uniform
 practice with regard to this; basically and generally, genizas were used
 for shemoth, writings bearing, or supposed to bear, the name of God.
Genizas were found in many countries where Jews lived. For reasons
 that are discussed later, only one gained momentous importance for
 historical research, the Cairo Geniza, the main repository of which was
 a lumber room attached to a synagogue in Fustat, or, as it is called
 today, Old Cairo. Fustat was the capital of Muslim Egypt down to
 969, when the Fatimids, after the conquest of that country, founded the
 town Cairo about two miles northeast of the former capital. During the
 whole of the Fatimid period (969-1171), Old Cairo remained the main
 city of Egypt and, even during the days of its decay and destruction, it
 was never entirely abandoned. The same was the case with the Geniza
 synagogue. Although its environment was mostly deserted, it never
 ceased to be a house of worship. In 1890, or perhaps the year before,
 the building was entirely renovated. During these operations, the roof
 of the Geniza chamber was torn down and its long concealed treasures
 laid bare.8
Even before this drastic change in the fortunes of the Geniza, some
 of the material preserved in it had been taken out, mainly, it seems,
 through the endeavors of the Jewish scholars in Jerusalem, one of
 whom had penetrated into the Geniza chamber as early as 1864 and
 given a detailed description of it in a book published two years later. 4
 A particularly studious collector-and seller-of Geniza manuscripts
 was Rabbi Solomon A. Wertheimer of Jerusalem, who also published
 some of them in the 1890's, although in a somewhat unscientific way.
In 1890, when Egyptian antique dealers and European scholars
 visiting Egypt became aware of the newly discovered treasures of
 Hebrew manuscripts, large quantities of Geniza material began to flow
 into public and private libraries in Europe and America. Neither
 dealers nor scholars, although for different reasons, were eager to
 disclose their source. In the early nineties, when heaps of dilapidated
 manuscripts and many leaves of ancient documents piled up on the
 desks of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, Iarge]y purchased from the
 Rabbi Wertheimer mentioned above, professional discretion did not
 permit the librarian to tell interested scholars where they had origi-
 nally come from. Thus, it was possible that the first, and one of the
 best, scientific publications of Geniza documents was made by a
 scholar who did not know of the existence of the Cairo Geniza. In 1894,
 Adalbert Merx published in his Documents de paleographie heb,·aique
 et arabe, with beautiful reproductions, eleventh- and twelfth-century
 deeds from the Geniza, which he had purchased in Cairo from a dealer
 and which he believed had come from family archives.15
Fortunately, almost all the Geniza manuscripts that were acquired







in and shortly after 1891 by American collectors, mainly from Phila-
delphia, were entrusted by them to the custody of Dropsic College for
Hebrew and Cognate Studies in that city. They are still there and were
described, although in a very preliminary way, in a printed catalogue. 6
A high dignitary of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Archimandrite
Antonin, v.-ho had his seat in Jerusalem, purchased many valuable
Geniza manuscripts of literary character and also some documents. His
collection is preserved in the Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library
of Leningrad. Another Russian, Arsenev, bought a number of Geniza
documents in Jerusalem in 1896, some of which are of great interest.
They are kept at present at the Institut Narodov Azii (Institute of the
Peoples of Asia) in Leningrad. 7 David Kaufmann of Budapest, who
was as great a collector as a scholar, early recognized the scientific
importance of those ancient, although often fragmentary or otherwise
damaged papers, and acquired a large quantity of them. After his
death they were presented by his family to the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences. 8
 Unlike David Kaufmann, some prominent scholars had doubts about
the value of the "Egyptian fragments," as the Geniza papers were
called in the early nineties. 9 One of the doubters was the man, whose
r:ame, more than that of any one else, is connected with "the discov-
ery" of the Cairo Geniza, Solomon Schechter, at that time Reader in
Rabbinics at the University of Cambridge, England, and subsequently
President of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York.
The archives of the Un1versity Library, Cambridge, have preserved
eloquent letters by Rabbi Wertheimer to Schechter, impatiently in-
quiring about the fate of the Egyptian manuscripts offered to him for
sale and urging Schechter to send them on to Oxford if he was not keen
on them. Schechter's little interest in the Geniza material at that time
is vividly demonstrated by the fact that the Geniza papers actually
acquired by the University Library in 1893-1894 were never even
provisionally classified by him, but left in boxes in a state that can-
not be much different from that in which they had arrived. 10
 The first European scholar who was granted direct access to the
Geniza chamber was that indefatigable traveler and collector, Elkan
N. Adler of London. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1888, he was
r;ermittcd, in January, 1896, to search the room for several hours and
 to take with him whatever he liked. His collection is one of the most
 valuable in existence and forms today one of the treasures of the
 renowned library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New
York.11
 In the same year, on March 13, 1896, there occurred that event
 which finally led to the liquidation of the Cairo Geniza, as far as
manuscripts are concerned, and the wholesale transfer of its remaining
contents to the University Library, Cambridge. On that day, two
learned Scottish ladies showed Solomon Schechter some leaves from the







Cairo Geniza recently acquired by them, and Schechter recognized in
one of them the Hebrew text of Ecclesiasticus, or Book of Wisdom by
Ben Sira. This book was written about 200 B.C. in Hebrew, but the
original had been lost and its content had been known only through
Greek and other translations. This startling discovery electrified
Schechter. If the Geniza contained one leaf in the original language of
such an ancient book, it stood to reason that a systemaUc search would
retrieve more of the same or of similar character. With the zeal of the
newly converted, and encouraged by Adler's recent success, Schechter
conceived the bold idea to save, with one stroke, the whole of the Cairo
Geniza for scientific research. He was fortunate in finding an ardent
supporter and Maecenas in Dr. Charles Taylor, Master of St. John's
College in Cambridge, and, equipped with letters of recommendation to
the Chief Rabbi and the President of the Jewish community in Cairo,
he arrived there in December, 1896.12
 Schechter's miss1on proved to be entirely successful. He had oppor-
tunity to search the Geniza not for hours 1 but for weeks, and he was
able to transfer to Cambridge a hoard of manuscripts of fabulous
dimensions. As far as documentary material is concerned, the Univer-
sity Library now possesses at least three times as much as all the other
collections together. Thus Schechter's fame as the father of Geniza
research is fully deserved. Later visitors to the Geniza chamber have
confirmed that nothing but printed matter remained. 13
 The University Library has done much to make this so-called Tay-
lor-Scl:echter Collection available to interested scholars. The papers
were cleaned and otherwise treated and put between glasses or bound
in volumes or arranged in boxes. Handlist.s briefly describing the con-
tents were prepared for the glasses and one section of the volumes.
These handlists were the work of the curator of Oriental manuscripts
Ernest J. Worman, whose early death in 1909 was a great loss to
Geniza research and seems to have brought to a premature end the
urgent work of classification. In 1955, with the newly aroused interest
in Geniza research, a New Series of the Taylor-Schechter Collection
was started under the direction of Librarian H. R. Creswick. Out of the
many lens of thot1sands of unclassified Geniza papers, the documen-
tary material was selected by me and is now conveniently accessible in
separate boxes. Some additional material of this type was assembled in
the 1960's by Professor Norman Golb of the University of Chicago, a
former student of mine. The far more numerous biblical and other
literary texts were classified by library personnel, and, as far as expert
work was involved, by a number of interested scholars, in particular
Professors Jefim Schirmann, Sheraga Abramson, and Nehemia Alloni
of Jerurnlem, Shalom Spiegel and Moshe Zucker of New York, and
Alexander Scheiber of Budapest. 14
 New Geniza material was unearthed in the Basatin cemetery east of
Old Cairo at the beginning of this century and was openly sold. In







1908, the comparatively small, but highly valuable collection of Geniza
documents now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, was acquired
by Charles L. Freer in Gizeh, a suburb of Cairo. Nothing is known
about the provenance of these papers, but it seems probable that they
had come from that famous old cemetery. The same might be true of
the Gcniza papers in the possession of the University Museum, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, which were purchased in Cairo in
1910. 15 During 1912 and 1913, more systematic searches were made in
the Basatin cemetery by Bernard Chapira of the Societe des Etudes
Juives of Paris assisted by Jacques Mosseri, the nephew of Joseph M.
Cattawi Pasha, the President of the Jewish community in Cairo, who
had already been so helpful to Solomon Schechter. Over 4,000 frag-
ments were found, the majority of which, however, lie outside the scope
of this book both as far as contents and periods of provenance are
concerned. This material is generally ref erred to as the Mosseri Collec-
tion.16
 The greatest of all coHectors of oriental Hebrew manuscripts, the
Karaite scholar Abraham Firkovitch (1786--1874), was reticent about
the origin of the treasures which he brought together in many years of
daring travels. Paul E. Kahle, who devoted a lifetime to the study of
the manuscripts of the Bible and other ancient Hebrew literature found
in the Firkovitch collections, was of the opinion that some of these
manuscripts (which were sold to the Imperial, now Public State, Li-
brary of Leningrad) must have come from the Cairo Geniza. An
examination of the documents from the eleventh through the fifteenth
centuries preserved in those collections, carried out in the summer of
1965, convinced me that there could be no doubt concerning their
provenance from that source. 17
 The history of the transfer of the Cairo Geniza to the libraries of
Europe and America explains the scattered state of this material
today. In addition to the five great collections in University Library,
Cambridge, Bodleian Library, Oxford, the British Museum, London,
Jewish Theological Seminary of America, New York, and State Public
Library, Leningrad, and in six medium-sized collections in Dropsie
College, Philadelphia, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest,
Presbyterian Westminster College in Cambridge, England, Library of
tbe Alliance Israelite Universelle, Paris, Freer Gallery of Art, Wash-
ington, and National Library in Vienna, there exist at least nine
others, 18 and some material is still in private hands. The valuable
collection of the Municipal Library in Frankfort on the Main, Ger-
many, was destroyed during World War II and not even handlists
indicating its contents have survived.
 Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that pages of one and
the same book, nay, fragments of one and the same document, should
have been found in such distant places as Leningrad, Cambridge, and
New York. There is little comfort in the fact that Greek as well as







Arabic papyrology are afflicted by similar handicaps.111 The inconven-
ience of geographical dispersion is aggravated by the fact that only few
collections have published catalogues, and those published are incom-
plete and insufficient for historical research. By far the most important
bibliographical guide to Geniza documents is Volume II of the Cata-
logue of Hebrew Manuscripts of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, pre-
pared mainly by A. E. Cowley and printed in 1906. Generations of
scholars have based their Genii.a studies on this volume. Still, when I
began to collect Geniza material about the India trade, I found only
one single pertinent detail indicated in the Catalogue, recognizable by
the name of an Indian seaport registered in the Index. After years of
search it appeared that the Bodleian collection of Geniza papers con-
tained no fewer than thirty-five items referring to the subject. There
was no way of establishing this other than actually ex-amining all the
manuscripts extant. If such a wasteful procedure was necessary with
regard to a collection described by a competent librarian, it is easy to
imagine what awaits a scholar in the many collections that provide no
bibliographical guidance whatsoever.
 Just as the manuscripts of the Geniza documents are not easily
accessible because of their geographical dispersion and lack of ade-
quate bibliographies, so is it extremely difficult to get hold of all the
printed material. Most of the Geniza documents were published in
scientific (and sometimes not so scientific) journals, many of which
were discontinued years .ago. For example, to whom would it occur to
search The Green Bag: An Entertaining Magazine of Lawyers (Bos-
ton) for Geniza manuscripts? At the turn of the century, however,
three of them were published there with facsimiles. 20 With the excep-
tion of a bill of divorce recently acquired by the Speer Library of the
Princeton Theological Seminary, these manuscripts, as it appeared
after examination, are preserved, at present, at Dropsie College, Phila-
delphia. The printed catalogue of the Geniza fragments in Philadelphia
 (cf. above, p. 3 n. 6), does not say a word about their publication in
The Green Bag, and I too, became aware of this fact only after I had
copied the manuscripts kept at Dropsie College and tried to under-
stand them. Many Geniza records are buried in jubilee and memorial
volumes or in books where nobody would suspect their existence. There
are valuable pub]ications in languages not widely known, such as
Hungarian. Thus it has sometimes occurred that one and the same
document was published by two different scholars each ignorant of the
other's efforts.21
 In order to put an end to this intolerable situation, a tentative
bibliography of all published Geniza documents has been prepared by
Dr. R Shaked under the direction of Professor D. H. Baneth of
Jerusalem and myself. Although this first trial perhaps may not have
achieved completeness, it is hoped that, as far as published material is
concerned, it will put historical Geniza research on firm ground.11







Geniza v. archive.-The nature of a Geniza hoard of manuscripts
 can best be illustrated by contrasting it with a type of collection of
 manuscripts, which for the historian fulfills a similar task of documen-
 tary evidence, namely an archive.
From the definition of .the term Geniza given above it is evident that
 it is the very opposite of an archive. In an archive one keeps documents
 in order to use them, if and when necessary. Therefore, much care is
 taken to preserve them well, and, in many cases, they are deposited in
 the archive immediately after having been made out. The opposite was
 the case with the Geniza. Papers were thrown away there only after
 they had lost all value to their possessors and consequently in most
 cases only a long time after they had been written. Even family letters,
 let alone business correspondence, would not have been deposited in a
 place accessible to everyone except after having been deprived of all
 relevance to contemporaries. Legal deeds, which conferred rights on
 their holders, had to be kept by them and their heirs often for genera-
 tions, before they could be disposed of in the Geniza chamber.
 There was another good reason for keeping a document a long time
 before throwing it into the Geniza. Paper was expensive so that free
 space on a document was normally used for all sorts of purposes, such
 as drafts, short notes, accounts, or even merely for trying out a pen or
 for exercises. Thus MS TS 16.49 of the University Library, "Cambridge,
 was drawn up in Fustat on April 26, 987. Although long and elaborate,
 it is just a release in which a widow confirmed to the family of her
 husband that she had received all that was due her according to her
 marriage contract. Thus, there was no particular need to keep this
 document for a very long time. Yet its reverse side was used for trials
 of the pen, one of which bears the date December 21, 1085, about a
 hundred years later than that of the original document.
 Naturally, during the many years that elapsed from the execution of
a document to its disposal, it deteriorated. The writing became faint,
 the paper was covered with dark-brown stains, it was damaged by
 holes, and often parts of it were torn away for various uses.
 To be sure, many types of paper found in the Geniza, as well as the
ink used on them, were of excellent quality, and the scribes of the
courts, the clerks of business houses, as well as scholarly persons in
general, mostly had a clear and often even a beautiful handwriting.
 MS TS 18 J 4, f. 18, represents a business letter sent from Aden in
 South Arabia to a port on the west coast of India. It was addressed to a
 Jewish merchant from Tunisia, who ran a bronze factory and did other
 business out in that distant country. The recipient, after having stayed
many years in India, returned to Aden in the autumn of 1149, but
 remained there and in the interior of Yemen for another three years.
Then, he had to make the long journey through the Red Sea, the
 terrible desert between it and the Nile River and, finally, on the Nile
from Upper Egypt to Cairo. Despite the humidity of the climate of







 India and of Aden and the hazards of the three journeys on sea and
 through the desert-and the more than eight hundred years that have
 elapsed since it was written-the letter is in perfect condition, with
 even the smallest dot and stroke clearly discernible.23
Unfortunately, such examples are the exception rather than the rule.
 Even in those Geniza papers that are more or less complete, the writing
 is often partly effaced, for example, by seawater, or otherwise dam-
 aged. Many Geniza papers are mere fragments, representing the begin-
 ning, middle, or end, or either side of a document. True, even small
 scraps of paper sometimes contain valuable information. Still, their
 incompleteness, often involving the loss of vital details concerning
 personalities, dates, and localities, is tantalizing and makes heavy
 demands on the memory and the synthesizing faculty of their student.
There is another difference between an archive and the Geniza which
 is a great obstacle to research. In an orderly archive, material of the
 same character is normally kept together in one place, which simplifies
 research on one topic. In the Geniza, everything is topsy-turvy. The
 dispersion and scrambling of the Geniza material caused by its transfer
 to the libraries of Europe and America did not create the total confu-
 sion in which it is found now, but only enhanced it. Today, even in the
 most carefully classified collections, those of the Bodleian Library in
 Oxford and certain sections of the Taylor-Schechter Collection in
 Cambridge, the most heterogeneous material is bound together in one
 volume. To cite just one example, in the comparatively small volume
 MS Heb. d 65 of the Bodleian, which contains only forty-four items,
 the subjects range from marriage contracts, bills of divorce, and legal
 deeds of the most diversified character to private and business corre-
 spondence and accounts, to end up with secular and religious poetry,
 one amulet, and a homily. The dates range from A.D. 956 to 1538,
 almost 600 years. The places, by chance, show less variety, but still
 comprise cities as distant from each other as Qayrawii.n in Tunisia and
 Damascus in Syria. If this is the condition of the Geniza material after
 its classification in a library, one can imagine its state of confusion in
 its original habitat. Solomon Schechter, who had actually seen it in
 that state, has preserved his impressions for posterity in a vivid and
 humorous description. a,,
This jumbling of the contents of the Geniza calls for comment, for
 there can be no doubt that Jewish families and communities kept
 archives. 25 Thus we find that the Geniza has preserved over 200 letters
 addressed to Na.bray b. Nissim, a prominent businessman, scholar, and
 community leader, who emigrated around 1045 from Tunisia to Old
 Cairo where he died fifty years later. A considerable number of other
 personalities and families are represented in the Geniza by so many
 papers that we are forced to assume that they were originally part of
 carefully kept collections. In business letters reference is ma.de regu-
 larly to correspondence of preceding years and to account books. In







many cases, pages from record books of courts, referring to successive
meetings during several years, such as 1027-1029, or 1097-1099, or
from notebooks of judges covering prolonge<l periods, have been pre-
served. Why, then, were these collections torn asunder in the Geniza
and mixed up with documents emanating from other persons, countries,
and centuries and with literary texts of the most variegated character?
 This chaos is to he explained, it seems, by the fact that, the Geniza
was in living use during the whole time of its existence. I remember
having seen in one collection a bill of divorce made out in Bombay as
late as 1879, and, as it is unlikely that a document of such character
was disposed of in faraway Cairo immediately after the legal act
attested by it, it is not impossible that it landed in the Geniza only a
few days before Solomon Schechter arrived in Cairo ready to carry it
off in its entirety. 26 The Jiving use of the Geniza was expressed not only
by the continuous addition to its contents, but also by the opposite
process. Enterprising people took the trouble to get into the dark room,
formerly in order to find an ancient prayer book, or even legal formu-
laries, or mere scrap paper, but later in the nineteenth century their
aim was to select manuscripts suitable for sale to Europeans and
Americans hunting for antiquities. The result of all this was that all
the contents of the Cairo Geniza were continuously and completely
turned upside down. In this state they were transferred to the libraries
in which they are deposited now, and, as far as papers of documentary
character are concerned, much of the old disorder has remained. 27
 The students of Greek and Arabic papyrology and of other papyri
unearthed in Egypt may be reminded of their own tribulations while
reading those tabulated here. The difference is this: The Greek and
other ancient documents, once covered with earth, normally remained
undisturbed, while those buried in the Geniza were never left in peace,
but were constantly called upon to satisfy the needs and greed of the
living. The results, as we have seen, were hardly beneficial.
 Types of documents, their numbers, scripts, and languages.-ln ad-
dition to fragmentation and other damage, as well as the confusion
wrought by the very process of the disposal of documents in the
Geniza. there is another factor that makes it so utterly different from
an archive: its erratic character, the entire absence of selection in the
material deposited in it. Alongside carefully worded and magnificently
executed deeds, one finds hastily written notes, accounts or letters,
jotted down in nearly illegible script and in sloppy or faulty language.
 The very shortcomings of the Geniza, however, constitute its unique-
ness and glory. It is a true mirror of life, often cracked and blotchy,
but very wide in scope and reflecting each and every aspect of the
society that originated it. Practically everything for which writing was
used has come down to us. In the following, the main tYpes will be
characterized. Examples of each category, translated into English, are
provided in Mediterranean People. 28







 The largest and most valuable group of Geniza documents is made
up of court depositions, either statements made or agreements reached.
They appear in three different forms, as drafts, as court records, or as
documents handed over to the people concerned. The declarations
made by the parties or witnesses are often rendered verbatim, while the
case itself would be stated succinctly and clearly by the scribe. Almost
every conceivable human relationship is represented in these records,
and they often read like local news told by a gifted reporter.
 Of legal deeds p.roper, the marriage contracts, many hundreds of
which have survived, are unusually interesting. They are by no means
stereotyped, but state in detail and with great variety the conditions
regulating the future relations of the newly married, and thus consti-
tute a precious source for our knowledge of family life. In addition,
they contain, or are accompanied by, detailed lists of the marriage
portion brought by the bride, her jewelry, clothing, bedding and other
furniture, her "copper' 1 and other household utensils, and often a bride
would a1so possess a house or houses or parts of a house, as well as one
or more maidservants. Often the price of each item is indicated. Need-
less to say, these lists are an invaluable aid for the study of the
material civilization of the period.
 Contrariwise, the bills of divorce, of which a great number has also
been preserved, are mere formularies. In them, only the names of the
divorced and the signatories, as well as the dates and places, are
sometimes of interest for social history. On the other hand, the settle-
ments reached between the divorced and the lists of the wife's posses-
sions restored to her are often very instructive.
 Marriage contracts were torn up after the wife had received every-
thing owed her in case of divorce or after the death of her husband.
Moreover, the contracts were usually written on large pieces of vellum
or paper and their reverse sides left blank. Therefore, when no longer
needed, they were often torn into pieces for scrap paper. To say that
nine out of ten marriage contracts in the Geniza are incomplete is an
understatement.
 Wills and deathbed declarations are disappointing insofar as they
consist almost exclusively of dispositions about property. In the Geniza
there are no ethical wills, a document so frequent in later centuries.
Yet, very often the last disposition of a person gives a clear idea not
only of his possessions, but also of his mind. For economic and social
history, of course, the wills are veritable mines of information, and so
are the inventories of estates, both of the rich and the poor. The many
booklists with or wi ~hout prices found in the Geniza are mostly enclo-
sures to such inventories of estates.
 Deeds of manumission of slaves and slave girls (only the latter are
frequent) are mostly stereotyped, but not without interest. Sometimes,
the manumission is included in a disposition on the deathbed.
 As for transactions in general, one of the most common types of







documents is releases, declarations by one or several persons renounc-
ing all claims against another or others. Many of the longest and best
preserved Geniza documents belong to this category. They are more
important for legal than for social history, as most of the wording is
legal terminology.
 Another type of document, the yield of which is in no relation to its
length, is the letter of attorney of which there arc many. These, too, are
mostly composed of legal phrases. Still, because they normally indicate
not only the persons and places involved, but also the subject matter
 for which the power of attorney is given, they are rarely without
interest.
 Deeds of sale or gifts of houses (more frequently, parts of houses)
and of slave girls, as well as leases of apartments or of land, are
common and naturally always contain some useful information. With
the exception of books, no contracts were made for the sale of goods. In
case of litigation, only letters and account books were produced and
witnesses called up.
 The constitution or dissolution of partnerships normally resulted in
interesting documents. On the other hand, loans and promises of pay-
ment of debts are mostly disappointing because as a rule the reasons
and other circumstances of the indebtedness are not stated.
 Very few contracts of employment have been preserved. The reasons
for this defect are twofold. First, even a poor laborer preferred to enter
into a partnership with a richer fell ow craftsman than to become his
employee. Secondly, when persons, especially younger ones, hired
themselves out as servants or as laborers, normally no written contract
was made.
 Turning now to correspondence, we find, as was to be expected, that
business letters form the largest and most important group. They are
our main source not only for our knowledge of commerce and industry,
but also for various other subjects, such as travel and seafaring.
Normally, a letter, especially when going overseas, deals with many
topics at a time: receipt and dispatch of goods, lists of market prices,
orders for new commodities, action taken or to be taken for or against
third persons, as well as references to private or public affairs. Business
was conducted on the basis of trust and friendship, wherefore business
letters are rarely without a personal touch.
 For this very reason there is no clear-cut demarcation between
commercial and private correspondence. Even in a letter of congratula-
tion to the addressee at his wedding, or in a letter of condolence-
again, especially when sent overseas-one finds paragraphs dealing
with financial matters, while business letters usually contain shorter or
longer references to the receiver's health, social status, family, and
friends. Nevertheless there are hundreds of letters of a purely personal
character covering, of course, a great variety of topics. Although only a
small fraction of the female population knew how to write (for this art







was normally practiced only by people engaged in business, adminis-
tration, or learning), many letters to and from women have survived.
 In many cases it is evident that the letters were dictated. We hear the
female voice guiding the male pen.
 Commerce, banking, and industry are further illustrated by ac-
 counts, inventories of stores and workshops, or of pawnshops, by bills
 of lading, promissory notes and orders of payment, while short notes of
many types, prescriptions, placards, horoscopes, charms and amulets,
 and exercise books written for or by children grant us additional
 glimpses into daily life.
 A large portion of the Geniza papers refers to public affairs. There
 are hundreds of letters addressed to various authorities containing
 reports, petitions, requests for help, demands for redress of injustice,
 applications for appointments, and a great variety of other matters.
 Less in number, but still preserved in considerable quantities, are
 letters emanating from authorities, such as instructions to communities
 or public officials, letters of appointment or of introduction or recom-
 mendation, certificates, decrees, bans, circulars, in particular those
 soliciting contributions to certain works of public charity, and, of
 course, exchanges of letters between one authority and another. Men-
 tion must be made also of the endless appeals by the heads of the
 academies or other institutions of higher learning for funds, or their
 letters of thanks and appreciation to the donors.
Of particular interest are the letters from communities large and
 small. We have statutes, public resolutions, and, in particular, many
 lists of contributors to a great variety of good public causes or of
 receivers of alms, clothes, or loaves of bread. These lists are priceless
 sources for the demography of the communities concerned. Another
 most valuable group of documents comprises the financial reports of
 honorary treasurers, or of persons fanning out the collection of rents,
 about the sums received from the houses and other property belonging
 to the community, the expenses on their upkeep and repair, and the
 emoluments of the officials and other persons on the payroll of the
 community.
As it was customary to say a public prayer for a meritorious per-
 son-and who was not?-and to commemorate in it his forefathers and
 their descendants, at least up to the sixth or se,·enth generation, many
 "memorial lists" have been found in the Geniza. Sometimes the prayer
 for the person thus honored is attached, but mostly the lists alone were
 written down. Their correct interpretation often presents no small
 difficulty, for they are mostly scribbled hastily and more often than not
 presuppose the knowledge of some details familiar to the members of
 the congregation but not to us. Still, despite their being sometimes
 cryptic or ambiguous, most of them are instructive in many respects.
At the present stage of research, it is impossible to state the exact
 number of Geniza papers of documentary character in existence. In







 order to give some idea of the size of the material in question, an
 estimate is offered, which is, however, of an entirely preliminary char-
 acter. If we exclude the many thousands that are mere scraps of paper,
 we arrive at the number of about 10,000 items of some length, of which
 around 7,000 are self-contained units large enough to be regarded as
 documents of historical value. Only about half of these are preserved
 more or less completely.
It should be emphasized that these numbers refer solely to papers of
 docu111,entary character, such as described in the previous pages. The
 leaves with literary contents-fragments of books preserved in the
 Geniza-number at least twenty times as much. A reasonable estimate
 would be 250,000 leaves, and this exclusive of the so-called Second
 Firkovitch Collection in the State Public Library of Leningrad, of
 which material it is likely that much has come from the Cairo Geniza.
 Compare this figure with the total number of Arabic papyri and papers
 unearthed in Egypt which Adolf Grohmann, the most competent au-
 thority on the subject, estimates to be around fifty thousand.29
It may be remarked in passing that the remnants of literature
 assembled in the Geniza are by no means confined to religious texts or
 to topics of specifically Jewish interest. They comprise practically all
 subjects on which medieval authors wrote books, ranging from philoso-
 phy and medicine to the interpretation of dreams and folktales. Natu-
 rally, most of the secular texts come from the orbit of the Islamic
 civilization. There are also others, though. Recently, a Germanic poem
 on Horant and Hilde was discovered (or, rather, rediscovered) by L.
 Fuks in the Taylor-Schechter Collection of the University Library,
 Cambridge, and edited in an important two-volume publication. The
 poem, which consists of over one thousand lines, was included, together
 with other Germanic poems, mostly on biblical themes, in a codex of
 eighty-four pages, dated 1382 and written, of course, in Hebrew
 script.30
It is not always possible to distinguish precisely documentary from
 literary texts. This is true in particular for the most common type of
 literature found in the Geniza, the so-called responsa, or "answers" of
 authoritative scholars on questions of religious, legal, or general char-
 acter addressed to them. The responsa and their Muslim counterparts,
 the fatwa's, or opinions of the muftis, were collected in books, which, in
 Judaism and Islam, fulfill a role similar to the collections of cases and
 decisions of high courts in English and American law, and, as their
 scope was wider, were of even more general importance. A considerable
 number of the responsa were purely theoretical. In these, usually one or
 more ancient texts were quoted by the questioner with the aim of
 getting an explanation of obscure or apparently contradictory pas-
 sages. But there are countless responsa in the Geniza which contain
 actual cases, and these, of course, are as valuable source material for
 social history as the other types of Geniza papers of documentary







 character surveyed. On the other hand, the two classes of questions
 usually were mixed up in the collections of responsa, and what we find
 in the Geniza mostly are not the original questions and answers, but
 fragments of books in which the answers of prominent scholars were
 reproduced, and often the authors of these books omitted all the legally
 irrelevant aspects of a case, such as dates, names of persons and places,
 and other local color, in other words those features that interest the
 social historian most. }'or this reason, and also because most of the
 ancient responsa have been published and their contents incorporated
 in publications, only sparing use will be made of them in this book. An
 exception will be made only for the responsa of Moses Maimonides
(1135-1204) and his son Abraham (1186-1237), not for the sentimen-
 tal reason that these two great masters actually made legal decisions in
 the Geniza synagogue, but because of the good luck that the full texts
 of the original questions and answers have been largely incorporated in
 the collections of their opinions, a fact we are able to check, as some of
 their autographed answers have also been preserved. 81
Another type of writing of half-documentary and half-literar y char-
 acter are the so-caJled rnegilloth, or scrolls, which, like the bibHcal
 scrolls of Ruth or Esther, describe fateful events or periods in the life
 of a person, a family, or a community. All the megilloth found in the
 Geniza are in Hebrew and obviously were intended to be works of
 literature, some being cast in rhymed prose. In any case, they do
 illustrate the society from which they emanated. The autobiography of
 Johannes-Obadiah, the Norman proselyte, rendered in extract in Medi-
 terranean People, is an example.82
The script of the Geniza documents, irrespective of the language
 used, is as a rule Hebrew. This is implied in the very definition of a
 geniza, as explained in the opening paragraphs of this Introduction.
 Many types of Hebrew script, varying according to the country, time,
 social class, and profession of the writers, are represented, and a
 careful study of their paleography is a prerequisite for any attempt at
 deciphering and correct interpretation. Very considerable quantities of
 writings in characters other than Hebrew, in particular in Arabic, are
 to be found among the Geniza documents, and not only in the frequent
 cases where the reverse side of an Arabic document was used for a text
 in Hebrew characters, but also when both sides bore a letter or another
 kind of writing exclusively in Arabic. The disposal of such pieces in the
 Geniza can best be explained by the assumption that they were kept
 originally in a family archive or a similar collection together with
 Hebrew writings, until the whole lot was thrown away by a member of
 an indiscriminating later generation. This assumption seems to be
 corroborated by the fact that sometimes an Arabic document is found
 which refers to the same subject matter as another in Hebrew letters.
Unlike Arabic script, the Arabic language prevails in most of the
 Geniza material of documentary character; in other words, the Jews,







who have left us the records of their daily life in the Geniza, mostly
wrote, as they talked, in one of the various Arabic vernaculars that
were then in vogue in Spain, Sicily, and in most of the countries of
northern Africa and western Asia. The use of the Hebrew script for this
purpose should not be surprising. The habit of writing in a script
hallowed by one's own religion was by no means confined to Jews.
Thus, the Syriac Christians wrote Arabic in Syriac. And when we find
that the Poles write their slavic language in Latin characters, while the
Yugoslavs use for theirs the Russian (Cyrillic) script, the reason for
this difference is simply that at the time of their becoming literate, the
former were Roman Catholics and the latter Greek Orthodox and each
adopted the script of the church to which they belonged.
 It should be noted that a great many of the nonliterary Geniza
papers were composed in the Hebrew language. To begin with, Euro-
pean Jews did not have other means of making themselves understood
in the East, and scholarly persons frequently used Hebrew in letters, in
particular in those that referred to communal and religious affairs.
Arabic was used, however, in most private and family letters, even
those written by religious dignitaries, in most official correspondence,
and in all business letters. In epistles of a more formal character, such
as applications or letters of condolence or congratulations, it was
customary to begin with a shorter or longer (and sometimes very long)
Hebrew preamble, which, however, consisted mostly of general, al-
though often artisticaJly contrived, and conventional phrases.
 The situation is more complicated as far as legal documents are
concerned. The ancient language of the Jewish courts was Aramaic,
which had been the international language of western Asia for 1,300
years before it was replaced by Arabic. In the tenth century, Aramaic
was not known well any more and the Jewish courts began to change
over to Hebrew, with which, of course, educated persons had always
been familiar. Many deeds and court records from the first half of the
eleventh century are composed in that language and their smooth and
rich style proves that the usage was general. Since it was required,
however, that the records should render verbatim the depositions made
in court, and since the spoken language was Arabic, the scribes slowly
acquiesced in using the Arabic.83 It is noteworthy that Hebrew lingered
on in the smaller towns of Egypt longer than in the large centers, the
reason being perhaps that the scribes in the smaller towns had not yet
learned the relevant Arabic terms and style for making out a proper
legal document in that language. By the end of the eleventh century
and throughout the whole of the twelfth, Arabic was used practically in
 all transactions of the Jewish courts which have reached us. Then,
around 1200, Hebrew begins to reappear, perhaps because of the in-
 creasing influx of Jews from Europe, or because Moses Maimonides
 had written his code of ,Jewish law in a lucid, flexible Hebrew, which
 could serve as a model to the scribes of the courts. 14







The Arabic used in the Geniza records is by no means a particular
 Jewish dialect, but represents the language of the time and the country
 and social group to which the writer belonged. This can be proved by
 comparison with contemporaneous Arabic writings, especially those of
 Christian Arabs and Muslim popular literature, especially of a later
 period. (It always takes some time before the language of every day is
 allowed to creep into the literary style.) Hebrew words and phrases
 were inserted only very sparingly, mainly religious and legal terms, but
 also proverbial expressions and sometimes certain characteristic turns
 of speech that. the Hebrew but not the Arabic language seemed to
 possess. Still, the Arabic of the Geniza records somehow is a world by
 itself, because the very fact that it was written in a script other than
 that of classical Arabic by persons who had not in their childhood
 memorized the Koran, the holy book of Islam, made for greater inde-
 pendence from the traditional grammar and vocabulary. Therefore the
 Geniza papers reflect the living language, and they constitute, in their
 great variety of styles and local idioms, a first-rate source for the
 history of the Arabic language. In addition, the Hebrew script often
 brings out features that the Arabic script is unable to express, which
 means that the pronunciation of many words, as it was in vogue in the
 eleventh or twelfth century, becomes established through their tran-
 script into Hebrew. 35 A similar service was done to the Arabic lan-
 guage, in a later period, by transliteration into Latin characters.
Needless to say, these documents contain many riddles for the
 scholar, for he encounters words not to be found in any dictionary and
 linguistic usages unknown to classical grammar. The solution is often
 to be found in the Arabic dialects of our own time. Thus I would not
 have been able to understand certain terms and expressions common in
 letters written in Aden and India during the twelfth century had I not
 devoted much time to the study of Arabic as it is spoken in Yemen
 today.36 Another important help is-the Geniza itself. Many obscure
 words and usages find their explanation when they occur a second or
 third time. A final aid is the very character of the people speaking to us
 in the Geniza: the eloquence and lucidity of speech of the Mediterra-
 nean man guide the puzzled scholar even where he treads on unfamiliar
 linguistic ground.37
The times and countries of origin of the Geniza documents.-ln
 attempting to define with more precision the times and countries from
 which the documents used in this book originated, we are confronted
 with a number of perplexing phenomena. As shown at the end of this
 section, the fixing of these details themselves does not present unsur-
 passable difficulties. It is, however, not self-evident, why we should
 have so much material from certain times and countries, while from
 others we have next to none. Explanations are offered with regard to
 most of the puzzles, but they should be regarded as tentative, so long as
 they are not confirmed by the express testimony of our sources.







The first strange fact demanding and perhaps defying an explana-
 tion is the very existence of the Cairo Geniza. Since its discovery it has
 been commonplace to say that of the many genizas in the world, that
 of Fustat, or Old Cairo, has survived thanks to the dry climate of
 Egypt. While it is true that the climatic factor has contributed to the
 preservation of the Oeniza of Fustat, it by no means sufficiently
 explains why only this one should have remained. Fustat itself had
 not one, but three, synagogues; nearby Cairo had another one shortly
 after its foundation and many others later on.38 About seventy-five
 towns and villages in Egypt are known from the Geniza as places
 where Jews were settled. Moreover, certain regions in southern Pales-
 tine and in the countries of North Africa have a dry climate similar to
 that of Egypt. But from nowhere outside Fustat has anything com-
 parable to the Cairo Geniza been found.
Even more so. As explained on page 1, above, the contents of a
 Geniza chamber were normally removed to a cemetery to make room
 for other discarded books and writings. This was a general Jewish
 custom. Life magazine of October 24, 1960, page 70, carried a full-page
 photograph showing the interment of prayerbooks and other worn-out
 religious objects by a group of orthodox Jewish youngsters in Washing-
 ton, D.C., explaining that the famous Dead Sea Scrolls also came from
 a geniza (which is, however, doubtful). In Jerusalem, as late as the
 nineteenth century, it was customary to empty the genizas every
 seventh year and also in a year of drought, for it was believed that the
 burial of dried-out sacred books was conducive to the precipitation of
 heavenly moisture. 39 As a result, no old material was found in any of
 the genizas of Jerusalem, despite the careful searches made under the
 direction of the late Dr. J. L. Magnes, the first chancellor of the
 Hebrew University. 4° For the same reason, and to the disgust of E. N.
 Adler, the widely traveled connoisseur of books, even the "huge Ge-
 niza" of the famous ancient synagogue of Aleppo in northern Syria
 contained nothing but late printings. "Though the dust was more acrid,
 and the work far dirtier than that of Fustat, the matrix was modern,
 and the dir~ not pay dirt." 41 In Old Cairo, however, the very building
 of the Geniza was of such a size that it was able to hold its contents for
 a thousand years, and it was constructed in such a way that it could
 not serve any other purpose than that for which it was destined: a
 room with no doors or windows and with only one hole in the wall
 beneath the roof, which could be reached only by a ladder. All this
 seems to indicate that those who er,ected the Geniza chamber and those
 who used it in its early period must have entertained particular ideas
 about the disposal of Hebrew writings and it was due to these that so
 much ancient material has been preserved. So far, however, the Geniza
 has not revealed any direct evidence for such ideas.
Who were these people? Around 1000, the Jews were divided into two
 groups, the major being formed by the so-called Rabbanites-those







who followed the teachings of the rabbanim or rabbis-and the minor
by the Karaites, who professed to rely on the Bible alone. The Rab-
banites were subdivided into Palestinians and Iraqians (also called
Babylonians). Palestinian Rabbanites were communities whose mem-
bers had originally come from Palestine and Syria, whose service was
conducted according to the liturgy accepted in Palestine, and whose
officials were appointed and communal leaders approved by the reli-
gious authorities who had their official seat in Jerusalem. Babylonian
Rabbani.tes stood in the same relationship to Iraq and the Jewish seats
of learning in that country. All three sections mentioned possessed
houses of worship in Old Cairo. The Geniza chamber was attached to
the synagogue of the Palestinians. It is therefore necessary to devote
special attention to them.
 In 882, when the Coptic patriarch was forced to pay a heavy contri-
bution to A}.imad Ibn 'fuliin, the ruler of Egypt, he sold a church that
originally had been Melchite, that is Greek Orthodox, together with
some land, to the Jews, who converted it into a synagogue. It has been
generally assumed that this was the Geniza synagogue. A careful weigh-
ing of the available evidence seems to show, however, that the Coptic
church was acquired by the newcomers from Iraq who had no house of
worship of their own, while the synagogue of the Palestinians was prc-
Islamic, as reported by Muslim historians.42 Be this as it may, next to
no documents from the ninth century have come down to us in the
Geniza, and only a few dozen from the tenth.43 Perhaps the particular
idea of a permanen~ geniza had not yet been born or else we have to
seek an explanation for this deficiency in the subsequent history of the
building. Around 1012, the Fatimid caliph al-~akim ordered the de-
struction of the Christian and Jewish houses of worship, including the
Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and, as we know positively, the synagogue
 of the Palestinians of Fustat was demolished and its bricks and timber
were sold. Thus, if a geniza was attached to it at that time, it could
 hardly have survived.
 A few years after that religious persecution, permission was given to
 repair the desecrated buildings and an inscription on the entrance to
 the synagogue of the Palestinians, mentioned by various medieval
 writers, enables us to fix the year 1025 as the date of its restoration.u
 There is little doubt that the geniza chamber was added during that
 restoration, for, from 1002 on, we have dated documents for almost
 every year, and by the twenties of the eleventh century a very sizable
 quantity. This goes on uninterruptedly for about two hundred and fifty
 years until 1266, when dated documents begin to become rarer. As is
 well known, on December 22, 1168, Old Cairo was put to fire at the
 command of the Fatimid vizier, who dreaded its capture by the .ad-
 vancing Crusaders. For 54 days, the city was ablaze. But this confla-
 gration, albeit referred to in Geniza documents, did not cut off the
 supply of material from this source. Dated documents are as frequent







after it as they were before. In 1265 great fires again devastated the
city. This time, local Christians were accused of having caused them
and the Sultan ordered the burning of the Christians and, for complete-
ness' sake, of the Jews as well. As usual, the punishment was converted
into a heavy fine. A moving story, how the poor Jews from the
countryside helped their brethren in the capital to pay the fine, is to be
found in a document from Minyat Zifta. 45 It seems, unlikely, however,
that it was this event that caused the sudden drop of documentary
material in the Cairo Geniza. Similarly, it is difficult to see why so few
dated documents have been preserved from the fourteenth century and
even less from the fifteenth. To be sure, the majority of the Jewish
population moved in that period to Cairo, where we find, around 1400,
four synagogues as against three in Fustat. The letters addressed by
the Nagid Joshua, the great-great-grandson of Maimonides, to the
community in Fustat around 1350, show how destitute it had become,
while, at the same time, incessant demands were made on the charity
of its members.46 Yet, Fustat was still a large city, half the size of
Paris, according to the Belgian traveler Georges Lengherand, who
visited it in 1486,47 and in two Geniza papers dated 1482 and 1496,
respectively, Cairo is still defined as "situated near Fustat of Egypt,"
just as was done by the notaries five hundred years before. 48 It is
interesting to observe that in the type of paper used, in script, and in
legal formularies these late documents still resemble the deeds of the
classical period of the Geniza, although their workmanship is poor and
the care taken in their execution limited.
 Then everything suddenly changes. Dated documents begin to ap-
pear again in greater quantity from the second quarter of the sixteenth
century on, but then the paper obviously is no longer locally made, but
European; the script is entirely different; it is Spanish-Jewish; the
language, as a rule, is Hebrew and no longer Arabic, in some cases,
even Ladino, the Castilian dialect used by the Spanish Jews. In other
words, the Jewish East was completely overwhelmed by the refugees
from Spain, who had to leave their country in 1492 and became
prominent in the Ottoman Empire shortly afterward, just as in modern
times the Jewish East became assimilated to the emigrants and refu-
gees from eastern and middle Europe.
 This book is solely concerned with what has just been termed as the
classical Geniza, that is, documents that appear in a trickle during the
second part of the tenth century and become a flood for the subsequent
two and a half centuries. This means for Islamic history that the
Geniza is a primary source for social and economic history during the
Fatimid and Ayyubid periods and, as far as European history is
concerned, for the century preceding the Crusades and for Crusaders'
 times themselves.
 As to the eountries of origin of the Geniza material, naturaUy Egypt,
 where the Geniza was situated, provided most, especially as far as







 deeds are concerned. The situation is somewhat different with regard to
 letters, accounts, and related matters, while the scholarly correspond-
 ence of the responsa (cf. above, pp. 13 ff.) originated mostly outside
 Egypt. At that time, Jews lived not only in the capital and the port
 cities of Alexandria, Rosetta, and Damietta, but were dispersed all
 over the Nile delta, the Fayyiim oasis, and Upper Egypt. Letters and
 legal documents from many of the smaller places have found their way
 into the Geniza which thus is illustrative of life in Egypt in general.
 Whether the population reflected in these writings was indigenous to
 the country, that is, whether it represented a continuation of the
 Jewish settlements in Egypt in Hellenistic and Roman times, or origi-
 nated mainly after the Muslim conquest, this is a problem for which no
 clear-cut solution has been found thus far. 49
Since the Geniza belonged to the synagogue of the Palestinians, it
 stands to reason that many documents coming from or referring to the
 Holy Land should be found in it. This is, indeed, the case. There are
 also a considerable number of letters sent from the coastal towns of
 Lebanon and Syria, but written mostly by foreign merchants and not by
 local people. Astonishingly little, comparatively, is the material from
 Damascus and from Aleppo, the two great cities of Syria. Considering
 the close commercial relations of these cities with Egypt and the fact
 that so many people called Dimashqi and l;Ialabi (Damascene and
 Aleppian) appear in the Geniza papers, one wonders, whether these
 people were in the habit of disposing of their letters in genizas at all.50
The most surprising feature in the contents of the Geniza, as far as
 its geographical distribution is concerned, is the overwhelming pre-
 ponderance in it of people from Tunisia and Sicily, especially from the
 time of its inception around 1000 down to the last quarter of the
 eleventh century. At least 80 percent, but most probably more, of all
 the business correspondence in this period comes from them. One indeed
 gets the impression that the Geniza originally served the Maghrebi
 merchants who commuted from the western to the eastern part of the
 Mediterranean and partially settled there. This basic fact had neces-
 Rarily remained concealed until it was possible, through cross references
 in about four hundred letters and other documents, to establish the
 identity of the persons mentioned in them. In particular, it became
 evident that, in many cases, persons bearing family names such as
 Andalusi, Fasi 1 Taherti 1 or Itrabulusi, did not come from Andalus-
 Spain, or Fez and T!i.hert, Morocco, or Tripoli, Libya, but had their
 base in the Tunisian twin cities of Qayrawiin and al-Mahdivya. Like-
 wise, it could be proved that most of the people writing during this
 period from the smaller places all over Egvpt, where flax and indigo,
 the staple export crops, grew, were merchants from Tunisia. 51 Thus
 it seems that the Tunisians were the initiators of the idea of the perma-
 nent Gen1za, and, in particular, of the widening of its scope to comprise







entirely secular matters. Tunisia was at that time a great seat of Jewish
learning, and it may well be that one of the leading scholars there in-
structed his flock to this effect. Beginning with the last quarter of the
eleventh century, the use of the Geniza for secular correspondence be-
came more widespread, but the preeminence of the Maghrebis is still
felt during the first half of the twelfth century, especially with regard
to trade with India.fj 2
 Fortunately, some recently identified documents enable us to explain
the close connection of the Maghrebi merchants with the synagogue of
the Palestinians in Old Cairo. Shortly after the churches and syna-
gogues in the Fatimid empire had been destroyed during al-I;Iakim's
fit of religious insanity (see above, p. 18) 1 permission was given by him
to rebuild them. As we know from a number of Geniza papers, as well
as from Christian sources, the afflicted communities experienced great
difficulties in raising the funds needed for reconstruction. In this time
of hardship, the leaders of the Palestinian synagogue hit upon an ex-
pedient, often adopted also by modern community leaders: they ad-
mitted the Maghrebis, by which mainly the Tunisian and Sicilian mer-
chants were meant, to public offices and showered upon them honorific
titles, confirmed in bombastic letters, sent from the seat of the Academy
in Jerusalem. The stratagem was successful; the Maghrebis joined the
Palestinian synagogue and soon became its most prominent members. 55
As impressive as the abundance of Geniza material for Tunisia and
Sicily is its dearth in respect to Spain. If we disregard responsa and
epistles emanating from, or addressed to, prominent personalities-
both of which were collected and copied as pieces of literature and are,
of course, important sources of historical information-we would find
only about three dozen letters that have been identified, so far, as being
written in Spain, and even fewer documents. 54 But the products of
Spain filled the markets of Egypt, and there was much direct traffic
between the two countries. Moreover, many persons called Andalusi
and actually hailing from the Iberian peninsula are mentioned in the
Geniza papers. Why, then, do we not find with regard to the Spanish
merchants anything comparable to the wealth of information we have
for those originating from Tunisia and Sicily? This deficiency might
:find some explanation in the technique of international trade (see p.
213, below). But considering the ancient and lasting allegiance of
Spanish Jewry to the Jewish seats of learning in Babylonia, we are
 perhaps justified in assuming that the Spanish Jews sojourning in Egypt
 were connected with the synagogue of the Iraqians of Old Cairo and
 left their discarded writings in a geniza there, if they were wont to do
so at all. That synagogue, which was still fully in use in the sixteenth
 century, has since entirely disappeared."
A similar assumption may explain also the almost complete absence
of private and business correspondence with Iraq and Persia. As is seen







 in chapter i, many persons from those countries settled in Egypt and
 we can prove that some were newcomers. Still, only very few have left
 letters received from their countries of origin in the Geniza.
It would be rash to attribute this scarcity of documentary material
 from Iraq and Persia to the political situation, namely to the fact that
 these countries were under the sway of the Seljuks, who paid homage to
 the Abbasid caliphs, while Egypt was ruled by their adversaries, the
 Fatimids. For we have in the Geniza an enormous amount of letters,
 responsa, and other writings from the Jewish academies of Iraq; in-
 deed, they form one of its main constituents. These responsa and other
 writings were sent from Baghdad to North Africa and Spain and even
 to Italy and France via Old Cairo and often were copied there before
 being forwarded. This explains why we find them in the Geniza:
 Conversely, contributions were sent from Egypt to Baghdad, accompa-
 nied by letters and queries, which also were copied in Old Cairo, before
 being forwarded. Thus, political barriers cannot account for the pau-
 city of private documents from the Seljuk domain. The volume of
 trade between these countries and Egypt seems to have been limited,
 but was by no means so small as to explain the virtual absence of
 business correspondence between them in the Cairo Geniza. Thus we
 are again thrown back on the assumption that the merchants from Iraq
 and Iran disposed of their disused correspondence in the geniza of their
 own synagogue-again, if they were in the habit of doing so at all.
The situation was again different with regard to western Europe and
 the Byzantine Empire. Reference is not made here to persons from the
 orbit of Islamic civilization who happened to stay or to live in one of
 these countries, such as the doctor from Silifke, whose delightful letter
 of July, 1137, was written in Arabic, the language of his country of
 origin.68 As far as the local people are concerned, we have correspond-
 ence from them on spiritual matters, public affairs, and works of
 charity, but no business letters. Since we read in the Geniza papers
 frequently about commercial relations with Europeans, this deficiency
 is rather puzzling. An explanation is attempted in chapter i.
Having arrived at the end of this survey, we have to make good the
 promise given at its start and to explain, how and with what degree of
 certainty we are able to fix the times and places of origin of a Geniza
 paper.
In a proper document, of course, the location and date are indicated.
 In the event that these details are effaced or torn away, or with regard
 to a dran or a copy that was not filled in completely, we are still able,
 if the document is long enough, to gauge its approximate date and
 place of origin, for the handwritings of the more prominent scribes of
 the eleventh and twelfth centuries are known to us, and often the
 subject matter, names, geographical details, and accompanying cir-
 cumstances enable us to fix the desired data with great precision.
With letters it is far more difficult. Very often the place of destina-







tion and still more frequently the place of writing were omitted. As
letters were sent by messenger or with friends, one could well forego
these details. If dated at all, only the day and the month were indi-
cated, but only in exceptional cases (perhaps in one out of fifty) the
year. The name of the addressee usually was given in full, but the
writer often designated himself solely with a general phrase, such as
"your grateful friend," "your son," "your brother,'1 the latter phrases
mostly indicating a social, rather than a family, relationship. Formal
accounts were headed by a superscription, but very often we have only
a second or third leaf and naturally, many of the accounts found-
indeed the majority-are but notes made by the writer for his own use.
 If, in spite of these handicaps, we are able to approximate the
location and date of at least four-fifths of all the longer pieces pre-
served, this is owing to the fact that originally whole bunches of papers
were deposited together in the Geniza. As noted, the contents of the
Geniza were continuously jumbled and, at the end, dispersed in many
libraries all over the world. Where we succeed in uniting the scattered
parts of a unit, however, we often find that one fragment explains
another, and often several fragments taken together provide us with
means to fix their time and place of origin. There are many ways to
find out where a piece belongs and to what its details refer. The
interpretation of an ancient account, attempted below, pages 339-343,
can give an idea of the technique applied.
 The basis of all this is, of course, that we are familiar with the
persons and things prevalent during the classical period of the Geniza.
As far as the Mediterranean area is concerned, card indexes containing
the names of about 350 more and 3,200 less prominent persons, those of
about 200 better-known families, 450 professions, and about the same
number of goods form the means for preliminary identification. The
list of persons of lesser importance could easily be doubled. After this
and similar work is done, we shall be able approximately to place
almost any document of some length found in the Geniza.
 Research on the Cairo Geniza documents and their value for social
history.-The card indexes mentioned in the preceding paragraph have
been prepared mostly from unpublished documents. It would not have
been possible to do this, had not previous research on the Geniza
created the historical framework of the period, so that it was compara-
tively easy to fit into it the details concerning social and economic life.
 It was a happy coincidence that the Geniza was discovered near the
turn of the century when Oriental and Jewish studies had reached an
unprecedented peak. First-rate scholars used their unique knowledge to
identify, or to put into their historical contexts, the literary pieces that
came to light, as well as to fix the sequence and mutual relationship in
which unknown or little-known personalities or institutions stood to
each other. There were no Geniza specialists before World War I, but
many of the most important texts were printed and many of the basic







 facts about their contents were established between 1896 and 1914. The
 great achievements of this period of Geniza research are evident from
 Shaked's Bibliography.51
It was soon recognized that sporadic publication of particularly
 interesting documents or texts was not a satisfactory approach to the
 study of the Gcniza. Solomon Schechter planned a systematic corpus, 58
 hut, being preoccupied, as of 1902, with his new tasks as President of
 the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, he was
 unable to devote much time to the project. After his death, there
 actually appeared three volumes of literary texts, most of which he
 himself had selected for publication:'9 The fourth volume, which was to
 contain historical material, never came out. The reason for this is
 easily understood. Documents, in order to make sense, have to be read
 in their historical context. They cannot be merely "published"; they
 must first be studied together with the greatest possible number of
 documents of similar character. Their significanl'e, and often their
 mere meaning, become evident only after prolonged comparative
 study. It was the late Jacob Mann of the Hebrew Union College,
 Cincinnati, who undertook this arduous task.
Jacob Mann was a student of Jewish history. He confined himself
 mainly to letters written in Hebrew and deaHng with Jewish communal
 affairs. Who were the communal leaders in each period and place, what
 were their relations amongst tl1emselves, as well as between them and
 the various governments and the local authorities? These were the
 questions that interested him and to whieh he tried to find the answers.
 A lengthy stay in England gave him the opportunity to study the four
 main Geniza eollections in Cambridge, Oxford, the British Museum,
 and Elkan X Adler's library which was later sold to the Jewish
 Theological S<'minary of Ameril'a, New York. The result was his book,
 The Jeu·s in Egypt and in Palestine under the Fatimid Caliphs (Ox-
 ford, 1920 and 1922). the first volume of which contains a consecutive,
 although somewhat diseonnerted, narrative, while the second provides
 a very large selection of texts. Mann did not intend to provide a
 definitive edition of those texts-in many cases, only a short passage
 out of a long document is given, and those printed in full sometimes
 need revision. Therefore, historians, let alone linguists, who want to
 make use of this volume for exact research, are advised always to
 provide themselves with a photostat of the original. But Mann's book
 will remain a classic as long as the Geniza is studied.
The Jews ... under the Fatimid Caliphs, although a noteworthy
 achievement in itself, was only a beginning. Mann continued to pub-
 lish important Geniza material bearing on Jewish communal and lit-
 erary history and crowned his efforts with the publication of a 700-page
 yo)ume of Geniza texts <'ailed Te:rts and Studies in Jewish History and
 Literature, Vol. I {Cincinnati, 1931). Here, too, the subject is mainly
 communal and literary history, but, attention is paid also to social life,







 and, unlike Mann's first book, his Texts and Studies contains quite a
 number of texts in Arabic. 60 In addition to the mass of material made
 accessible by Mann, it was his constant endeavor to place the informa-
 tion gained from the Geniza geographically and chronologically which
 makes his publications so valuable. His lasting merit is to have created
 the historical framework for all future study of the documentary
 Geniza.
Of an entirely different character was the work of the late Simha
 Assaf of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, who also devoted a life-
 time to Geniza studies. He came to this field of research from two
 different angles. First, like his meritorious friend Benjamin M. Lewin,
 he was devoted to the study of the literature produced by the Geonim,
 or heads of the Jewish academies of Babylonia (Iraq), who were the
 acknowledged spiritual leaders of the Jewish community during the
 Arab period down to the eleventh century.
These leaders were approached by Jewish scholars from all over the
 world with theoretical and practical questions. The answers of the
 heads of the academies, the responsa, which were often given after long
 deliberations with their members, form thus not only an important and
 authoritative part of Jewish religious literature, but are also a source
 for the social history of the Jewish communities during the High
 Middle Ages (cf. above, p. 13) .61
Since the invention of printing, many collections of Geonic responsa
 have been published, but the texts usually were abridged and, as far as
 they were in Arabic, translated into Hebrew. A first and most valuable
 edition of original Geonic responsa was made by A. Harkavy in 1887
 on the basis of four manuscripts from the Second Firkovitch Collection
 of the Imperial Library in St. Petersburg (Leningrad), whose contents,
 we now know, most probably stem largely from the Cairo Geniza.62
 After "the discovery" of the latter in 1896, countles&-according to
 Assaf, thousands-of such responsa have come to light. Of the many
 publications before World War I, the most distinguished was Geonica
 (2 vols.) by Louis Ginzberg (New York, 1909). He was followed by S.
 Assaf, who, between 1927 and 1942, published four volumes of Geonic
 responsa from the Cairo Geniza; mainly from manuscripts preserved in
 Leningrad and Cambridge. At the same time Benjamin M. Lewin
 planned and began the publication of a huge commentary on the Tal-
 mud formed by quotations from Geonic responsa, also taken largely
 from Geniza material.
Another factor in Assaf 's Geniza studies was his interest in social
 and cultural history. He had published, in 1925, a first volume of a
 source book for the history of Jewish education {the fourth and final
 volume came out in 1948), and wrote a great number of studies on
 subjects as different as "Jewish Criminal Law in Post-Talmudic
 Times," "History of the Jews in Malta," "Family Life of Byzantine
 Jews." No wonder that the documents of the Cairo Geniza attracted







 his attention. The documents referring to social life are mostly in
 Arabic, a language with which Assaf was not familiar. Thus there
 developed a sort of cooperation between him and the members of the
 School of Oriental Studies of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and,
 in particular its Professor of Arabic, D. H. Baneth, which was most
 conducive to the furthering of the study of the Geniza documents
 written in the Arabic language. Baneth either deciphered and trans-
 lated the documents in question himself or corrected those worked on
 by others. It was, however, not only his dealing with the individual
 documents, but his methodological approach to the treatment of texts
 written in medieval Arabic, which made Baneth's contribution so sig-
 nificant. As explained above, page 16, these texts are not written
 according to the rules of classical grammar; therefore, a scholar deal-
 ing with them has first to find out what degree of colloquialism is
 apparent in them, in other words, what was the actual language of
 their writers? A "mistake" is only a deviation from the normal lan-
 guage of each individual. Many phenomena that appear to be gross
 blunders to a scholar reared on classical grammar were perfectly
 "normal" and in general use. It is the task of the student of medieval
 texts to make himself acquainted with that usage and to interpret each
 individual text in its light.
In addition to his linguistic commentaries to the texts published,
 Bancth has written special studies about the strange ways of this
 language and created what could be called the Jerusalem school of the
 students of medieval Arabic. 63 A former student of his, Professor
 Joshua Blau, wrote a grammar of nonliterary medieval Judeo-Arabic
 texts, and explained the emergence and nature of this vernacular,
 which is one of the best-known examples of Middle Arabic, in a series
 of important studies.M
Although Assaf w.as interested in social history in general, he had an
 Arabic text translated only when the names of significant persons or
 places occurring in them or other indications forecast a particularly
 interesting publication. A systematic perusal of the whole documentary
 Geniza for the purpose of social studies was not yet envisaged. This is
 the task incumbent upon the present generation.
"Business letter, and therefore valueless"-this remark about a Ge-
 niza paper, appearing in the printed catalogue of a most distinguished
 library about thirty years ago-betrays the attitude of former genera-
 tions. Things not connected with theology or literature or, at least,
 referring to a famous personality, were not regarded as worthy of the
 attention of a serious scholar. Today we believe that we cannot afford
 to neglect any type of writing which has come down to us, for life is
 one single undivided unit, wherefore we cannot form a proper idea of
 the spiritual aspirations of a society if we do not pay some attention
 also to its daily life and to its economic foundations. In addition, the







knowledge of how people lived in a region and time so significant for
human history is interesti ng in itself.
 The question is, of course, how far are the Cairo Geniza records apt
to provide us with an adequat e picture of the society that has left them
to us, and, secondly, how far is this particul ar society typical of life
around the Mediter ranean in this period in general.
 As may be concluded from the survey of the types of records pre-
served (given above, pp. 10-12), they do not illustrat e all sides of
 economic and social life with equal completeness. Thus we learn about
agricultu re and the technical aspects of arts and crafts far Jess than we
might wish, for the simple reason that the writers of these records had
little opportun ity to make mention of them. But the working people
 themselves are compara tively well represented and so are the more
general aspects of industry . Commerce and banking, naturall y, pro-
duced a huge amount of legal documents and business correspondence;
therefore, they are richly documented, and so, and for similar reasons,
is the life of the scholars and doctors. For special reasons explained on
 page 77, below, the upper class is reflected in letters for help addressed
to its members rather than in correspondence between them.
 As the Geniza was located in the same synagogue compound where
the courts held their sessions, we have abundan t material about them
and related matters. The Geniza records reveal also how the actions of
the government affected the life of the population and how the various
religious communities got along with each other. More than any other
topic, family life is illustrat ed by the Geniza, again, as in the case of
commerce and banking, and even more than there, because it is re-
flected in many types of legal documents as well as in letters. For the
things of daily life, such as food, clothing, houses; birth, upbringing,
illness, retireme nt, death and burial; social etiquette and customs, our
information is uneven, very rich in some respects and limited in others.
For people do not normally speak in their letters about things that
everyone knows. There is, however, one domain of daily ]ife for which
the Geniza provides many-si ded and detailed illustrati ons: travel and
seafaring. The reason for this is again self-evident: when people are
away from home, they write. Even if they are, like our men, experi-
enced travelers, who do not waste many words about their experiences,
still the very circumstances force them to tell us something about them.
Observations on people in foreign countries are scarce. Had the Geniza
been found in Spain, on the edge of the Islamic world, instead of
Egypt, its very center, the situation perhaps would have been different.
The tenth-ce ntury Spanish- Jewish traveler Ibrahim b. Ya'qiib is a case
in point. While visiting Rouen, he remarks that a certain fish in the
Seine river had the same taste and smell as a fish, called by him by
name, caught in the Nile. Thus, it stands to reason that he had traveled
to Egypt before visiting France and Central Europe. But no tale of his







 about :Muslim countries has been preserved. On the other hand, the
 cold, Christian north was a new experience for him. Therefore, his
 report on it is richer than anything found in the Geniza letters whose
 writers were confined to the Mediterranean.65
 The subject that interests us most, the mind of the Geniza people,
 the things they believed in and stood for, is not reflected in one
 particular type of document, but has to be abstracted from all the
 material in hand. Here, some sections of the literary fragments, which,
 as stated above, are at least twenty times as many as the documentary,
 will also have to be taken into account.
 The second question posed earlier, how far the society reflected in
 the Geniza papers may be regarded as representative of Mediterranean
 society in medieval times in general, is answered, partly implicitly, in
 chapter i and in Volume III, chapter x.







CHAPTER I


 The Mediterranean Scene
 During the Hig·h Middle Ages
(969-1250)



 1. HISTORICAL SURVEY
The Fatimid conquest of Egypt in July, 969, marks the beginning of
 the classical Geniza period. The eclipse of their successors, the
 Ayyubids, in 1250, roughly coincides with its end. 1
It was a time of profound and lasting changes on the Mediterranean
 scene. Naval superiority shifted from the Muslim south to the Chris-
 tian north. On the African coast, the center of gravity moved from
 Tunisia, which had been the nucleus of Fatimid power during the tenth
 century, eastward toward Egypt. Along the northern shore the trend
 was westward: Byzantium, in its role as the protagonist of Christen-
 dom, was replaced by the Italian republics, the Normans, and, later on,
 by the kingdoms of France and Spain.
During all this period, neither the Mediterranean as a whole nor
 either of its western or eastern basins was ever dominated exclusively
 by a single state. As a rule, governments enjoyed only comparatively
 short periods of strength or were altogether weak. With the exception
 of Venice, there was not one maritime power that lasted during all this
 time. It was a period of relatively free trade, of growing activities of
 exchange between the nations, and of the prominence of the mercantile
 middle class. In the eleventh and the major part of the twelfth centu-
 ries, a spirit of tolerance and liberalism prevailed, in particular in the
 Fatimid empire. The thirteenth century saw the victory of intolerance
 and fanaticism in the Muslim East, accompanied and furthered by the
 rule of alien soldier castes. At the same time, clerical influence and
 obscurantism became oppressive on the European shores of the Medi-
 terranean. Otherwise, however, the ways of East and West parted. The
 ancient unity of the Mediterranean world, which was characteristic of
 most of the period under discussion, definitely gave way to entirely







 new developments: a Europe, which was beginning to explore avenues
 never conceived before by the human spirit, and an East secluding and
 narrowing itself and making only limited use of its own spiritual
 heritage.
The Fatimid conquest of Egypt and the adjacent countries meant
 much for the history of the Mediterranean, and its significance is duly
 reflected in the Geniza records. A new dynasty, holding religious tenets
 different from those professed by the majority of Muslims, took posses-
 sion of the central provinces of the Arab world and controlled them for
 two centuries (969-1171). The Fatimid caliphs claimed to be descend-
 ants of the Prophet Muhammad (through his daughter Fatima) and
 were the exponents of the Isma'iliyya, an extremist sect, which as-
 cribed supernatural faculties to its religiopolitical leaders, an idea
 abhorred by other Muslims. This religious schism, tragic and ill-
 omened ~s it may have appeared to the contemporary Muslims, was of
 only transitory importance, as compared with the tremendous political,
 demographic, and economic changes, which accompanied or caused the
 Fatimid success.
In early Islam, as in Roman times, all North Africa was a colonial
 and provincial area. Egypt had to provide Syria, which was the seat of
 the caliphal government, as well as northern Arabia, which harbored
 the holy cities of Islam, with wheat and other victuals, just as it had
 done once for Rome, then the capital of the Mediterranean world.
 When the conquering Muslim Arabs pushed westward from Egypt
 through the whole of North Africa, they were hunting for slaves, gold,
 and other treasures. Those vast stretches of land were for them at the
 beginning nothing but a field for quick enrichment and ruthless exploi-
 tation. Then, as so often happens in history-North America is the
 most conspicuous example--those colonial areas prospered economi-
 cally and, in due course, acquired political strength. The once periph-
 eral territories became centers of power.
Muslim North Africa owed the ascendancy it achieved during the
 Fatimid period not only to its natural resources and certain favorable
 trends in world trade, discussed presently, but also to the influx of
 vigorous elements full of ambition, and sometimes also equipped with
 capital and technical know-how. All the various principalities that
 sprang up on the soil of Muslim North Africa down to this period,
 including the Fatimid, were founded and ruled by foreigners coming
 from the East: Arabs, Persians, and Turks. We read about the exploits
 of these adventurers in the accounts of the historians. The Geniza
 records teach us that the new bourgeiosie of the North African coun-
 tries, too, had its roots in the ancient centers of commerce and industry
 of Syria, Iraq, and Iran.2 This great population movement from East
 to West was in the main completed by the end of the tenth century, the
 time when the Geniza records begin to appear in larger numbers.3 Thus
 we notice in them the results rather than the course of this great







historical process. Our material consists in family names, the names of
grandparents or other ancestors, but sometimes also in direct references
to westward migration.
 The Fatimid conquest of Egypt was a movement in the opposite
direction. The country oi the Nile was conquered from the West, from
Tunisia, by an army consisting mostly of Berbers of the Ketama
people. From that time on, l{etamis were found all over Egypt, Pales-
tine, and Syria-as commanders, as insurgents, or as private citizens,
and in all these capacities they appear in the Geniza papers. 4 Our
sources by no means convey the impression that their presence deter-
mined the mold of Fatimid society. The Ketami conquest did not
convert the Fatimid empire into a Berber state. For the Berbers, like
another warlike people who became prominent in this period, the
Kurds, had 1ittle capacity or inclination for the formation of lasting
national states. In any event, the Fatimid caliphs soon counterbal-
anced the I{etamis by corps of Turkish mercenaries, Sudanese Negro
contingents, and Arab Bedouin levies, while for posts of confidence and
command they engaged persons from a great variety of races, including
Europeans (mostly former slaves of Slavic 5 provenance} and also
 availed themselves to a large extent of the services of local Christians
and Jews.
Somewhat more complicated is the question of how far the tenets
 and theology of the ruling sect were responsible for the character of the
new state. As noted earlier, the Fatimid period was one of relative
tolerance and liberalism, if compared with the preceding and, in partic-
 ular, the following periods. As the sect was organized as a secret
society, we know only the literature that was more or less destined for
 public consumption and we cannot be sure what the initiated admitted
to the innermost circle believed. The Geniza, naturally, cannot help us
 in this respect. The only express reference to the Isma'iliyya, found
 thus far, describes them as Jew-baiters, but in the document in ques-
 tion some local branch is ref erred to which might have represented an
 exception rather than the rule of conduct of that sect. 6 It is reasonable
to assume that the Fatimids and their Isma'ili followers did not create
 the comparatively liberal spirit of the period, but the fact that they
 represented only a small minority among the Muslim population of
 Egypt and Syria contributed to a trend of tolerance in their conduct of
 government and to a general leniency toward other minority groups.
Of greater import than the Ketami soldiers and the Isma'ili mission-
 aries were the changes in the trends of international trade and trade
 routes. During the tenth century Fatimid Tunisia and its dependencies
(Sicily and parts of Algeria and Libya} enjoyed an unprecedented
 efflorescence. They served as distributors of Indian and other Oriental
 products, as well as those of Egypt and Syria for the flourishing
 Muslim West and for economically ascending Christian Europe. It was
 this economic predominance that enabled Tunisia to conquer almost







the whole of North Africa to the Atlantic Ocean and, later on, even
Egypt with its adjacent countries.
 The eleventh century, however, witnessed a complete translocation
of the Mediterranean trade routes. The removal of the seat of the
Fatimid government from Tunisia to Egypt was in itself a vital
change. The army, the court, and the administration were the greatest
consumers and, naturally, contributed much to the shifting of the
center of trade from Qayrawan and al-Mahdiyya to Cairo and Alexan-
dria. Even more important, it seems, were the international develop-
ments. The merchant cities on the west coast of Italy, in particular
Genoa and Pisa, emerged as strong sea powers during this century,
with the corollary that the role of entrepot enjoyed by Tunisia slowly
slipped away from it. Europe traded directly with the Levant and also
obtained there the goods coming from India and the Far East. More-
over, ever larger ships were built toward the end of the century, which
were able to sail from Spain or France to Egypt or the Syro-
Palestinian coast without calling on an intermediate port.
 The economic eclipse of Tunisia was aggravated by political and
military disasters. In the forUes of the eleventh century, Tunisia
renounced its precarious allegiance to the Fatimids, bu~ had to pay a
terrible price for the break with its former overlords. First harassed by
Libyan pirates, who intercepted its trade with the East, it was laid
waste and its prosperity destroyed in the fifties, when a Fatimid vizier
unleashed against it the locust-like Bedouin hordes of the Hila.I and
Sulaym. Egypt took the place of Tunisia in the international trade,
and, as such, attracted the more enterprising elements from that coun-
try.
 Nothing is more impressive in the Geniza records of the period than
the spectacle of this migration of the Maghrebis, or Westerners, to
Egypt. [n the beginning, the merchants commute between the two
countries; then they take a house in Egypt, leaving their families back
in Tunisia; finally, they settle in the new country permanently. This
process becomes apparent early in the eleventh century, long before
Tunisia succumbed to the devastations of the Hila} and Sulaym. It is
most conspicuous during the second half of the century, but still in
operation around 1150, when new disasters, wrought by the hands of
the Normans, and later on by the Almohads, befell the unhappy
country. These disasters completed what the changes in the trends of
world trade had begun: the lively traffir between the mainland of
Europe and the Levant, which became even more accentuated in Cru-
saders' times, meant for Tunisia ( and later on also for Sicily) what the
discovery of the direct sea route to India did to Egypt four hundred
years later. 7
 The conquest of the central countries of the Arab world by the
Fatimids was an astounding feat. The fact that they were able to hold
them for two hundred years is almost a mystery. For with the excep-







tion of the first two caliphs ruling in Cairo, Mu'izz (d. 975) and 'Aziz
 (d. 996), they produced no ruler of distinction, and out of a total of
eleven rulers, three were adolescents and four mere children at the time
of their accession to the throne. As we have seen, their government was
alien, both religiously and racially. They ruled by playing one corps of
mercenaries against the other with the result that internecine wars
between the various factions were rampant. The history of the court
itself was marked by foul intrigues, cruel executions, and treacherous
assassinations. As from the second quarter of the eleventh century, the
chief ministers either followed each other with maddening rapidity or
usurped absolute rule for themselves. Despite all this, Egypt was a rich
and flourishing country, the most prosperous among the kingdoms of
Islam. As such it is described by contemporary travelers, whose
impressions are confirmed, or at least not contradicted, by the Geniza
records. How was this marvel of a prosperous society living under an
unsatisfactory system of government achieved?
 The Fatimid miracle (which is by no means unique in history) is to
be largely explained by two circumstances: the comparatively little
interference by the governments in the trade of their subjects-a fact
a1so manifested in the reasonable customs tariffs-and the generally
favorable situation created by the growing needs of an economically
rising Europe, with Egypt and Syria serving as distribution centers and
largely also as suppliers. In fairness to the Fatimids one has to add
that their elaborate system of administration, which was organized
with almost scientific precision, also contributed much to their success.
To be sure, Egypt was already the classical country of bureaucratic
rule even in Pharaonic, Hellenistic, and Roman times, and much of the
old order was carried over into the Islamic period. Still, it was the two
first Fatimid caliphs of Egypt who laid the foundations of a new order
that persisted despite the checkered fate and the frequent breakdown
of the central government.
 In this task, Mu'izz and 'Aziz were assisted by a great vizier, Ya'qiib
 (Jacob) Ibn Killis, who must, indeed, be regarded as the creator of the
internal administration of the new empire. As his career is typical of
the period, a few words are said here about him. He was a Jew from
Iraq, who, like many other Easterners of the tenth century, moved
westward. first to Ramie in Palestine, where he became a representa-
tive of the merchants, a position, as we shall see, comparable to that of
the consuls in the Italian rolonies in the Levant. He soon moved on to
Egypt, where he attracted the attention of the ruler of that country by
his honesty, astuteness, and efficiency. "Were he a Muslim, he would
have been the right man for vizier," that ruler is reputed to have said
of him. Ibn Killis understood and removed his congenital disability by
embracing Islam, but had to leave the country soon in order to escape a
plot against him by the vizier in office. He proceeded still further to the
West, to Tunisia, where he was introduced to Mu'izz by some Jews of







 the caliph's entourage. His description of Egypt's weakness holstered
 Mu'izz in his determination to attack that country. The financial chaos
 following the conquest required bold measures and Ibn Killis, en-
 trusted, together with another man, with the reorganization of taxes
 and finances, carried through a remarkable monetary reform. Mu'izz
 died soon afterward, and when Ibn Killis showed sound judgment in
 foreign affairs as well, he was appointed vizier, the first to hold such an
 office in Fatimid Egypt. He kept the post for thirteen years until his
 death in 991.'
Thus we have in Ibn Killis an example of western Asian talent
 promoting the rise of Muslim North Africa; of a member of the
 merchants' class organizing an empire; and also a representative of the
 liberal spirit of the Fatimid period. For, unlike renegades in less
 tolerant times, Ibn Killis made copious use of the talents of his former
 coreligionists, as well as of Christians, in the administration of the
 provinces, and this policy was continued by his Christian successor,
 who appointed a Jew as his deputy in Syria. It must be remarked that
 the caliph had to cede to popular pressure and finally removed both the
 Christian vizier and his Jewish deputy. We find, however, professing
 Christians and Jews in the highest positions in the Fa.timid administra-
 tion later on also.
An auxiliary element in Fa.timid success was their highly developed
 and efficient propaganda. The sect that served them resembled in some
 respects a well-organized modern political party. The present-day
 Arabic term for propagandist is indeed the ancient Isma'ili word for
 missionary. The Fatimids had at their disposal a ramified organization
 reaching far beyond the frontiers of their own state. They knew how
 to make friends and how to influence public opinion. For example,
 al-I;lakim (996-1021), the interesting psychopathic caliph, who ordered
 the destruction of churches and synagogues and the forceful conversion
 or expulsion of Christians and Jews, is described, shortly before this
 event, in a poetical Hebrew "scroll" as a messianic prince of justice and
 peace, and similar praise is found in a Christian writer. 9 The viceroy
 al-Malik al-Afq.al (1095-1121), the first Fa.timid commander to en-
 counter the Crusaders, was certainly a capable man. Still, the overen-
 thusiastic praise extended to him even by foreigners passing through
 Egypt seems to echo skillful propaganda, as when a French Jew (a
 certain Benveniste from Narbonne) places him in Paradise together
 with the pious kings from the house of David, or when a Maghrebi
 pilgrim writes of him, that no king had ever spread justice in the world
 as he had done.10
The most effective reason for the long rule of the Fatimids, it seems,
 was the general state of the Mediterranean region during the period
 under discussion: there was no other power strong enough to dislodge
 them. This does not mean that peace prevailed along the borders of the
 Fatimid empire. On the contrary; war was waged almost without







interruption, especially in Palestine and Syria, which never enjoyed
even short respites during this whole period. For the first hundred
yearsi the Fatimids tried in vain to pacify and dominate this region
and to hold it against petty local rulers, recalcitrant cities, belligerent
sects, and rapacious Bedouin chieftains, the latter, as always in turbu-
lent times, being the most terrible scourge for the sedentary population.
 Then, in the third quarter of the eleventh century, a new element
appeared on the scene: the Seljuk Turks. The central Asian Turks had
been a dominating factor in the history of the Arabic-speaking coun-
tries since the ninth century. Many of the best Fatimid generals had
been Turks. All these, however, had been individuals, mostly imported
as slaves and often retaining this status legally, even after having been
appointed to responsible posts of command. The novelty of the Seljuk
invasion was that a whole Turkish people was now on the move to
conquer most of western Asia on its own. In 1055 Baghdad was taken,
and when Syria and Palestine were attacked by them, there was no
Fatimid army available to defend these countries, for, as usual, order
had to be restored in faction-torn Egypt itself. In 1071, Jerusalem was
conquered by the Seljuks, and five years later Damascus (which had
withstood previous assaults)-never to be regained by the Fatimids.
 Considering the fate of Syria and Palestine during the century pre-
 ceding the Crusades, we are able to appreciate that the local population
 viewed the newcomers from Europe in a way very much different from
what we would anticipate. Having been accustomed to incessant war-
 fare and tribulations by ever new invaders, the man in the street was
unable to recognize the particular character of the Crusaders' move-
ment.11 He was not to be blamed for this, for the most competent Muslim
ruler of that time, the .aforementioned al-Malik al-Afq.al, made the
 same mistake. He welcomed the Crusaders as his natural allies against
 the Seljuks and hurried to lay siege on Jerusalem at the time when the
 "Franks" (as the Crusaders were called in the East) consolidated their
 position in northern Syria. He conquered the city in September, 1098,
 but failed to provide it with an adequate garrison so that it fell an easy
 prey to the Crusaders in July, 1099. The Fatimid governor was given
 safe conduct with his whole entourage (including the Jews who were in
 government service), but the Crusaders followed up their victory with
 an attack on the main Fatimid army, which was ignominiously routed.
 A quarter of a century of war with changing fortunes ensued. By 1124,
 the whole of the Syro-Palestinian coast, with the sole exception of
 Ascalon in southern Palestine, was in the hands of the Crusaders.
 Finally, in 1153, at a time when the Fatimid court was disgraced by a
 series of incredible atrocities, even this last stronghold fell to the
 Franks, and the way was open for them to take the offensive against
 Egypt itself.
 Meanwhile, however, a new power had emerged in western Asia. The
 Seljuk empire had disintegrated shortly before the arrival of the Cru-







 saders-this event indeed made their victory possible. Out of the
 debris, some new kingdoms arose, one of which was to play a major
 role in Mediterranean history: that of Nur al-Din Zengi, the grandson
 of a Turkish mamluk (slave-soldier) and originally lord of Aleppo and
 Mosul. By taking Damascus in April, 1154, he obtained control of all
 Syria (with the exception of the Crusaders' states). Nur al-Din was
 the first representative of a new type of ruler of Turkish descent who
 made a great impact on the history of the Middle East. He was a
 fearless soldier and great commander and a staunch supporter of
 Muslim orthodoxy and learning. He hated the infidels, but made a
 serious effort to conduct his government in justice. "If his own son and
 a Jew would appear before him, and his son was wrong, he would not
 hesitate to decide in favor of the Jew."
The conquest of Ascalon by the Crusaders in I 153, and the annexa-
 tion of Damascus by Nur al-Din in 1154, were almost simultaneous.
 Since the Fatimid government was entirely disabled because of inter-
 nal strife, only those two powers-remained on the southeastern shore of
 the Mediterranean. Soon the race for Egypt began between the two.
 For whoever would succeed in taking it, would be able to overcome the
 other with the help of its great resources. A confusing series of entan-
 gled political maneuvers and military clashes ensued. In general, the
 Fatimid counselors were inclined to prefer the Franks, in the correct
 assumption that these would be content with some kind of suzerainty,
 while Nur al-Din's Turks would try to abolish the Fatimid caliphate
 altogether and occupy the country for themselves. The Franks commit-
 ted unpardonable blunders and atrocities, however, the worst of which
 was the unprovoked ghastly massacre of the inhabitants of Bilbays, a
 town near Cairo, on November 3, 1168. The scales turned in favor of
 Nur al-Din, who again had sent an army to Egypt, after two previous
 trials had failed. A member of this expedition was the famous Saladin,
 who soon was to become the leading personality in the eastern Medi-
 terranean for most of the remaining part of the twelfth century.
As sometimes happens in the life of a genius, a series of favorable
 co!ncidences gave Saladin opportunity to rise to power. His uncle, the
 commander of Nur al-Din's expeditionary force, was appointed vizier
 of the Fatimid state, but passed away shortly after his appointment,
 leaving his nephew to take his place. When Saladin dared to depose the
 weak and sick Fatimid caliph, the latter died before even becoming
 aware of his deposition, which spared Saladin the invidious task of
 doing away with hlm. Finally, and most important of all: Nur al-Din,
 Saladin's overlord, who was rightly suspicious of his successful general,
 was also gathered in to his forefathers at the right moment, and
 ~aladin was able to seize his kingdom. With Egypt, Syria, and north-
 ern Mesopotamia in his hands, he turned against the Crusaders and,
 after some vicissitudes of fortune, dealt them a crushing defeat. Jeru-







salem was recovered on October 2, 1187, and, with the exception of
Tyre, the entire Syro-Palestinian coast was seized as well.
 It is characteristic for the situation in the Mediterranean at that
time, or perhaps for the significance of naval power in general, that the
possession of one single fortified seaport enabled the Christians to re-
sume the Crusades and to become again a power to be reckoned with in
the Levant. Under Saladin himself, there was a marked decline of
Muslim seapower. He had started out by making extensive use of
naval operations, both in the Red Sea and, in particular, in the Medi-
terranean. As late as 1180, he had been able to force King Baldwin of
Jerusalem to make peace by harassing the Syro-Palestinian coast with
bis Egyptian navy. But in 1191, after the bitter experience of the Third
Crusade, he found himself forced to order the destruction of Ascalon,
the flourishing seaport of southern Palestine, because he saw no other
way of protecting this vital point from attack by European fleets.
 Under his successors, Egypt itself was invaded from the sea. When,
in 1219, Damietta, the great seaport at the mouth of the eastern branch
of the Nile was about to fall, the Muslims offered to surrender the
kingdom of Jerusalem if the Crusaders were prepared to leave the
Egyptian coast. The fact that this ostensibly attractive offer was
turned down, is taken by some scholars as an indication that a new
period of history had begun, when the lust for colonial expansion
replaced the zeal for the Holy War. This view can hardly be main-
tained. The papal legate, who was the official commander of the expedi-
tion, was the most adamant among those refusing the Muslim offer,
and thirty years later, Louis IX of France, the most Christian of all
Christian kings, also directed his Crusade against the Egyptian coast.
Rather it seems that, while religious and worldly motifs were intermin-
gled from the very beginning of the Crusaders' movement, in the course
of time, the leaders from western Europe had become more familiar
with the strategy of warfare in the eastern Mediterranean and tried to
create a broader base from which to protect the kingdom of Jerusalem.
 Both in 1219 and in 1249, Damietta was taken. But both conquests
were vitiated by fantastic errors and subsequent military disasters.
Crusader wars were fought on a smaller scale for about another half a
century. But not until Napoleon set sail for Egypt in May, 1798, was a
conquering army led again from the lands of the Franks to the shores
of the Levant.
 Saladin, the champion of Islam, was a ruler of a type similar to that
of his former overlord Nur al-Din, but he was a greater man and was
recognized as such by eastern and western contemporaries. The fact
that he was a Kurd had considerable influence on the composition of
his armies and in particular of his officers' corps; otherwise, it had even
less significance for the character of his kingdom than the presence of
Berbers in Fatimid Egypt.







The dynasty founded by him, the Ayyubids (1171-1250)-so called
 after Ayyiib (the Arabic form of the biblical name Job), Saladin's
 father-represents a period of transition. The system of slave soldiers,
 although an ancient Islamic, and indeed, pre-Islamic institution, be-
 came even more developed under them, and Saladin himself was called
a mam1uk by his Muslim adversaries. The final eclipse of Egyptian
seapower under Saladin has already been mentioned. Even more signif-
icant was the general character of the Ayyubid period. On the one
hand, we encounter a spirit of mounting religious strictness, if not
intolerance, but, on the other hand, much of the mundane and liberal
attitude of the two preceding centuries still prevailed. Both these
aspects are discernible in the Geniza papers. The ancient discrimina-
tory laws were renewed or their renewal was attempted, while the
Sultans and their entourage were still in close contact with people of
other creeds, and amiable, and sometimes even cordial relations existed
between both sides.12
 With the advent, in 1250, of the Mamluks as rulers of Egypt and
Syria, bigotry and fanaticism became paramount. The organization of
that great state of slave soldiers, which maintained itself by continuous
import of vigorous men from distant countries, was in many respects
very remarkable. But their government was perforce artificial and
oppressive and, like other artificial and oppressive governments, it
tried to satisfy its subjects by yielding to their lowest instincts. The
Geniza reflects the unsatisfactory situation by a number of examples
and perhaps even more by its overall silence.
 The Mamluks turned their backs to the Mediterranean. Following
Saladin's example they dismantled, and in many cases destroyed, the
seaports and laid waste much of the coastal region in order to discour-
age attacks by European navies. This turning away from the Mediter-
ranean scene by a soldiers' caste, which had its roots in central Asia, in
the Russian steppes and the Caucasus, was of more than military
significance.13
 Another great seapower of the eastern Mediterranean which declined
quickly during this period was Byzantium. The second part of the
tenth century, which saw the conquests of the Fatimids, was also the
heyday of Byzantine ascendancy. The island of Crete was taken in
961, Cyprus in 965, and Antioch with its seaport Suwaydiyya in 969,
the same year in which the Fatimids conquered Egypt. Thus, the
maritime bastions dominating the eastern Mediterranean, as well as
the borderlands between Asia Minor and Syria, were again in the
hands of the Rum, the "Romans," as the Byzantines designated them-
selves and were called by the Muslims, although their language was
Greek, and as Greeks they appeared to the Christians of western
Europe. It was inevitable that the two great eastern powers, Byzan-
tium and the Fatimids, should clash. But these clashes never developed
into major wars of long duration. This owed partly to the fact that

 smaller principalities soon acted as buffer states between the two.
 There also seems to have been, at least on the Fatirnid side, an element
 of deliberate policy. When the wise vizier Ibn Killis lay on his death-
 bed, he was asked by his caliph for political advice. He counseled to
 exterminate the unruly Bedouin chiefs, but to keep peace with the
 Romans, as long as they consented to so do. In general, the Fatimids
 followed this advice, and ten-year armistice treaties-a longer commit-
 ment is not allowed according to Muslim law-were concluded and
 renewed. Clearly, the two rich empires were the elements of stability in
 the area.
There were also other circumstances that prevented Byzantium and
 the Fatimids from fighting each other with an all-out effort. During
 most of the eleventh century neither had competent rulers strong
 enough to organize far-flung military operations, and, in the second
 part of the century, both were menaced by a common foe, the Seljuk
 Turks. In the same year, 1071, when one branch of that warlike people
 snatched Jerusalem away from the Fatimids, its main army van-
 quished and captured the Byzantine emperor. Asia Minor, the heart-
 land of Byzantium, lay open to Turkish invasion.
Here, however, we must be careful not to view this crucial period too
 much in the light of later developments. We now know that the year
 1071 was the beginning of the end, that it inaugurated that long
 process of the penetration of Asia Minor by peoples of Turkish race,
 which ended, in the twenties of our own century, with the total disap-
 pearance from there of anything Greek. But what proved in the long
 run to be a radical change, naturally appeared to the contemporaries as
 only one of many setbacks that were inevitable for an empire that was
 open on all sides to the attacks of barbarian peoples. Shortly after the
 defeat of 1071, Byzantium recovered and gained strength, being ruled
 successively by three astute and strong emperors, father, son and
 grandson, Alexius, John, and Manuel Comnenus (1081-1180), all three
 familiar to the students of western European history because of their
 close connection with the Crusaders and the Latin states established by
 the latter. It is indicative of the prosperity and the prestige enjoyed by
 the Byzantine Empire during the first half of the twelfth century that
 Jews emigrated there in considerable numbers from the Fatimid coun-
 tries, as we learn from the letter of an Egyptian physician who settled
 in Asia Minor and from other Geniza sources. 14
Manuel, the last of the three great Comneni, perhaps erred in at-
 tempting to restore Byzantine suzerainty in the seas and countries west
 of Greece. In any case, it was as the result of an attack from the West,
 and not the East, that Constantinople succumbed in 1204 and that
 Byzantium lost its position as a Mediterranean power altogether.
In the West, the dominating feature was the rise of the Italian
 maritime cities on the one hand, and the foundation and development
 of the Norman kingdom of the "two Sicilies" (Sicily and southern







 Italy) on the other. The rule over this kingdom by the German em-
 peror Frederic II, who was himself a native of southern Italy
 (1194-1250) marked in many respects the end of the High Middle
 Ages. Even the syncretistic character of the civilization of Frederic's
 Sicilian kingdom, where Byzantine, western European, and Muslim
 Arabic elements mingled freely, is characteristic of the preceding
 rather than of the following period. Conversely, the reign of Louis IX
 of France (1226-1270), Frederic's younger contemporary, although
 himself an embodiment of all medieval ideals-we have already seen
 him on his crusade to Egypt; he died on another crusade to
 Tunisia-ushers in a new epoch, that of national states, which formed
 the frames for the development of national cultures.
During most of the eleventh century, the Italian city-states, with the
 exception of Venice, Lucca, Salerno, and Amalfi, were still outside the
 horizon of the Geniza papers. All seafaring was done on ships whose
 proprietors, whether Muslims, Christians, or Jews, bear Arabic or
 Arabicized names. In the twelfth century, however, it was common for
 the people represented in the Geniza records to travel on Genoese,
 Pisan, Gaetan, and other Riim ships, wLile Venetian ships are also
 mentioned, although not as used by Jews. 15 The struggle for Sicily and
 southern Italy, in which Byzantines, Muslims, local Italians, and Nor-
 mans took part, as we11 as the successful attacks of the two latter on
 various points of the North African coast, is copiously reflected in the
 Geniza.
Despite the close connections between the Jews of southern France
 (Narbonne, Lunel, Montpe1lier, Aries, Marseilles) and those of the
 Muslim East, no references to political or other events in that area
 have been found in the Geniza, if we disregard accounts about hard-
 ships endured by Jewish individuals or communities. Only Marseilles is
 mentioned as a port from which one sailed directly to Egypt.
Of all the countries of the Mediterranean, Spain witnessed the most
 drastic changes during this period. Near the end of the tenth century
 the situation around the Mediterranean appeared to be one of great
 stability: a st,rong Byzantium dominating the northeast, a Fa timid
 empire stretching from Syria to the borders of Morocco, and Umayyad
 Spain being ruled by the powerful viceroy al-Man~iir ("The Victori-
 ous"), who, in fifty military expeditions, assured an almost unchal-
 lenged ascendancy over the Christian principalities of northern Spain
 and over the towns and tribes of most of Morocco. We have alreadv
 seen how fast both Byzantine and Fatimid power declined. Th,e
 Umayyad caliphate disappeared altogethe:.- within one generation after
 the death of al-Man~iir, which occurred in August, 1002. The great
 Christian reconquest of Spain began to assume unprecedented dimen-
 sions. It was checked twice by mighty Berber kingdoms, which suc-
 cessively occupied and protected Muslim Spain, the Almoravids and
 the Almohads. In both cases, however, the Berbers lost their vigor after







 comparatively short periods of glorious achievements. With the fall of
 Seville, then the capital of Muslim Spain, in November, 1248, the whole
 Iberian Peninsula again became a Christian domain; even the small
 Muslim kingdom of Granada in the southeastern corner of the country,
 which miraculously survived for another two and a half centuries, was
 under the suzerainty of the Christian kings of Castilia, while all the
 attempts of the sultans of Morocco to renew the attack on Spain re-
 mained abortive. The Straits of Gibraltar, which had formed a most
 frequented bridge between Africa and Europe for six hundred years,
 became a barrier between the two continents by the end of the thirteenth
 century.
The history of North Africa itself was characterized during this
 period by great population movements: first, the invasion of the Arab
 tribes of the Hilal and Sulaym, already described as a fatal blow to
 Tunisia's prosperity. The invaders finally penetrated into most parts
 of North Africa and contributed much to its general decline, but also
 to its progressive Arabization. Almost coinciding with this movement
 was another, coming from the opposite direction, originating deep in the
 southwestern Sahara in a subsection of the Berber people of the $anhaja
(from which modern "Senegal" is derived}. Basically a Muslim reli-
 gious movement, spawned by missionary border warfare, the Al-
 moravids (Arabic al-Mura.bit, "border warfarer"), soon flooded the
 whole of Morocco and western Algeria and conquered even Muslim
 Spain, fighting Christians and Muslims alike (1061-1147). They were
 superseded by another, even more powerful Berber kingdom, the Al-
 mohads (Arabic al-Muwal)l)id, "a true believer in one God") (1130-
 1269; ousted from Spain around 1229}. Their nucleus was a religious
 sect of extreme puritanic and traditionalistic tendencies, which regarded
 all Muslims who did not adhere to their dispensation, including the
 caliphs of Baghdad, as unbelievers and left to Christians and Jews the
 choice only between Islam or the sword. When we find, in a country
 that had produced St. Augustine, that no local Christians were left, the
 Almohad persecution is largely to blame, whereas the Jews of North
 Africa were too numerous to be totally submerged. This religious move-
 ment started within a Berber people, too, and led to great population
 shifts. The Almohads conquered Morocco, Algeria, and Muslim Spain,
 and also Tunisia and Tripoli (Libya), from which the Normans were
 finally driven out. At the beginning, the mowment had a distinct na-
 tional tenor, using the Berber language even for the literary expression
 of religious ideas. But the crude Berber dialect was not in a position to
 compete with the accomplished diction and terminology of classical
 Arabic. Consequently, even this greatest of all Berber kingdoms did not
 succeed in making, or keeping, North Africa a Berber entity.
The terrible sufferings endured by the civil population in the wake of
 the three cataclysms described have left their mark in the Geniza.
 These upheavals encouraged and brought to a climax the migration of







 middle-class people from the Muslim West to the East, which was
 characteristic of the eleventh and the twelfth in contrast to the preced-
 ing centuries. How the civil population fared during such turbulent
 times is the subject of this book.


 2. INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS
 Seeing that so many different states, racee, and religious dispensa-
tions existed side by side or succeeded each other in the area and period
under discussion, one wonders whether the term Mediterranean scene
should be applied to them at all. We might ask: Did the peoples of the
various countries have incentives and opportunities to meet and mix
with each other, or did the many boundaries and enmities strangle their
mobility and free movement? Were there any bonds of unity which en-
compassed the whole or the greater part of the Mediterranean area, or
was each country and religious persuasion confined to its own parochial
existence? I try to answer these questions, insofar as the Geniza
records contribute to their elucidation.
 There is no specific word for "Mediterranean" in the Geniza records.
The ancient Arab term "The Sea of the Romans'' (as opposed to "The
Sea of the Indians," the Indian Ocean) never occurs in them, and one
has the impression that in the writings of the Muslim geographers of
this period it appears as a traditional scientific term rather than a
name in living use. 1 The Mediterranean was "The Sea" par excellence,
and as such, of course, it is mentioned in our records countless times.
 As long as one traveled on the Mediterranean, one was, so to speak,
within one's own precincts and never beyond reach. A merchant from
Biina (Bone in Algeria), who wanted to collect debts in Old Cairo a
few days prior to the date they fell due, pretended that he was
traveling to Yemen in South Arabia. As soon as it became apparent
that he had departed for Algeria, the debtor was furious: "Had I
known that he was going only to the West, I would not have paid him a
thing." 2 Conversely, a debtor in Old Cairo who was unable to meet his
commitments would flee to 'Aydhiib, the great port on the coast of the
Red Sea: the Mediterranean was much too frequented to provide a
refuge.3 A journey from Spain to Egypt or from Marseilles to the
Levant was a humdrum experience, about which a seasoned traveler
would not waste a word. 4 Commuting regularly between Tunisia or
Sicily or even Spain and the eastern shores of the Mediterranean was
nothing exceptional: "I am astonished that he has not come around
Passover [Easter], as he is accustomed to do," says a letter from
Alexandria with regard to a merchant from Tunisia,5 and there are
numerous cases of persons from Qayrawan or Palermo or Seville of
whom we read that they made similar journeys repeatedly. 8 A mer-
chant suffering from a chronic disease would not think a trip from







 Egypt to Constantinople too trying {he was, however, kept there by his
 illness for two and a half years) .7 In short, the Mediterranean was a
 pontos euxeinos, a friendly I inviting sea-a fact, to be sure, stated by
 the Geniza letter writers only when they had the opportunity to see
 another sea, the frightening Indian Ocean.8
The Mediterranean area was divided into three great regions:
1. "The East," namely Egypt and the Muslim countries of south-
 western Asia. This term was not very much used. Normally, the
 country or locality intended was specified, even in letters written by
 western people. 9
2. "The Muslim West," al-Maghreb, comprising all North Africa
 west of Egypt, including Muslim Sicily, with Andalus, or Spain, form-
 ing a subsection. This term is annoyingly common, so that often we do
 not know whether the person or merchandise referred to came from
 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sicily, or Spain.
3. "The Land of the 'Romans,' " al-Riim, originally designating
 Byzantium, but used vaguely for Christian Europe and its peoples in
 general well into the twelfth century.
The term Ifranj, "the Franks" for western Europe, already appears
 in the oldest Geniza papers, where, for example, the Italian town of
 Lucca is described in a Hebrew letter as being in the land of Firanga,
 which originally means the Frankish empire of Charlemagne.10 But
 even in the eleventh century the term is still used very sparingly, for
 example, with regard to a traveler coming from France,11 or when an
 eminent French Jewish scholar was called Isaac the Frank because he
 happened to bear the same first name as some distinguished contempo-
 raries in Muslim countries. 12 When the Crusaders made their appear-
 ance, the term was applied to them, but only from the second part of
 the twelfth century were Rum, Byzantium, and Ifranj, western Europe,
 distinguished clearly and regularly. From the beginning of the thir-
 teenth century, France proper was designated as Ifransa, as opposed,
 for example, to then Christian Sicily,13 while Ifranj retained its general
 meaning of western European. Thus, in a fifteenth-century Geniza
 paper, we find the expression: al-Ifranji al-Janawi, "the Frank, the
 Genoese," and this with regard to an ambassador.u As is well known,
~his designation remained in popular use in the Levant up to the
 threshold of our own times.
Occasionally, especial!y in reports of the arrival of ships, the Muslim
 West and the European West were lumped tQgether1 as in the following
 passage of a letter from Alexandria, Egypt: "No one has arrived from
 the West: neither from Tripoli, nor from Sicily, nor from the land of
 the Rum." 15
The terminology betrays the existence of a deep barrier between the
 Muslim East and the Muslim West and between both and Europe
(including Byzantine Asia Minor). When a person describes another as
 a Rumi or a Maghrebi, without specifying his city or country, he shows







 lack of familiarity with, or interest in, the latter's permanent or
 original domicile. Besides its geographical remoteness-the desert be-
 gins immediately west of Alexandria-the Muslim West differed from
 the East by being at that time predominantly Berber, as well as by its
 religious idiosyncrasies, described earlier. As regards the relations with
 the Rum, the contrasts of religion and race were, of course, even
 stronger and they were accentuated by the difference of the languages
 and scripts in vogue on the northern and the southern shores of the
 Mediterranean .
 .Yet Europeans are present everywhere in the Geniza records and in
 the most variegated capacities. In the first place, naturally, as traders.
 As such they are found with equal frequency in the Muslim East and
 the Muslim West, and in the eleventh century not less than in the
 twelfth. Nor were they confined to the coastal towns. Thus we read in a
 letter sent from Alexandria to Old Cairo in the latter years of the
 eleventh century: "Please take notice that no pepper, cinnamon or
 ginger are available in Alexandria. If you have any of these commodi-
 ties, keep them, for the Rum [here: Byzantines} are keen solely on
 them. AJl the Rum are about to leave for Old Cairo. They are only
 waiting for the arrival of two additional ships from Constantinople. 1118
 In another letter from the same town, written a little earlier, the writer
 asks his business correspondent in Old Cairo to hold his date palm fiber
 until the Rum arrived there from Damietta, as they were expected to
 do according to information given to him.17 Still earlier, around 1035,
 we hear of an unprecedented boom in odoriferous woods in Old Cairo
 because of the Rum: "They did not leave a single piece of it when they
 departed for their country." 18 A "Market of the Greeks," situated in
 the "Castle of Edom," the ancient Roman fortress that formed the
 nucleus of the town of Old Cairo, is mentioned in a document from the
 year 959, a detail seemingly not noted by the Muslim geographers.19 In
 Tunisia, too, business was done with the Eu:ropean merchants not only
 in al-Mahdiyya and other seaports, but in inland Qayrawan as well.20
The impact of the European trade on the local market was over-
 whelming. In Tunisia, as one ancient letter alludes, everything de-
 pended on the Riim and on the Andalusians. 21 About the former, a price
 list from Tunisia states: "Pepper (a hundred pounds)-33 dinars,
 because of the demand for it by the Rum." "The price of pepper,"
 writes a man from al-Mahdiyya, "used to be 36, but is today 38; at
 least, this is how the Rum buy it." "If the Europeans will be eager to
 purchase pepper, its price will be higher." "The Riim bought the pepper
 because the ships [bringing the Andalusian merchants] were late. 11 In
 another letter from the same town, the writer complains about the
 catastrophic price of the pepper (25 dinars) and adds that payment
 was made for it half in Sicilian and half in Pisan currencies, so that, in
 addition, an agio was required for converting the proceeds into local
 money. The five letters quoted are all from Tunisia, from the second







 third of the eleventh century. Thus we see that the influence of the
 Europeans was substantial in fixing the market price and that they
 were sometimes able to impose payment in their own currencies. 22
In Old Cairo, a similar situation prevailed. A letter containing price
 Ests and other valuable economic data sent from Old Cairo to Aden on
 January 9, 1133, has the following to report: "This year, business is at
 a standstill, for no one has come from the West, and only a few Rum
[here: Byzantines] have arrived." 23 About thirty years earlier, another
 letter dispatched from O1d Cairo to Aden strikes a similar note: "The
 Sultan [al-Malik al-Afqal] imprisoned the Genoesc, which caused great
 consternation among the Rum [here: Europeans in general] and no
 goods can be sold because of this. It looks as if this recession will last
 long, so that everyone's business has come to a halt." 24 The imprison-
 ment of the Genoese most probably was connected with the great
 Genoese exploits during the Crusaders' conquest of the Syro-Palestinian
 coastal cities (Caesarea, 1101; Acre, 1104; Tripoli, 1109; Beirut, 1110).
 That Genoese merchants should have frequented the marts of Old Cairo
 at a time when their fellow citizens attacked vital ports of the Fatimid
 empire, seems strange to us today, but was perhaps looked upon differ-
 ently in the early years of the twelfth century.
To sell to Europeans was the dream of the local merchants. In a
 letter written in 1085, a Tunisian was reported to have made an
 excellent sale when he sold his brazilwood to Rum in a Palestinian
 seaport at a profit of 150 percent. Brazilwood, just in passing, was one
 of the most common commodities traded at that time. The word, of
 rourse, has nothing to do with the country of Brazil, but is connected
 with the word brazier and means literally wood of flaming color. It is a
 wood grown in the East Indies, from which a valuable red dye was
 made. 25 Another much sought after article used in the dyeing industry,
 as well as in medicine, was potash alum. Approximately at the time of
 the letter just referred to, a merchant from Alexandria writes to his
 correspondent in Old Cairo: "The alum has not yet arrived fit came
 from Upper Egypt or from Yemen J. Here are Rum; we shall offer it to
 them and we hope they will buy it." Alum is sold to the Rum also in
 another contemporary letter. 26 When Egyptian flax, owing to the inse-
 curity of the inland routes, did not find buyers in the southern Palestin-
 ian port of Ascalon, it was the customers from Europe who saved the
 day by demanding it eagerly. 27 In 1064, a letter from Sicily explains
 that "even" the Rum present in Palermo were not prepared to buy the
 inferior black ginger offered to them. Thus it had to be sent on to
 another European country, where it was sold-not without loss. 28
The 1064 incident shows that the Europeans were expected to be
 satisfied with second-rate merchandise. An even more telling example
 of the Rum's strange ways in business is to be found in the following
 quotation from a letter from Alexandria (around 1060): "Of late, Rum
 ships have arrived. Immediately after their arrival, their merchants







 were very active. Then they kept back and did not show much eager-
 ness. They bought indigo at the auction [literally: in the circle] for
 excessive prices and some brazilwood for 120 [ dinars per camel load,
 also an exorbitant price J. Then they stopped. They do not distinguish
 between first-class and inferior goods; for every quality they pay the
 same price. Likewise, the flax-they buy the poor quality for the same
 price as the excellent and are not prepared to pay more for the latter.
 They are greatly interested [in flax, it seems) and say that other Rum
 will soon arrive." 29
In all the cases quoted, we find the Europeans as buyers, and it is
 noteworthy that the products sought by them were identical with those
 that also ranked foremost in the trade between the Muslim countries of
 the Mediterranean. But there was also a very lively export of Byzan-
 tine and western European goods to the Muslim area. This export,
 however, with few exceptions, such as cheese, was not handled by Jews.
 Therefore, we find records of it mostly in Geniza documents other than
 business letters, for example, in marriage settlements, which register
 the clothing, bedding, and furniture brought in by the bride as part of
 her marriage portion. Thus a Jewish bride in the Muslim East could
 not do without a Riim kerchief (mandil, or mindil, derived from the
 same Latin root as Spanish mantilla or English mantle), whether this
 was in Damascus, 956, or in Old Cairo in the years 1040, 1050, 1067,
 1115, and later. 30 Richer brides would have a Riim brocade bedcover,
 worth, on the average, IO dinars '(a sum large enough to sustain a
 middle-sized family for five months), or even a Riim brocade couch.
 Reference to these cherished items is found, for example, in documents
 dated 1031, 1034, 1050, 1064, as well as about a hundred years later in
 1155, all from Old Cairo. 31
As wood was scarce in the Middle East, we are not astonished to find
 Rum chests, cupboards, and bedsteads among the furniture mentioned
 in the Geniza, although their transport by sea must have been precari-
 ous in those times. Timber, of course, was a main export from Europe
 to the Muslim side of the Mediterranean. At the beginning of the
 twelfth century we find merchants from Amalfi and Genoa engaged. in
 this trade, while at its end we hear of two Venetian ships carrying to
 Alexandria this material which was so indispensable in peace and in
 war. 82
Cheese was the staple protein food for the poorer sections of the
 population in Egypt. To a large extent this also was imported from
 Christian Europe. We have dated references for the import of cheese
 from Sicily (Syracuse, 1241 and Messina, 1263), and information of
 many undated shipments from earlier centuries. Crete was also an
 exporter of cheese, and so was Rum in general. A ship from Amalfi in
 southern Italy brought, besides silk, honey to Alexandria, and the
 European winesellers, so prominent in that Egyptian port, certainly
 carried the products of their native countries.33







 From Roman times to our own, corals have been an article of export,
from the Mediterranean area to the countries of the Indian Ocean.
This trade was particularly brisk during the period covered by the
Geniza papers. The corals were co11ected partly from the Tunisian and
partly from the European shores of the Mediterranean, whence they
were sent to Egypt for reexportation. "No corals have arrived, so for,
either from Rum or the West," writes a merchant from Alexandria, a
remark illustrative of the European share in this trade.34 The frequent
references to corals sent from Sicily are ambiguous, for in certain
periods Tunisian exports were sent to Egypt via that island.
 Another type of goods most conspicuous in the Geniza records was
pharmaceutical products and preparations. As the science of pharma-
cology was first systematically developed by the Greeks and then
taken over from them by the Muslims, it is natural that many plants
growing in the countries of the ancient Greeks should figure promi-
nently in the stock of a Muslim pharmacy. Thus, dodder of thyme
 (called in Arabic afithimftn, which is Greek epi-thymon, from which
the English thyme is der1ved) was such an important medical plant
that some of the ancients assumed that the art of medicine was in-
vented in the island of Crete, because the best quality of that plant
was found there. We indeed learn from the Geniza records that Crete
epithymon was exported to Egypt, whence it was reexported to the
countries of the Indian Ocean.35·
 Although the Europeans are normally mentioned in our records in
the plural, we do not get the impression that they appeared solely as
compact companies. Thus a letter from Old Cairo speaks about Euro-
pean merchants visiting the writer in his house, and in another, from
Alexandria, we read about a complaint that certain Rum had rented
storehouses belonging to one merchant, but had left for their country
without having paid for them. For reasons not stated, the governor of
the city was not prepared to take action to redress that complaint. 56
 European shipping must have been conspicuous in Alexandria al-
ready in the early years of the eleventh century, for the Italian word
 scala for the plank used at the lading of a boat appears as an official
term in an account from that city written around 1030: "Passing the
isqiilii, 100 bales (pay) 11-½ dinars (export dues)." 37
 There is no need to expatiate here upon the international trade
 between the Muslim countries of the Mediterranean area, for at least
three-quarters of the business letters preserved in the Geniza deal with
 this subject. If we take jnto consideration the extent, instead of the
 number, of the letters concerned, the ratio would be as high as nine-
tenths. It was mostly the international trade that necessitated detailed
 and lengthy records. In view of this, the business relations of the
Muslim countries around the Mediterranean is treated in chapter iii,
which is devoted to commerce and finance in general.
 Because of the dangers and risks connected with seafaring and







traveling in foreign countries, business was largely conducted on the
basis of mutual trust and friendship. The traveler was thus assured
that his local business friends would do everything in their power in
case something happened to him or his merchandise. These ,bonds of
friendship were often strengthened by "diplomatic" marriages between
families in countries far distant from each other. Thus the head of one
of the leading Spanish Jewish families in the eleventh century, Samuel
Lukhtush (a Berber name), was married to a lady from a great house
in Old Cairo, which also had other family ties with Spain. We find
members of the two families traveling between Spain and Egypt during
both the eleventh and twelfth centuries.38 The daughter of Elhanan b.
Shemarya, the president of the Jewish College in Old Cairo, was
married in Tunisia around 1020; Sablan b. Abraham, the leader of the
Iraqi Jewish community in that city, married the daughter of the
Jewish chief judge of Sijilmasa, Morocco, on September 9, 1037; and
the daughter of Niss'im b. Jacob Ibn Shahin (a Persian name), the
leading Jewish scholar of Qayrawan, was married to Joseph, the son of
Samuel ha-Nagid, the Jewish vizier of the Berber king of Granada,
Spain around 1050.39 The representative of the merchants in Old Cairo
during the second quarter of the twelfth century was married to the
sister of a niikhoda, or shipowner, in Aden, South Arabia, while his own
sister was the wife of the representative of the merchants in that
town. 40 Marriages between families living in Palestine, Lebanon, or
Syria and those in Egypt are referred to frequently in the Geniza
records.41 Even slaves, or freedmen doing business for their masters in
different countries, contracted such unions. 42
 There were two other types of marriages connected with interna-
tional trade and travel. An ancient Near Eastern maxim, which is
echoed in French and other European proverbs, advises one to take a
wife only from one's own town and social environment.43 In compliance
with this, young men often were married before they went overseas and
their wives were fetched by them after they had established their
position in the new country, in case, of course, they had not changed
their mind and sent, instead, a letter of divorce.44 Or, a mate would be
selected for a young merchant abroad by a friend traveling home.
Thus, in a letter written in Alexandria "on board the Sultan's ship,"
shortly before it set sail for Spain in May, 1116, the writer expresses
his confidence that he would find the right spouse there for his friend,
while he dissuaded him from looking for a wife in al-Mahdiyya.
Clearly, the friend referred to was an inveterate "1-Vesterner," who
abhorred the idea of marrying an "Eastern" wife and therefore had
prompted his acquaintances to arrange a match for him either in Spain
or in Tunisia. 45
 Contrariwise, the safest way for a young man to build himself a
strong position in a foreign country was to marry a girl from an influ-
ential famHy. Nahray b. Niss'im and Judah Ibn Sighmar, the two







 Tunisian immigrants to Egypt most prominent in the Geniza, are illus-
 trious examples, and lesser luminaries of a similar type, such as Zach-
 ariah b. Tammaro, followed suit. The settlers in the Holy Land did the
 same. The scholar Faral_i b. Dunash (a Berber name) from faraway
 Sijilmasa married a girl from Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, and another
 Maghrebi took one from 'Amman (the capital of present-day Jordan).
 The renegade Samaw'al (Samuel) al-Maghribi tells in his autobiogra-
 phy that his father emigrated from Fez, Morocco, to Baghdad, where
 he married one of t,hree learned sisters from Basra, whose mother be-
 longed to a great family, represented in Iraq as well as in Egypt. 46
 Sometimes we find the opposite situation, when the family back home
 was angry that their relative abroad married a poor girl, instead of
 making the right match. 11 Why did you let them marry you to an
 orphan, who lived in their house and served them," writes a man from
 Palermo, SicHy, to his relative in A1exandria. "Instead I would have
 made them your in-laws." The young man probably had his own reasons
 why he married the orphan instead of one of the daughters of the
 house. 47
These relationships were by no means confined to Muslim countries.
 We learn about Jewish ladies from Egypt who were married in Crete or
 Romania (the European part of the Byzantine Empire) and whose
 children bore Greek names or who had adopted Greek names them-
 selves. The Egyptian doctor settling in Byzantium, ref erred to above,
 page 22, married a native woman there and so did the many Europeans
 who took permanent or temporary domicile in Egypt. Since Jewish
 girls in Europe, but not in Egypt, were given the names of biblical
 heroines, children from such a union would bear double names: "Leah,
 who is called Thana', and Sarah, who is called Sitt al-Kull" were the
 daughters of a scribe from the lands of the Rum. 48
The movement of craftsmen contributed less than that of commerce
 to the lively traffic around the Mediterrean in our period-or, at least,
 we do not hear about the former as much as about the latter. For,
 unlike merchants, artisans had little reason to leave us records about
 their activities. When a Rum furrier, a Spanish shoemaker, or a dyer
 from Tiflis, today Tbilisi, Georgia, are listed as living in Old Cairo, we
 are perhaps justified in assuming that they emigrated in the hope that
 the high standard of their crafts in their countries of origin could serve
 as a recommendation for them while abroad. In documents on indus-
 trial partnerships in Fustat we find two cases of workmen from Tyre,
 one from Jerusalem, one from Damascus, and one from al-Mahdiyya.
 The many complaints against the competition by foreigners (report€d
 p. 85, below) are another direct testimony for the migration of arti-
 sans.49
The trademarks of goods mentioned in our papers are another indi-
 cation that skilled workers must have traveled from one end of the
 Mediterranean world to the other. Talaqan was a town in faraway







northeastern Iran famous for its felt industry. But in the Geniza we find
'falaqan felt exported to Egypt-from Tripoli, Libya. By chance, a
Muslim geographer has preserved the information that this material
was successfully imitated in Qal'a (t ij:ammad), then the capital of Al-
geria. Thus, the felt sent from Tripoli was either a reexport, or, more
likely, was produced there itself. 50 Tustar in southwestern Iran was the
center of a great tcxGilc industry and many of its products appear in our
papers. In three cases registered so far, however, we find Tustari cloths
coming from the West, imported to Egypt by persons called Andalusi;
thus, this cloth must have been produced either in Spain, or in some
country in North Africa.51 A.midis, that is, fabrics made in the style of
Amid, modern Diarbekr in eastern Turkey, were imported to Egypt
from the Muslim West. This testimony of the Geniza has an interesting
counterpart in a notice of a tenth-century Muslim geographer who tells
us that in Amid they made Byzantine linen in the style of Sicily. Both
Sicily and Amid once were parts of the Byzantine Empire. No wonder
that within that state, art traveled from the utmost west to the cast. In
Islamic times, the process was reversed. The craftsmen of the east were
attracted by a flou t·ishing west. It is highly probable that the many
persons called Amidi appearing in the Geniza documents did not actu-
ally hail from that remote city, but were occupied with the manufacture
or sale of fabrics bearing that name. 52 The example most common in the
Geniza for the imitation of foreign material was upholstery from
'fabaristan, the beautiful Persian province south of the Caspian sea,
which was so widely reproduced in Egypt that genuine 'fabaristans
were expressly characterized as such in marriage contracts. A Muslim
antiquarian tells us that workshops producing this material existed in
Fustat, and one inventory of a bride's trousseau lists a 'fabari Ramli,
that is, one made in Ramie, Palestine, or in an Egyptian locality bear-
ing that name. 53
 It stal!,dS to reason that goods with such trademarks normally were
manufadured by local craftsmen (as is the case, for instance, with
Worcester cloth made in the United States). It is, however, probable
that the art of designing them was taught first by artisans from the
countries renowned for their production. This assumption is corrobo-
rated by the fact that so many persons in Egypt and Tunisia bore
Persian names, as attested by the Geniza.
 In the few cases 1n which we actually read about the emigration of
craftsmen, it was either only indirectly connected with their profes-
sions or it had no relationship with them whatsoever. A Byzantine silk
dyer went to Egypt after he had been accused of spoiling a precious
fabric, whereupon he himself was almost tortured to death and his
children were taken away from him as pawns. He hoped to obtain their
ransom with the help of Cairene coreligionists.54 When we find a
silversmith from Ceuta, Morocco, in Sicily and later on in Egypt, and
two other Moroccan silversmiths emigrating as far as Ceylon (via







Aden), we may assume that they fled from the Almohad terror, as is
expressly stated in the first case and may be concluded in the second
from the date of their travel. 55 Egypt was flooded with Syro-
PaJestinian dyers, gJassmakers, and silk-weavers during the eleventh
and twelfth centuries, so that the local artisans complained of competi-
tion. This influx, however, was certainly due to the almost permanent
state of war prevailing in that region. Similarly, when Riim tailors,
cobblers, dyers, and goldsmiths appear in the lists of the poor in Old
Cairo, it looks as if they had gone there simply as refugees. A little
puzzling is the frequent presence of Rum scribes in Egypt throughout
the centuries. Perhaps the reason for this was that the Egyptia n Jews
themselves preferred to choose more lucrative occupations.~
As is well known, the enforced recruiting and transfer of craftsmen
from one part of the caliphs' empire to another were very substantial
 factors in the development of a new, Islamic, style, particul arly in
 architecture. Richard Ettinghausen has drawn our attention to the
possible impact of itineran t artisans on the diffusion of tradition s in
the smaller arts, such as pottery and bookbinding.57 In the Geniza
records we see that craftsmen, for various reasons, at least traveled
widely, which cannot have been without influence on the technique of
work and the style of products. To quote an example from the craft of
copyist: in a Jetter in a hand of exquisite beauty sent from a little town
in Egypt to Old Cairo, the writer asks the addressee to have a scribe
from Rum living there copy out two squires and two leaves in order to
complete a volume for a customer, which he himself had been unable
to do while in the capital. It seems highly unlikely that a man who
betrayed such style even in an everyday letter should have entrusted
the completion of a codex written by him to a fellow copyist whose
hand differed very much from his own. Thus we may assume that the
presence of scribes from Europe in Egypt was conducive to a fusion of
styles, which we are able indeed to observe in the Geniza. The writer of
our letter, as may be gleaned from other details mentioned in it, seems
to have been a Palestinian. 58
This letter leads to another group that contributed so much to the
5nternational quality of the Mediterranean scene during the High
Middle Ages, the scholars. "The wandering scholars" are a phenome-
::ion familiar to any student of the medieval history of Christia n
Europe. 59 In Islam, the "seeking of knowledge" resulted in extensive
travels, which are registered in the biography of practically every
savant of renown. In Judaism, traveling for the sake of study was
common even in antiquity, when Palestine formed the spiritual center
for a diaspora spread over the entire civilized world. Around 200 A.D.,
Babylonia, later known as Iraq, became another great center of learn-
ing, which, in the course of time, outstripped Palestine. Commuting
between these two centers was a constant feature of the pursuit of
knowledge during the early Middle Ages. Later on, these "academies"







 continued to be the goals of any scholar who could afford and who
 dared to make the journey, even if he himself was already an acknowl-
 edged authority. Thus a thirteenth-century French scholar of such
 standing that he had already served as a judge in the Jewish commu-
 nity of Alexandria, Egypt, took the trouble of making the long journey
 to Baghdad, where he died shortly after his arrival. As we may con-
 clude from a dirge full of high praise for him composed by a local poet,
 his scholarship must have made a deep impression at the seat of the
 ecumenical Jewish academies.60
Another good example, antedating the one just cited by two hundred
 years, is provided by the story of Ma~lial) b. Elijah, the Jewish judge
 of Palermo during the second quarter of the eleventh century. He was a
 renowned scholar whose legal opinions were sought and quoted together
 with those of his illustrious colleague in Qayrawan, R. Hananel, one of
 the greatest rabbinical authorities of all time. A volume of the responsa
 of the Sicilian judge was in the possession of an Andalusian mcrchant.61
 Ma~lial;i traveled to Egypt, where he traded in Sicilian silk, as well as
 to Palestine. Finally, he visited Baghdad, in order to study with Hay
 Gaon (d. 1038), "the spiritual father of all the [Jewish] scholars in
 the lands of Islam and Christendom." He was so impressed by the old
 master that he wrote a book about his way of life, one detail of which is
 noteworthy here. Once, Ma~liali asked Hay for the explanation of
 Psalm l41 :5, the text of which is indeed extremely difficult. Hay, who
 had himself written a comprehensive dictionary of Hebrew, was also
 puzzled by an obscure phrase in that verse and sent Ma~lial) on to the
 Catholicus, the head of the Nestorian church. Although such coopera-
 tion between Jewish and Christian biblical scholars is commonplace in
 our own times, one might not expect it to have existed in Baghdad nine
 hundred and fifty years ago. The Sicilian judge dedicated his biography
 of the great "Babylonian" scholar to the vizier Samuel ha-Nagid of
 Granada (see above, p. 48), most probably at the occasion of his visit
 to that Spanish town. 62
Even more significant are the instances of scholars from the es-
 tablished seats of learning who wandered around visiting minor schools
 in order to add to their erudition. Thus we have an interesting letter
 from Alexandria by a "Babylonian" scholar, who, after ransacking the
 booksellers' stores of Egypt for rare books (including one by a Spanish
 author), decided to travel to Thebes and Salonika in Greece, as he had
 learned in Alexandria that they possessed notable schools adorned by
 fine scholars. 63
Linguistic barriers did not deter travelers in search of knowledge.
 Latin in western Europe, classical Arabic in the countries of Islam, and
 Hebrew in the Jewish houses of learning everywhere made it possible
 for foreigners to take part anywhere in classes or even to lead them.
 We read above about the French scholar visiting Baghdad and about a
 Baghdadian traveling to Greece. Hay Gaon, the head of the academy







in Baghdad, had five students from Siponto, a little town in southern
Italy, whose mother tongue was probably Greek or a Romanesque
dialect. Once, when he had to answer a query from Qayrawan about a
Greek legal term occurring in the Talmud, he answered: I asked the
Greek-speaking scholars from Constantinople who study with me, and
they confirmed that the term was still used in the sense found in the
ancient sources.64
 That great masters emigrated to foreign countries and founded new
schools there has long been known from literary sources. It remained,
however, for discoveries from the Geniza to present us with authentic
and intimate accounts about such occurrences. Thus from it we learn
how the famous school of Jewish learning in Qayrawi'i.n was founded at
the end of the tenth century by an emigrant from Byzantine Italy,
then famous for its schools, or how, two generations later, Jewish
learning witnessed a revival in Old Cairo when a leading scholar from
 Tunisia took his residence there.65 Under exceptional circumstances,
the ecumenical academies, too, would choose a foreign scholar as their
head. The most famous cases, of course, are those of Saadya (d. 942)
from the Egyptian Fayyum, who became Gaon in Baghdad, and of
Isaac b. Moses of Spain, who did the same. The Geniza has revealed
 that the most prominent Gaon of the Jerusalem academy of this time,
 Solomon b. Judah (d. 1051), was not a native of Palestine, but origi-
 nated from Fez in Morocco. 66
It was not only the wish to acquire or to spread knowledge which
 caused men of learning to travel far afield, but also the simple need to
 make a living. Geniza papers of all descriptions, such as lists of
 emoluments, official and private correspondence, or legal deeds, indi-
 cate that judges, preachers, teachers, and cantors more often than not
 were of foreign origin. Of the three permanent judges of Cairo and
 Fustat who signed many important documents, one of which, dated
 August 11, 1114, is translated in Mediterranean People, one was an
 Andalusian and the two others originated from Palestine. Each of them
 served in this capacity in the Egyptian capital for about a generation.
 At the same time, the chief Jewish judge of Alexandria was a scholar
 from Der'a, a town in Morocco. 87 Most of the Jewish judges and
 academic teachers active in Egypt during the twelfth century had
 previously occupied similar positions in Palestine or Syria. At the end
 of the same century, Moses Maimonides of Cordova, Spain, was the
 highest legal authority of the Jewish community in the capital of
 Egypt and his opposite number in Alexandria was Anatoli (cf. modern
 French Anatole) of Marseilles who was preceded and followed by other
 judges from the land of the Franks, about whom we shall ·hear more
 later on.88 A fourth Frankish scholar serving as judge in Alexandria
 approximately at that time has been mentioned above, page 52.
The wide geographical distribution of wandering scholars, as reflected
 in the Geniza papers, was not less impressive during the eleventh cen-







tury. In two, comparatively short, lists of scholars on the payroll of the
Cairene community around 1075 the following foreigners are men-
tioned: two Frankish scholars, two from Palestine, two from Baghdad 89
and one from another town in Iraq, six foreign cantors from Spain,
Rum, Tyre (Lebanon), Aleppo, Baghdad and Palestine, respectively, a
teacher from Acre, Palestine, and a scholar called "the son of the
Bunduqi," which, at that time, could hardly mean anything else than
"the man from Venice." The two lists are headed by Nahray b. Nissim,
the Qayrawanese scholar and businessman, who had settled in Egypt
many years before. A third, still unpublished list, of the same type and
time, and also headed by Nahray, includes, in addition to some of those
listed before, one Ibn al-'Ammani, from 'Amman in the country east of
the Jordan, and one :e:ijazi, from northwest Arabia. 70
 Very characteristic in this respect is the following passage from a
letter, addressed by a local scholar to the leader of the Jewish com-
munity in Old Cairo around 1030: "Many scholars come here from the
Land of Edom [Europe] and from Palest5ne. Let me be like one of
them. I am in great straits. Help me." A beautifully styled letter from
Tyre from the later part of the eleventh century contains this complaint
addressed to the Rosh ha-Gola, or Head of the Diaspora, who had his
seat in Baghdad: "Abu Is}:iaq [the head of the local community] takes
care of the Rum [here: Byzantine] and Ifranj [West European] Jews,
as well as of proselytes, but not of me, despit..e your letter." 71
 It would be a mistake to assume that the migrations of the scholarly
profession was confined to the cosmopolitan cities. The Geniza has
preserved a very considerable number of letters from the little towns of
the Rif, or the Egyptian countryside, which reveal that the teachers,
cantors, and notaries there were also to a large extent foreigners, and
that they were not exclusively from Palestine and Syria (although
these formed the majority), but also from more distant countries and
even from the lands of the Franks.72 This fact is less surprising than
might appear at first sight. It tallies well with the general economic
and social importance of the smaller towns in that period, about which
more is said in Mediterranean Society, Volume IV, chapter ix.
 Naturally, the Cairo Geniza has preserved mainly information about
foreigners seeking a livelihood in Egypt. There are also a few examples
of the opposite situation. A young scholar, writing from Tyre, Leba-
non, in October, 1190, informs his parents in Egypt that he had found a
post in Jubayl (on the Lebanese coast, the ancient Byblos) and a wife
in Tyre. He expresses his regret at being separated from his parents,
but explains that he had to accept the position, as he had not found one
at home. 78 The famous Saadya, we remember, also originated in Egypt
and left it only after having become an accomplished scholar, as did
his contemporary Isaac Israeli, one of the great doctors of the Middle
Ages, who became court physician to various rulers of Tunisia.7'
 A further opportunity for far-flung travel was connected with the







 others described so far. Merchants, craftsmen, and scholars alike would
 combine journeys undertaken in their personal interests with pilgrim-
 ages to holy places. The Muslim pilgrimage, of course, far outstripped
 in importance those of the other two religions. In the first place,
 pilgrimage was one of the main religious duties of a Muslim, whereas
in Christianity and Judaism it was only a meritorious deed. Secondly,
 from its very inception, the pilgrimage to Mecca was connected with
the great transcontinental trade and remained so throughout the Middle
Ages. The standing wish for a Muslim pilgrim was: "May your 'IJ,ajj
be accepted, your sin be forgiven and your merchandise not remain
unsold." 75 The impressive development of the Jewish pilgrimage to the
Holy City, as reflected in the Geniza, was at least partly influenced by
the Muslim example, and perhaps the same holds true for the Christian
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which, in the eleventh century, reached ex-
traordinary dimensions.
 The religious and commercial aspects of the pilgrimages are treated
elsewhere in this study. Here, a few examples are quoted showing
pilgrims as bearers of news, letters, and cultural goods. A man from
Tripolitania, Libya, writes to a relative in Alexandria, in 1089, that he
had not written for years inquiring about the addressee's health and
family because he had been receiving reports about him constantly
from the pilgrims-whether Jewish or Muslim, he does not say.76
Yedaya of Narbonne, France, conveyed letters from Cairo to Jerusa-
lem for business friends from Tunisia living in the capitals of Egypt
and Palestine. 77 A pilgrim from the kingdom of Castilia, Spain, carried
with him a compendium of Hebrew lexicography from Jerusalem to
Wargla in the Algerian Sahara. 78 Likewise, "Jacob, the Leonese pil-
grim," brought back with him to Spain a book by a Karaite author
active in Jerusalem. It was soon used by a famous writer living in that
country. 79
 To have made the pilgrimage conveyed an aura of distinction in the
three religions. A letter of recommendation for a cantor states that "he
had sojourned for many years in the Holy Land, in Baghdad and in
Iraq [ !] and had visited the tombs of the saints and the places where
the prophets had wrought miracles." 80 Unlike Muslims, Jews did not
normally bear the title "pilgrim" (Ar. IJ,iijj, Hehr. IJ,ogeg) as permanent
adjuncts to their names. Some women are referred to in the Geniza in
this way, their sons being called "the son of the [female J pilgrim";
perhaps such women had made the pilgrimage unaccompanied by their
husbands, or as widows, which was unusual, as women did not normally
travel alone. 81
 As the passage about the widely traveled cantor indicates, it was not
only the Holy City that attracted pilgrims. All over the Near East,
and, of course, particularly in Palestine, there were places commemo-
rative of biblical heroes or postbiblical saints, which were frequented
by Jews, and the same was the case with Christians and Muslims.







 Sometimes such places were the common goals for the followers of the
 three religions. "I travelled to Iraq and visited our lord Ezekiel [i.e.,
 the alleged tomb of the prophet] and all the saints," writes a native of
 North Africa to his relatives in Old Cairo, and in the same letter he
 recommends to them a notable from Sijilmasa, far back in Morocco,
 who was returning from Baghdad, certainly after having made the
 same piJgrimage. 82 A merchant out in India informs his family in Old
 Cairo that on his way home he would visit the holy places in Iraq and
 then again take to the sea for the travel home. He even asked his
 brother to delay his wedding for this pious purpose.83 Egypt, which had
 witnessed the deeds of Joseph, Moses, and Aaron (some added Elijah
 and Ezra}, naturally also had its sanctuaries and fixed dates for
 pilgrimages. As Egypt was a country of transit for people on their way
 from the West to Palestine, Iraq or India, the existence of these holy
 places did not cause the traveler to go out of his way, as did those in
 Palestine and Iraq.
 Last, but not least, the people of the Mediterranean area moved
 about so much during the High Middle Ages because of the many
 troubles and misfortunes that befell them then. We have just read
 about the scholars roaming about in foreign countries in search of
 appropriate posts. It stands to reason that they would not have taken
 the trouble to seek appointment abroad if they had had opportunity to
 find any at home. The reasons for the economic decline of Tunisia
 during the eleventh century have been explained. It is, therefore, not
 surprising that a most prominent merchant writing from there early in
 that century to a business friend in Egypt should inquire of the latter
 whether he could not help him to emigrate. In another letter from the
 same time and country, the writer congratulates a countryman on
 settling in Egypt, "for," he adds, "the whole [Muslim] West is not
 \\·orth a thing these days." l'-4 A man from strife-torn Syria complains
(beginning of _twelfth century} that people like him could no longer
 live in Damascus-a brother, two sisters, and a cousin of the writer, as
 we know from various sources, had already preceded him to Egypt.85
 Nothing is more illustrative in this respect than the many lists of
 people who were in receipt of alms, in cash or in kind, from the Jewish
 community of Old Cairo. Of the many groups included in them, such as
 invalids, sick or old people, widows and orphans, by far the most
 numerous was that of foreigners from practically every corner of the
 Mediterranean world. The Europeans, the Rum, are very conspicuous
 in them, 86 and in certain periods they were more numerous than all other
 foreigners taken together. Thus, a statement about the distribution of
 loaves of bread, dated October 30, 1107, enumerates under the heading
 11 Al-Rum 11 forty-seven persons, many of whom had one or more de-

 pendents.87 A similar statement, written ten days later, enumerates
 forty-three persons (mostly the same names) under that heading, but
 adds, at the end, that thirteen other Rum, whose names are not speci-







fied, also received loaves. 68 Finally, an undated list, written by the same
hand and containing largely the same names in the sections devoted to
the needy coming from Muslim countries, at the end bears the following
remark: "The Rum are too numerous to be listed." In the sections
specifying names, out of eighty-six households listed, twelve were those
of immigrants from Palestine, while the newcomers from other coun-
tries, ranging from Spain and Sicily to I;Iijaz in North Arabia, appear
singly or in small groups. 89
 It is perhaps noteworthy that the names of Yemenites (Jews from
South Arabia) occur exclusively in the lists of contributors to public
collections, never in those of receivers of alms. This means, of course,
that they had come to Egypt not as refugees, but as merchants,
craftsmen, or scholars.90
 In addition to the great, aJl-comprising calamities and catastrophes,
such as the devastation of Palestine and Syria in the centuries before
and during the Crusades, or the upheavals wrought by the Hila.I and
Sulaym, or by the Almohads in the Muslim West, which caused mass
emigrations, there were countless personal reasons that induced or
forced individuals to be on the move. When anything went wrong, one
followed the maxim "The change of one's domicile brings good luck"
and went abroad. The poor man was confident that in a foreign
country he would find more consideration than at home. "I left our
country many years ago, because I was poor and put my trust in God's
mercy and help" (i.e., in public philanthropy), writes a Jerusalem
pilgrim from the far Muslim West. 91 Even a blind singer would prefer
begging en route to staying at home. 92 When a government official in
Granada, Spain, fell into disgrace, his son preferred to leave the
country, equipped with a huge letter of recommendation given to him
by the local community.93 This happened around 1050. Half a century
earlier, Joseph Ibn Abitur, a great scholar and worthy poet, was at
loggerheads with the chief religious authority of the Spanish Jews. In
order to avoid complications, he went with his sons on the holy pil-
grimage to Jerusalem, but like other famous pilgrims, for example, the
great Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun, remained in Egypt, where quite a
number of his writings have found their way into the Geniza.94 Two
hundred years later, we find the Nagid Abraham Maimonides writing
with his own hand instructions to pay three dirhems a week "to a
worthy Spanish traveler," whom he calls in another note 11 a relative of
the rabbi of Toledo." 95
 The various incentives for travel around the Mediterranean sur-
veyed thus far, such as religious motives, sheer want, and other circum-
stances, often acted in combination. An outstanding example is the
moving story of a scholarly Egyptian Jew who must have been a
bohemian of sorts. "Amassing money," he writes to his son, "as you
know is not one of my characteristics, and when I have some, I eat it
up." From Fustat, where he left a son and three daughters, all, it







 seems, married, he traveled with a second wife and a fourth daughter
 to Jerusalem, for, as he wrote, he wanted to bury his bones in the Holy
 City. He did not die, however, and in those days, the early 1060's, a
 scholar could not find a livelihood in Jerusalem. So, he moved on
 northward to Damascus and other places. Finally, he "despaired of the
 countries of the Muslims" and entered Byzantine territory. There, in
 eastern Asia Minor, he was overtaken by the great invasion of the
 Seljuk Turks, described above, p. 35. He fled westward and did not
 stop for long even in Constantinople, but settled in Salonika. "It is now
 twenty-six years that I left you," he writes to his son, "and during all
 this time I did not find rest in one place for more than thirty months."
 On these arduous travels his daughter perished, but another one was
 born to him and became a beautiful girl. Although Salonika was a
 center of Jewish learning, the old man, who meanwhile had lost his
 eyesight and also had become hard of hearing, proved his mettle in his
 disputations with the local scholars. According to his letter, which is
 written in an optimistic and almost humoristic vein, he was "loved and
 honored by every God-fearing and intelligent person." When his son
 wrote from Fustat, urging him to return to Egypt, he strongly refused,
 while his wife and daughter were eager to accept the invitation. It is
 not difficult to gauge the reason for this antagonism: the women
 remained strangers in the Greek city; the common bond of scholarship
 let the old man feel at home there. 00
Family troubles were another, and perhaps the most common reason
 for long-distance travel. Indelicate as it may sound, it must be
 conceded that running away as far as possible from one's wife was
 practiced as vigorously by the people represented in the Geniza as by
 the husbands in the stories of the Arabian Nights. The Jewish marriage
 contract normally stipulated a relatively high sum to be paid to the
 divorcee, which made a divorce either impossible or, at least, highly
 unpalatable. Consequently, a poor man having marital trouble had
 little choice but to absent himself. 91 In a letter sent from Egypt to
 Seleucia (Silifke) in Byzantine Asia Minor we read that the addressee
 had been away from his wife and daughter for twenty-three years (he
 had been believed dead). His father-in-law speaks to him in terms, as
 if he had absented himself for not more than twenty-three weeks.118 A
 scholar, writing from Palestine to his son-in-law, who had disappeared
 in Egypt, complains bitterly that the latter enjoyed himself with
 Egyptian food and drink-and plays (this word is written above the
 line)-while his wife and children were held as pawns by the Count
(Raymond III) and Countess of Tiberias (around 1080) .99 Even worse
 was the case of a woman from Qayrawan who had been brought by her
 husband to Old Cairo and suddenly discovered that he intended to
 forsake her and to emigrate to another country (around 1040) .100
As a rule, only people from the lower strata of the society, who had
 little to lose by emigration and who were inconspicuous, could dare to







 leave their wives in such a way. For if a fugitive husband was found
 out, he was brought to court, wherever he happened to be. This is
 attested by many documents, mostly powers of attorney given by
 women to persons traveling to countries where their roaming husbands
 were supposed to be. Thus it seems that, whereas in the upper classes
 intermarriage between prominent houses in different countries contrib-
 uted to the unity of the Mediterranean scene, in the lower classes it
 was broken marriages that fed international traffic.


 3. FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION

The shores of the Mediterranean witnessed a continuous coming and
 going throughout the High Middle Ages. How this was achieved, the
 technical, economic, and social aspects of travel and seafaring, are
 discussed in chapter iv. Here, it remains for us to scrutinize the
 historical implications and to determine the effect of political bounda-
 ries on the freedom of movement of either persons, goods, or ideas.·
References to such limitations are conspicuously absent in the Geniza
 papers. Many hundreds of letters and documents speak of travels to,
 or in, foreign countries, but, with a few exceptions, they have nothing to
 say about obstacles put in the way of the traveler for political reasons.
 Naturally, there were wars and actions related to them, such as the
 imprisonment of the Genoese merchants in Egypt at a time of the great
 attacks of the Genoese fleets on the coasts of Palestine and Syria, de-
 scribed above, page 45. Literary sources tell us about savage acts of
 retaliation against the merchants of Amalfi in Old Cairo, who were
 suspected of having set fire to the new ships of the Fatimid navy in May,
 996.1 In Saladin's time; we read about three poor foreigners who lived in
 hiding, and, when denunciated as "enemies of the king," were thrown
 into prison where two of them perished. In the same period, in a letter
 sent from Alexandria to Aden, the writer expresses the apprehension
 that the Mfir, or superintendent, of the port would not give him per-
 mission to sail, because he regarded him as suspicious for the mere
 reason that he had arrived on a Frankish boat.2 Such occurrences were
 definitely exceptional. Traveling on Italian ships had become absolutely
 commonplace for Jews from Muslim countries in the twelfth century,
 and, as is well known, the Spanish Muslim geographer Ibn Jubayr
 traveled from Morocco to Egypt and from Palestine via Sicily to Spain
 on Christian ships at a time (1183-1185) when the tension between the
 two religions was at its height. 3
Nowhere do we read in the Geniza records that visits by foreigners
 were limited in time or confined to certain localities, as was the case in
 Byzantium, at least in certain periods. Fatimid Egypt was flooded by
 merchants from Sunnite Tunisia at a time when there was open friction
 between the governments of the two countries; these visitors were







granted free access to the most remote places of both Lower and Upper
Egypt, where they could inspect and buy the local products. Indeed,
while reading the Geniza letters of this period, one forgets that politi-
cal boundaries existed at all. To add just one example of extended
travel to the many given above: In a letter of recommendation, written
by the Gaon, or Head of the Academy, in Jerusalem, the highest Jewish
religious authority at that time, we read: "The bearer of these lines is
a man called . . . from the country of Khorasan. He brought me a
letter oi recommendation from a merchant in Seville called.... He is
now proceeding to Egypt." 4 Khorasan, in Car northeastern Iran, pro-
duced textiles, especially ibrisim silk, which were exported to the West.
At the time of this letter, we find a consignment of Khorasanian silk on
its way via Aleppo and Tyre to Egypt and a merchant from Qayrawan
traveling to his native city together with some Iranian merchants to
whom he owed the large sum of 300 dinars, to be paid to them after
arrival.5 Thus it is not surprising that a merchant from that distant
country should have accompanied his merchandise as far as Spain.
Because the pilgrimage to Jerusalem was eagerly observed by Spanish
Jews, the Head of the Academy knew the more prominent Jewish
notables of Seville personally, or at least had corresponded with them.
Still, su<lh far-flung travels by ordinary people suggest that the many
frontiers that they had to cross on their way could not have constituted
a serious impediment.
 We also hear very little of embargoes on the exp~rt of goods and
nothing about a ban on imports. Occasionally, such embargoes were
imposed, for example, in Tunisia, on oil and oil products, its main
agricultural export, perhaps in times of scarcity or of imminent wars,
when stores had to be laid in. 6 Iron, the war material par excellence, so
common a merchandise on the Indian Ocean, is all but absent from the
Mediterranean Geniza papers. Once, when it is mentioned, the refer-
ence is made in Hebrew, which suggests that the trade in this commod-
ity was not free. 7 But such cases are exceptional. Rather more common
was the opposite situation, namely the prerogative of the local govern-
ment to buy first. A man sending 20 millstones from Palestine to Egypt
hoped to make a good profit, but was afraid that the millstones would
be seized by the government. 8 Lead and wax, coming from the West,
would be bought up by the authorities in Alexandria, and the ships
were not allowed to unload before they had made their decision.•
Precious textiles would also attract the attention of the luxury-loving
courts, whether in Egypt or in Tunisia, and sometimes, the covetous-
ness of a local ruler proved to be oppressive.10 Such practices were not
frequent, and, quite the contrary in certain periods, we find that the
merchants were eager to sell, for example, their silk, to the government
agencies.u
 Money, too, enjoyed a remarkable degree of free circulation. Coinage
was, of course, the prerogative of the rulers, and, in times of political







 upheavals, such as the conquest of Egypt by the Fatimids, or the re-
 pudiation of the Shi'ite government of Egypt by Tunisia seventy years
 later, heavy monetary restrictions were imposed. In normal times, how-
 ever, money was a commodity that could be traded everywhere. As is
 the case with any merchandise, some coins had a better market in cer-
 tain places than in others, and, in addition, some currencies, such as the
 Fatimid, and later on, the Almoravid gold dinar as well, were interna-
 tional means of payment comparable to the U.S.A. dollar of our times.
 When an octogenarian from Amul, the capital of Tabaristan south of
 the Caspian Sea, left his hometown in order to conclude his life where
 his father had found his last rest (presumably in .Jerusalem), he took
 one hundred and fifty Maghreb dinars with him to Baghdad where he
 handed them over to a renowned banker for a draft on an equally
 famous banking house in Old Cairo. 12 It is not difficult to explain, how
 so much "western" money traveled eastward. Tabaristan upholstery
 held absolute sway over the western markets ( cf. above p. 50). Still, the
 caliphs of Baghdad were the professed enemies of the Fatimids, who
 were the issuers of the dinars carried by that old man. This only shows
 that political boundaries were no obstacle for money, as long as it was
 good.
It should also be noted that foreigners were obviously free to acquire
 real estate wherever they wished. Thus we find that a merchant from
 Almeria, Spain, possessed a house in Fez, Morocco. We learn about this
 wheri his son, for reasons explained on page 62, preferred not to use
 it, but stayed with local friends. 13 It must have been a common thing
 ior a merchant from Tunisia to own a house in Old Cairo.u We also
 hear of the case of a person having a little house in Palermo, Sicily,
 and another in Damsis, Egypt, where his wife lived. 15 A prominent
 notable like Nahray b. Nissim possessed houses in Qayrawan, Alexan-
 dria (about which we hear much), Old Cairo, and Jerusalem (also
 mentioned repeatedly), the last three, it seems, at one and the same
time. It is most remarkable that even a mu'ahid, a Jew from a
 Christian country who had the status of a foreigner, could acquire real
 estate in Fustat, as is proved by a tenth-century documcnt. 16
All the evidence available from the Geniza records taken together, it
 seems admissible to characterize the Mediterranean area in the period
 under discussion as a free-trade community. To be sure, there were
countless customs stations all over the place. But these were found by
no means only at the frontiers, but at the gates of any sizable town.
According to Muslim canonical law, non-Muslims were obliged to pay
a double rate of customs duties. This law was certainly not enforced in
Fatimid times, since nowhere in the Geniza records is any reference
made to its existence in this period. Saladin tried to reenact that
 ancient discrimination, but was soon forced to abandon the idea. So.me
 allusions to these changes in Muslim sources find their explanation in a
 Geniza report from Alexandria about an edict by Saladin, promulgated







 by the governor of that city, to the effect that Jews and Christians,
 both local and foreign, "pay only one half of the customs," that is,
 were again made equal to Muslims in this respect. 11
Sometimes, we hear of special customs dues for foreigners, for exam-
 ple, in Sicily, shortly before the termination of Muslim rule over that
 island, as well as in Morocco. The young man from Almeria, Spain, of
 whom we have read that he preferred to stay with friends instead of in
 the house belonging to his own family, did so in order to be able to
 declare the merchandise carried by him as destined for a local mer-
 chant. As we shall see (p. 344, below), cheating and evading the
 payment of customs is rare in the Geniza papers, presumably because
 customs rates were generally reasonable. The imposition of special
 dues for foreigners was obviously regarded as objectionable, and for
 Sicily, at least, we learn that it was soon rescinded.
It would be misleading to speak about passports in this period. Jews
 and Christians from Muslim countries, where they were compelled to
 pay a yearly poll tax, had to carry with them a certificate showing that
 they had fulfilled their duty. Otherwise, they would have had to pay a
 second time. But in this respect, too, there was no difference between a
 foreigner and a native person of the same status. No Jew or Christian
 in Egypt could travel from one place to another without carrying with
 him such a certificate.18
Foreigpers coming from a non-Muslim country naturally had to pay
 for the protection granted them. From a Geniza document we learn
 that this special tax was incumbent even upon persons brought to
 Muslim territory against their own will, namely when captured by
 pirates. In such a case, which occurred in or around 1026, the tax
 amounted to 2.5 dinars per person, a substantial, but still reasonable
 amount.19 This tax was essentially the same as the poll tax paid by the
 local "protected people," the Jews and the Christians. The protection
 given to foreigners, the Geniza informs us, was as efficient as any given
 to the local population: it worked well when one had influential friends
 who saw to it that it worked.
Another field in which the foreigner was seemingly discriminated
 against was the fate of his belongings in case he died abroad. This vast
 problem of the seizure of the estates of foreigners by local rulers was
 the subject of various international treaties and is echoed in the Geniza
 records in many different forms. This tribulation, too, was not specific
 to foreigners, but concerned in general the estates of persons who died
 without heirs or without their heirs being present or able to submit
 their claims. In the unruly France of the eleventh century, a local
 potentate would seize the property of a native old man after his son
 had been murdered, under the pretext that, in any case, he now would
 have no heir to succeed him. 20 At the same time, in the contemporary
 Fatimid empire, the salvaged goods of a drowned foreign merchant
 would be turned over by the authorities to the court of his religious







 community in order to be transmi~ted to his legal heirs in a distant
 country. 21 Contrariwise, under the less liberal regime of the Ayyubids,
 a person whose family was not with him at the time of his demise had
 to face the dire prospect that his property would be confiscated-a case
 particularly frequent in Jerusalem where old people used to spend the
 end of their days in devotion, far away from their families. 22 When we
 find in our records that traders going abroad were often accompanied,
 followed, or preceded, by sons, brothers, nephews, or other relatives, in
 many cases the aim was not only assistance, but also a safeguard for
 one's estate in the event of death. Still, we never hear that the dread of
 confiscation of one's goods acted as a deterrent to travel overseas.
The facts presented so far in this and the preceding sections should
 by no means induce us to believe that the society speaking to us
 through the Geniza records was a crowd of cosmopolitans with no roots
 and no attachment to their country of provenance. Strange as it may
 appear after all the talk of travel, the opposite is true. We find the
 most outspoken testimonies of devotion to the writers' countries and
 native cities and to the people originating from them. After having
 lived for seventeen years in Egypt, the silversmith from Ceuta, Mo-
 rocco, whose letter is translated in Mediterranean People, still describes
 himself as a foreigner and expects help only from his compatriots,
 although, at that time of the Almohad terrors, Morocco was Hell and
 Egypt, as the writer says, using a biblical phrase, "the land of life." 23
 N ahray b. Niss Im, who passed more than fifty years of his life in
 Egypt always regarded himself as a Maghrebi and was expected by his
 compatriots to exert himself first and foremost on their behalf.24 A
 devout Byzantine "mourner of Zion" writes from Jerusalem: "Per-
 haps God will some day bring me back to my home and 'the inherit-
 ance of my fathers.' " 25 The same biblical expression is used by an-
 other Jerusalem pilgrim with regard to his native Morocco: "May the
 Creator of the world presently let us meet together in joy, when I
 return under his guidance to my homeland and the inheritance of my
fathers." 26 Similarly, Joseph lbn Abitur, the Spanish scholar and poet,
 who was stranded in Egypt (cf. above p. 57), speaks longingly of Spain
as "my homeland and my native country." 27
This psychological attachment to one's home country was reflected
 in the legal situation. It took a long time until a person was naturalized
in his new domicile. The scholars from Palestine, who served in the
 little towns of Egypt as teachers, cantors, and notaries, were obliged to
appear every year in Cairo in order to pay their poll tax to the
 Syro-Palestinian poll-tax office. We hear about this in particular under
al-Malik al-Ka.mil (1218-1238), one of the successors of Saladin, at a
 time when Egypt and Syria were united, at least theoretically, in one
 state. "Our schoolteacher cannot pay his tax here in Minyat Zifta,"
 says a letter, addressed to the Nagid Abraham Maimonides, "for he is
 a Palestinian. When the time of the payment arrived, he had to leave







for Cairo." 28 Even more telling is the case of the judge Elijah b.
Zachariah, concerning whom and his ramified family a very large
number of records has been preserved. He originated from Palestine,
but had been living for such a long time in Alexandria that he was
regularly called "the Alexandrian." Later on he became judge in Old
Cairo, where he must have been very popular, for he is often styled
"the judge of the Jews," although other judges are known to us as
having held office together with him. Yet even his son, a cantor and
teacher in Old Cairo, still had to register at the poll-tax office for
Palestinians. 29 Still more impressive is the following detail from a
letter to Elijah by another son of his, an army doctor. After having
informed him of great changes that had taken place in both Muslim
and Jewish Alexandria, he implies that his father had good prospects
of becoming the Jewish chief justice of Alexandria, although a certain
prominent man (either the Muslim governor or a Jewish notable) does
not like Palestinians-and this after so many years of distinguished
service in the two main cities of Egypt! 30 This important subject of
local patriotism versus cosmopolitanism is discussed more fully in the
concluding chapter of this study (Vol. IV, chap. x).
 Fortunately, local patriotism was no impediment to the free circula-
tion of ideas and books. I was very much impressed, when, in a lis~ of
books left by a deputy judge in a small town in Lower Egypt, I found
mention of a bound volume of responsa by a Spanish Jewish scholar
who had died only a few years before that judge, and, as far as is
known, had never traveled to the East.31 In Mayence, the ancient
Roman town on the banks of the Rhine, Germany, it was possible, in
the temh century, to find not only all the more important spices of
India and the Far East (as reported by the Spanish-Jewish traveler
mentioned p. 27, above), but also a man able to translate a book of
instructions for Bible cantillation from Arabic into Hebrew-and this
fact is by no means stated as something extraordinary .32 The transla-
tor, or his father, had come from Italy, where Greek, Latin, Arabic,
and Hebrew were at that time used side by side. It is therefore not
surprising that the classical thesaurus of postbiblical Hebrew (which
contains many elements derived from, or akin to, the three other
languages) should have been written in Rome. It is remarkable that
not many years after that great dictionary was written, we find a
merchant from Old Cairo, who happened to be in Tlem~en, Algeria,
asking his business correspondent in Almeria, Spain, to procure a copy
for him. The latter found one in Ceuta, Morocco, which was frequented
in those days by Italian ships.33
 It is natural that ideological clashes should be accentuated, or even
created, by the contrast of the state of civilization or the frame of mind
prevailing in different countries. Maimonides' philosophical chef
d'oeuvre, written in Egypt, was banned and burned by the Jews of
France, most of whom had little use for the spirituality of Greek







philosophy. To the contrary, French rabbis, coming out to the Muslim
East, although much sought after because of their great Jewish learn-
ing, sometimes became the target of ridicule and even insult because of
their plainly literal approach to the Bible and their lack of refinement
in things theological. 34 The great Persian Muslim theologian al-
Ghazali (d. 1111) was hailed in the East as the renewer of Islam, but
in Almoravid Morocco and Spain his books were condemned and
publicly burned. This condemnation, although deeply rooted in the
mentality and traditions of the local Muslim scholars, did not last very
long, for the Almohad turnabout established al-Ghazali's authority in
the West as well. In any case, the very facts that Maimonides' books
were burned in France and those of al-Ghazali in Spain, demonstrate
how far and unimpededly books traveled in those times and how
influential they became even in distant countries. No one, except fools,
takes the trouble to burn irrelevant books.
 The most eloquent testimony to the freedom of movement in the
 Mediterranean area during the High Middle Ages was the religious and
 public life of the religious community represented in the Geniza papers.
 Regular contributions were made by the Jewish congregations all over
 the Fatimid empire for the benefit of the two great Jewish seats of
 learning in Baghdad. Likewise, collections were held in the Jewish com-
 munities of the Sunni West, in Spain and North Africa, for the academy
 in Jerusalem, a town under Fatimid rule. Similarly, donations were
 sent to Baghdad and Jerusalem from Christian countries, for example,
 from Lucca in northern Italy, from Narbonne and Montpellier in
 France and Mayence in Germany. All these communities submitted
 their questions concerning matters of faith, rite, or civil law to the
 heads of those schools, and countless replies, often given after joint
 deliberations of all the scholars present, the responsa, have been pre-
 served. As a result of all this, the Jewish church, despite the enormous
 dispersion of its members, has remained or become amazingly uniform
 i t1 its basic liturgy, in its religious practice, and in whatever secular
 legislation it was permitted to apply. It is perhaps characteristic of
 the age that the Karaite heresy also was able to spread from its coun-
 tries of origin, Iraq and Persia, to Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, to
 Byzantium, where it became very influential, as well as to the Muslim
 West, including even Christian Spain. It seems that Wargla, deep south
 i t1 the Algerian Sahara, which was a great center of the Muslim sect of
 the Ibi'i.c;lites, was also a stronghold of Karaism. 115
 There is even more to this. The Gcniza records abundantly prove
 that the higher officials of the Jewish communities, such as judges,
 community leaders, heads of local schools, and the like, were ap-
 pointed, or approved in their appointment, by the religious authorities
 in Jerusalem or Baghdad, or both, although, in most cases, more than
 one frontier had to be crossed to obtain such an appointment or
 approval. This interplay between local and ecumenical public author-







ity is discussed in Mediterranean Society, Volume II, chapter v. Suffice
it to say here that, thus far, not a single instance has been found in our
papers where the governments of the countries concerned interfered in
this procedure, which was not merely a formality, but had a tangible
influence on the life of their Jewish subjects. The Christian communi-
ties in Islamic countries were in a similar situation, although their
generally larger size, their organization in rivaling churches, and their
natural connection with the Christian powers of Europe entailed modi-
fications.
 To sum up: during the High Middle Ages men, goods, money, and
books used to travel far and almost without restrictions throughout the
Mediterranean area. In many respects, the area resembled a free-trade
community. The treatment of foreigners, as a rule, was remarkably
liberal. The close connection among all parts of the Jewish diaspora,
expressed in contributions to, and spiritual and organizational depend-
ence upon, ecumenical religious authorities in faraway countries was
not regarded by the governments of the various states concerned as an
infringement on their sovereignty.
 How is all this to be explained? To a certain extent, by the fact that
the machinery of the state was relatively loose in those days, that is,
the technique of making life unbearable was not yet as perfected as it
is in our own days. One should not however, strain this point too much.
There is plenty of evidence in the Geniza records as well as in Arabic
sources that the governments kept a vigilant eye on foreigners and also
that they often had opportunity to occupy themselves with the inner
affairs of the non-Muslim communities. Officially appointed spies and
the secret police saw to it that visitors from foreign countries did not
evade their customs duties and did not engage in any activity detri-
mental to the state. Quarrels between individuals and communal strife
often invoked the intervention of the governments or their local
officials. Thus, it was not so much the looseness of the machinery of the
state as positive factors that contributed to the amazing degree of the
freedom of movement and to the comparatively close unity of the
Mediterranean wo::ld.
 At the root of all this was the concept that law was personal and not
territorial. An individual was judged according to the law of his reli-
gious community, or even religious "school" or sect, rather than that
of the territory in which he happened to be. Perhaps it would be even
more exact to say that, with the exception of some local statutes,
promulgated and abrogated from time to time, the states as such did
not possess any law. These were the preserves of the religions and their
various subdivisions. For Jews in Spain or France to seek "High Court
decisions" in Jerusalem or Baghdad, or, later on, with Maimonides
and his successor in Cairo, was the normal and natural thing to do. It
would hardly occur to an American judge of our own days to try to
make a livelihood by exercising his profession while traveling around







 the globe. For nowhere outside the United States, nay outside his own
 state in the U.S., would he be able to obtain an appointment. Ibn
 Battuta, however, the great Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century,
 made his way from Morocco to China and back, while dispensing
 Mii.liki law (he also engaged in business, as befitted a judge in those
 days). This is a brand of Muslim law which was widely accepted in
 North Africa, but comparatively rare elsewhere, and therefore a scholar
 of the caliber of Ibn Battuta was welcomed by the scattered Miliki
 communities and engaged by them as judge.
Similarly, we have seen that the Egyptian Jewry often procured its
 judges and other community officials from foreign and even very dis-
 tant countries almost during the whole of the classical Geniza period.
 The great influx of Jewish scholars from France, as from 1200, is
 particularly significant, for with them a threefold difficulty existed:
 they were often not fluent in Arabic, and, as judges, had to take
 recourse to interpreters, a procedure not permitted by Jewish law;
 secondly, in France the Jews enjoyed less legal autonomy than in
 Egypt, with the consequence that these scholars, with all their learned-
 ness, had little experience with the practical application of their
 knowledge, as far as civil law was concerned; and finally, there was the
 discrepancy in theological conceptions described above. No wonder
 that after the death of Anatoli of Marseilles, judge in Alexandria (see
 p. 53, above), a dissident party in that town produced an ancient
 statute to the effect that no French or Byzantine Jew should be
 appointed as judge in that town. It turned out, however, that the
 statute invoked did not disqualify foreigners as such, but only those
 who were not fluent in the language of the country. As a matter of fact,
 another scholar from France, fluent in Arabic, was appointed as Anato-
 li's successor.36 Sometimes, it was even advantageous for the foreigner
 not to know the local vernacular. Thus, one cantor writes to another,
 while most warmly recommending to him his revered teacher, a Jewish
 scholar from France: "Arrange for him to get an appointment as a
 cantor; since he does not know the language of this country, he can
 never become dangerous to you as a competitor." 31
The mounting arrivals of Jews from France who either came to stay
 in Egypt or expected to be equipped there with the means for proceed-
 ing to the Holy Land, became a heavy burden on the Egyptian com-
 munities. In a letter from Alexandria, dated May 15, 1235, we read: "A
 boat has arrived from Marseilles after a voyage of 25 days. Miisi, the
 parchment-maker, who traveled in it-you know him-told us that a
 huge crowd of our coreligionists prepare themselves to come--may God
 guard us from the troubles they cause! This is an exact information
 about which there is no doubt." 38 In another letter from Alexandria,
 which is highly interesting because of adventures in Tarsus (then the
 capital of Little Armenia) reported in it, the writer asks his corre-
 spondent to take care of a refugee, scion of a most noble family from







 Sicily, since the Alexandrian community was fully occupied with pro-
 viding help for a large group of coreligionists from France.39 There are
 many more references in the Geniza to this population movement. But
 nowhere has a hint been found that the Egyptian government impeded
 or discouraged this inflow of people from a country whose rulers, as the
 events of 1219 and 1249 showed, were intent on the conquest of Egypt
 itself.
Foreigners were admitted even to government service. I do not refer
 here to the practice of the Fatimids and other rulers of acquiring able
 slaves from distant countries and promoting them to high and highest
 positions of confidence, but to the employment of members of the free
 civil population in the khidma, or government service. A document
 from spring, 1140, tells about a Jew from Sicily (which by then had
 been under Christian domination for two generations) who was ap-
 pointed to a government office in Cairo, but incurred an unforeseen
 difficulty. He had married a woman in Damascus and the latter refused
 to follow him to his new domicile, while the government regulations
 required that the officials should live with their families in the city in
 which they were employed.40
In his delightful Byzantine Civilization, Steven Runciman tells how
 the patriarch of Alexandria (in Fatimid Egypt) spent several weeks
 with the Byzantine emperor Basil II in 1016) acting as mediator between
 the emperor and the patriarch of Constantinople!1 This reminds the
 student of the Geniza of the French scholar Meir b. Baruch, who,
 around 1220, was influential enough with the Jews of Old Cairo to
 induce them to recognize as "exilarch" a m~n from a Damascene family
 claiming descent from the House of David. It is characteristic that,
 despite this inftuenUal position, Meir's knowledge of the language of
 the country was not sufficient to enable him to read Maimonides' philo-
 sophical work i~ the Arabic original. When he read it in a Hebrew
 translation, he was favorably impressed, but asked, that his own stu-
 dents, who had accompanied him and his brother from France, should
 not be shown the book, as they were not prepared for such mental
 treats.42 Approximately at the same time (Jan., 1207), the support of
 a local judge in Wasit, Iraq, by a Frankish Jew was sufficient to make
 it difficult for the Gaon of Baghdad to depose him.41
It is hardly necessary to quote Geniza texts to prove that the same
 law was applied to the members of one religious community through-
 out the Mediterranean area, irrespective of the country in which they
 happened to live. Examples appear in this book in many different
 contexts. A few specific instances may illustrate the situation. A series
 of transactions, which had taken place in Qayrawan, al-Mahdiyya,
 Sfax (Tunisia), and Palermo, involving merchants called Barqi (from
 Barqa in Libya), 'fara.bulusi (Tripoli}, and Andalusi (Spain) formed
 the object of a settlement before the rabbinical court in Old Cairo in
 spring, 1040, simply because some of the litigants happened to be







present in that city. 44 A power of attorney, made out in Denia, Spain,
was "validated" in al-Mahdiyya, revalidated in Alexandria, and, finally
accepted as a legally valid instrument in the capital of Egypt. This
cumbersome procedure was necessary because the original witnesses
from Spain had traveled only as far as Tunisia, while one of the wit-
nesses of al-Mahdiyya was available in Alexandria, where the signature
of the Jewish judge of al-Mahdiyya was also known.i 5 Another incident
connecting Spain and Egypt is particularly telling. A person who had
been excommunicated by the Jewish authorities in four cities of Spain,
Granada, Lucena, Cordova, and Seville, tried what other people had
done in similar circumstances: he vanished and traveled to Egypt.
There, however, he was met by other people from Spain who demanded
from the Jewish judge of Alexandria to pronounce on him the ban there.
The judge hesitated, for he was informed that the man would defect to
Islam if he received the same treatment in Egypt he had experienced
in his home country. Under these circumstances his adversaries ap-
proached the Nagid, or Head of the Jewish community in the Fatimid
empire, with the request to pronounce the ban against that man and to
instruct the judge in Alexandria to do the same. The Geniza letter tell-
ing this story was sent by special messenger from Alexandria to Cairo,
urging the addressees ( also foes from Spain of the excommunicated
man) to deliver to the Nagid all the documents connected with the case
and to see to it that action was taken without delay.46
 The last two incidents reveal that the contacts between the western-
most and the eastern corners of the Mediterranean cannot have been
too close after all. The very fact that people tried to evade their
obligations toward their families, or creditors, or communities by
fleeing to another country proves the precariousness of communica-
tions. Despite the existence of a direct shipping line between Spain and
Egypt, going east for a prolonged period meant a severe loosening or
even severing of the ties with the people back home. A young merchant
from Badajoz in southwestern Spain (near the Portuguese border) who
was active in Jerusalem, as well as in Tyre, Aleppo, and other cities of
Syria, writes to a business friend in Fustat, enclosing a letter to his
family: "Perhaps one of the merchants from Toledo or one of the
pilgrims returning to Madrid is prepared to convey the letter, for my
brother and my father used to commute to Madrid. Or, there may be
with you even a letter to me from my family, if they believe tha.t I am
still alive." Thus writes a man who was an eager letter writer (we
possess four, written during a short period, and others are referred to in
these, including one confirming that he had heard once from his fam-
ily):" In view of such sparseness of communication, the legal auton-
omy and unity of the various religious communities is the more re-
markable.
 The relative independence of the law (which was religious) of the
state was paralleled by, and had partly its origin in, the freedom of







economy from state interference. The law of Islam, as that of Judaism,
was mainly the creation of scholars of the middle class who were
economically independent and, as a rule, not in the service of any
 government. The eighth and ninth centuries had witnessed this rise of a
large and powerful merchant class all over the Middle East. During
 the tenth through the twelfth centuries, this class was the main bearer
 of Muslim civilization, including its Jewish and (Oriental) Christian
 enclaves. At the same time, the Italian and other Mediterranean mer-
 chants on the European shores emerged into the full light of history.
 However, while in Europe the merchant class obtained political power,
 expressed either in the local autonomy of free cities, or in the creation
 of city states, no such developments took place in the Muslim world.
 This contrast, which accounts so much for the difference between
 progressing Europe and an East lagging behind, was not yet felt very
 tangibly during the period considered here. At that time, a vigorous
 merchant class was active on both sides of the Mediterranean and
 created an atmosphere of unity despite the constant wars and political
 upheavals, and, owing to the relatively great freedom of the economy
 from state interference, people were less involved, when their rulers
 were at loggerheads with each other. This state of affairs was recog-
 nized by a keen contemporary observer, the Spanish traveler Ibn
 Juba.yr. After having described, how, at the time of heavy fighting
 between Muslims and Christians, Muslim caravans passed safely
 through Crusaders' territory or moved to seaports held by Christians,
 he concludes:
"Likewise, in Muslim territory, none of the Christian merchants is
 forbidden entrance or is molested. The Christians impose a tax on the
 Muslims in their land, which gives them utmost security, while the
 Christian merchants also pay [customs] for their goods in the land of
 the Muslims. Reciprocity prevails and equal treatment in all respects.
 The warriors are engaged in their wars, while the people are at
 ease." .a


 4. THE GENIZA PEOPLE AS REPRESENTATIVE
OF MEDITERRANEAN SOCIETY
It would be hazardous to use letters and documents left by European
Jews of the Late Middle Ages for an overall picture of the society to
which they belonged. For that was a time of intolerance when they led
a life of seclusion, separated and almost sealed off from their environ-
ment. Not so with regard to the Mediterranean society of the period
with which we are concerned here. Despite the high degree of legal and
civic autonomy enjoyed by them at that time, and despite their status
as semiforeigners, which they shared with the Christians in the realm
of Islam and which was even more accentuated in Europe, in this







period they mingled freely with their neighbors and, therefore, cannot
have been very much different from them. For, as the Arab proverb has
it, "people are more akin to their contemporaries than they are to their
own forefathers." 1 It stands to reason that a twelfth-century Jewish
doctor, who worked in a government hospital in Cairo or Aleppo, was
in most respects representative of the medical profession of his time in
general, while a Jewish glassmaker, or silk-weaver, or metal founder
would use the same techniques and occupy approximately the same
social position as his Christian or Muslim fellow workers. Mutual help,
as expressed in small, but not too small, loans, is attested in the Geniza
as prevailing between members of different faiths but of the same or
similar professions.2
It is instructive to compare a strictly isolated Jewish community,
such as the Jews of Yemen in southern Arabia had been up to their
mass exodus in 1949-1950, with that known to us through the Geniza
from the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Yemenite Jews lived in
entirely secluded quarters or villages.3 The Geniza records, too, make
occasional mention of quarters predominantly inhabited by Jews, or
even called "the Jewish quarter." But these were not ghettos. Every-
where, whether in Old Cairo or in Qayrawan, in Damascus or in
Jerusalem, or in Egyptian provincial capitals, we would find in the
deeds preserved that Jewish houses, even in so-called Jewish quarters,
happened to border on those owned by Muslims or Christians, or both.
Even more so: Gentiles used to rent apartments and rooms belonging
to the Jewish community chest and situated in the neighborhood of
synagogues.•
The domestic architecture of the Jewish town house in Yemen was
entirely different from that of the Muslims. The Jewish house was of
the ancient Mediterranean type, with an inner court in the second floor,
and it hardly ever had more than two and a half floors. The Muslim
house imitated the local southern Arabian multistory fortress and often
actually· served as such. Each community built according to its own
traditions and its social and economic exigencies. 5 We never hear about
such differences in the Geniza, nor could they have existed, since houses
built by Muslims and Christians often were acquired by Jews. This
explains also why special women's quarters, ~aramiyya, required by
Muslim, but not by Jewish, social habits, are sometimes mentioned in
documents referring to houses possessed by Jews.' In nineteenth-cen-
tury Baghdad, Christian and particular Jewish houses were different
 from Muslim by the absence of this dichotomy.'
The clothing of the Yemenite Jew was distinct from that of his
neighbors in every single detail. In the Fatimid empire, it seems, not
even the canonical rules for the wearing of distinctive badges by non-
Muslims were regularly observed. The fantastic ordinances in this
respect by the caliph al-l;Ukim were soon forgotten; in any case, they
have left no trace in the Geniza. A renewal of these discriminatory laws







 is reported in a lengthy document from the year 1121, but from Bagh-
 dad, not from Cairo. 8 Abundant evidence shows that both Jewish males
 and females indulged in the most gorgeous fabrics and colors, the like
 of which would please, and actually be offered to, Muslim governors
 or sultans.
When a delegation of Arabian Jews visited the Umayyad caliph
 Mu'awiya (661-680 A.D.), his first question was whether they still
 knew how to prepare the delightful haris dish which the caliph remem-
 bered to have enjoyed while he himself was .still in Arabia.9 The answer
 was to the affirmative (some of them still have it as a Sabbath dish and
 call it by the same name as 1,300 years back). So far, nothing about a
 special Jewish kitchen has come to light from the Geniza, although the
 prohibition of cooking fresh food on Saturday must have led to the
 creation of some specialities. On the other hand, the Jews were rather
 prominent in the general food industry (see pp. 100 ff., below). Need-
 less to say, the Jews used the same money, the same general goods, and
 the same means of locomotion as other people.
Unlike later medieval Europe, where murderously discriminative
 economic restrictions confined the Jews to a few unproductive occupa-
 tions, in the world reflected in the Geniza, we find them in practically
 all arts and crafts, including agriculture. Naturally, they were more
 prominent in some than in others. The attachment of particular ethnic
 or religious groups to certain occupations has been common in the
 Middle East down to our own times and is not unfamiliar to the
 contemporary scene in the United States. H is, however, important to
 note that both the Geniza and Muslim literary sources show us that
 Gentiles also engaged in all the ways of making a livelihood which
 were adopted by Jews. In commerce, the Jews were prominent in
 textiles, dyeing, and pharmaceutical products, as well as in metals. But
 they traded in many other commodities as well. The methods of
 business, too, cannot have been peculiar to a particular religious group,
 for commerce was normally interfaith and, to a large extent, interna-
 tional. In certain cases, as with regard to the most important institu-
 tion of partnership, we hear expressly that its Muslim, and not Jewish,
 legal form was mostly applied even when the contracts were made
 before a Jewish court. Partnerships between Muslims and Jews, both
 industrial and commercial, were nothing exceptional. Even the doctors
 of law, whose subject matter was essentially denominational, worked
 closely together, for cases often went back and forth from a Muslim to
 a Jewish court or vice versa. Sometimes, such professional contacts
 developed into personal friendships.
Jews did not serve in the army, but neither did the Muslims and
 Christians belonging to the sedentary local population. The Fatimid
 army consisted of Berbers, Turks, Negroes, and Bedouin levies; the
 Ayyubids, who were Kurds themselves, maintained a predominantly
 Kurdish and Turkoman officers corps with mercenaries drawn from







many different ethnic groups.10 We find Jewish physicians attached to
~he Egyptian army and navy. When we hear about Jewish army
purveyors less than we would expect, the cause might be that the
 various detachments provided themselves largely from the fiefs as-
 signed to them. As to government service, the share of the Jews was
 certainly higher than their percentage of the total population war-
 ranted. The whole administration and economy of the country were
 based on tax-farming, an activity in which the Jews, although to a
 lesser degree than the Christians, were prominent. Entrepreneurs, even
 with small capital (and often in partnership), paid the government a
 fixed sum for the revenue expected from the taxes on agriculture,
 industry, or business, or from a customs house or toll station, and the
 surplus of the money actually collected represented their profit. This
 activity brought Christians and Jews into contact with all layers of the
 population in practically every corner of the country. The Geniza
 seems even to reveal the curious fact that the strictly orthodox
 Ayyubids employed Jews to a larger extent than did the "liberal"
 sectarian Fatimids. In any event, Jews had opportunity to contact
 both the lower and the higher echelons of the government apparatus
 just as the rest of the population did,
 On the other hand, Jewish community life, it seems, differed
 markedly from that of the Muslim majority. The generally small
 Jewish communities, which provided almost all their social services
 themselves, were able to preserve more easily the ancient forms of
 intensive public life than the shapeless masses of Muslims, who had
 little opportunity for self-government. Whatever the origin of the
 Jewish communal organization might have been, whether it originated
 in the ancient Israelite primitive democracy, which had much in com-
 mon with pre-Islamic Arabian life, or whether it was created through
 the special needs of the synagogue, or whether it was formed or
 transformed by the influence of the Hellenistic and Roman system of
 semiautonomous local corporations, the picture emanating from the
 Geniza records so far has nothing comparable among the Muslims.
 This impression, however, may change in the light of future research in
 the development of Islamic urbanism.11
 The Jewish family, with its specific traditions and institutions, cer-
 tainly was distinctive in more than one respect. In many others, the
 Geniza portrays an establishment the like of which used to be found in
 many corners of the Mediterranean world: an extended family of
 strong cohesiveness, great reverence for the senior members, promi-
 nence in the house of the old lady who presides over a bevy of
 daughters, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren, tender care of broth-
 ers for sisters and vice versa, and in general a stronger emphasis on the
 ties of blood than on those created by marriage. When we find that the
 Geniza society was practically monogamous, although ancient Jewish
(like Muslim} law permitted polygamy, this practice was more charac-







 teristic of a progressive middle class than of a specific religious com-
 munity. It is not excluded that the same practice prevailed at that time
 in the corresponding layers of Muslim society. We shall get clarity in
 this point only if and when we shall have documents dealing with
 Muslims from this period similar in character and number to those
 provided to us by the Geniza.
Even more delicate is the question, how far the spirituality and
 psychology of the Geniza people were specifically Jewish and to what
 extent they could be taken as characteristic for the time and area in
 general. Finally, there remains the still far wider and more intricate
 problem, whether the various groups and individuals discernible in our
 records were representative of their countries of origin or domicile, of
 the world of Muslim civilization, or of Mediterranean, society as a
 whole. In the concluding chapter of this work, some clues for answers
 to this question will be provided. 12







CHAPTER II


 The Working People


 1. THE SOCIAL CLASSES
 The medieval society of northwestern Europe was predominantly
 agricultural and formed an imposing pyramid of highly differentiated
 and tightly closed ranks and classes: the kings and the great vassals;
 the higher and lower nobility; the higher and lower clerical orders;
 burghers and craftsmen, both organized in guilds of merchants or
 artisans; and, finally, the great mass of serfs, who worked the feudal
 manors.
 The Mediterranean Islamic society of the High Middle Ages was
 essentially urban. Serving kings, either in the administration or in the
 army, was a profession that was adopted or imposed, rather than a
 rank that conferred a special and permanent status. The divines within
 the orbit of Islamic civilization, irrespective of their denomination,
 were part and parcel of the middle class and were often engaged in
 economic activities. When the Muslim lawyers wanted to explain the
 nature of social inequality that invalidated a marriage between une-
 qual mates, they adduced examples from only two social layers: up-
 per-class businessmen (such as merchants trading in spices, textiles, or
 jewelry) or bankers, and lower-class manual laborers (such as weav-
 ers, bloodletters, tanners, or cobblers) .1 The government servants and
 the religious scholars did not form a well-defined social class, while the
 peasants did not belong to the society altogether. A marriage between a
 townsman and a peasant woman-let alone the opposite case--was not
 considered feasible. Fellahs and Bedouins alike were beyond the pale
 of civilization. They were lumped together as such under the term
 badw (Bedouins, or "outsiders") by the greatest observer of Muslim
 medieval society, Ibn Khaldun, although he, who viewed world history
 as a struggle for power between the wild peoples of the desert and the
 sedentary population, had every reason to include the peasants among
 the "insiders." Nothing is more indicative of the urban character of the
 civilization studied by him than his subsuming the fellahs under
 badw.2
 This does not mean that this society was rootless and cut off from







 the soil. Townspeople at that time were far less removed from the land
 than our own urban population normally is today. As the Geniza
 records indicate, not only the rich, but even people of modest means
 often possessed farming land and administered it personally. Many
 lived in little towns in the vicinity of their fields. Industries such as the
 production of oil, cheese, wine, and wax, were situated in the districts
 of olive growing, sheep breeding, viniculture, and bee keeping, respec-
 tively, and similarly, the great industrial crops such as flax, silk, and
 wool often were worked on the spot into raw material or even into
 finished products. Thus, the medieval townsman was, as a rule, never
 far away from nature and constantly involved in the primary processes
 of production. It is his voice, however, and only rarely that of the
 peasant who does the rough work, which we perceive in the Geniza
 records, or, for that matter, in any records that have come down to us
 from the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries.
The urban society consisted of many different layers. The gross
 division into an affluent bourgeoisie and the common people mostly
 doing manual work does not do justice to the many grades and shades
 in the texture of the society, which we are able to observe in the Geniza
 records. The tone of a letter, often even the formulation of a document,
 immediately indicates to which classes the persons concerned belonged
 and by how many rungs of the social ladder they were separated (when
 they were not members of the same group). Still, this differentiation,
 marked as it was, had very little in common with the watertight
 compartments dividing the contemporaneous world of feudalism, but
 was more akin to that prevailing in our own modern society, where the
 division into classes is a matter of fact and etiquette, not of laws and
 institutions.
It is also correct to say that the people mirrored in the Geniza
 records were definitely class conscious. Social inequality was the natu-
 ral thing to them, or, as they would put it, ordained by God. Its evils
 were mitigated by the common service of God, by joint action for the
 welfare of the community, by discreet help to needy members of one's
 own class and by boastful donations made during public appeals for
 the benefit of others. Open conflict between classes was not unknown in
 the Geniza world. It is in the nature of Klassenkampf for it to be most
 conspicuous in societies that have no institutionalized classes or where
 the castes begin to lose their rigidity.
At the top of the society was al-tabaqa al-'aliyya, the "uppermost
 story," or upper class.3 To it belonged high government officials and
agents, great doctors (often acting as parttime or fulltime court physi-
cians), chief judges, and leading businessmen, especially if they were
 learned enough to act also as community leaders. These were "the
 notables connected with the government and well known to it."' Such
 a person was normally given the Hebrew title siir, "prince," rendered







 in this book as "notable." It was a small group, where everyone knew
 his peer. Thus, we read in a letter, sent in 1130 by a Jewish notable from
 Granada, Spain, to a relative returning from Egypt who had just ar-
 rived in a Spanish port: "How did you find the upper class, small and
 hig [i.e., young and old, or, less or more important]-may God keep
 the honored position of all of you." 5 In a less formal sense the word is
 used in a document from the Egyptian town of Sunbat, dated Septem-
 ber 27, 1090, where it designates the people of higher station in general.6
 The Geniza has preserved less material about the private life of the
 members of this class than of that of the others, presumably because
 most of them lived in Cairo, the residence of the caliph, and not in
 Fustat (where the Geniza chamber was found) and probably also be-
 cause most of their correspondence was conducted in Arabic and not
 in Hebrew characters.
It would be fallacious to assume about the main body of the Geniza
 society that manual work as such was the chief characteristic of its
 lower strata. In reality the situation was far more complicated. It is
 true that the Hellenic contempt for anyone who worked with his hands
 had infected subsequent Mediterranean civilizations, including later
 Judaism and Islam. But the participation of the class of craftsmen in
 the development of these two religions was far too pronounced to leave
 that Greek prejudice unchallenged. Thus, in Judaism, along with the
 idea that manual work was degrading, we find the opposite conception,
 namely that toiling with one's hands assures bliss in this world and in
 the world to come. Exactly the same antagonism is to be met within
 the teachings of Islam. Correspondingly, the Geniza reveals that
 while the lowest ranks of society were formed by certain manual
 occupations, such as dyeing, we find people of the same crafts or of
 crafts known from other sources as despised, such as weaving, to be
 members of the middle middle, and sometimes even of the upper
 middle class. At least, as far as Jewish society is concerned, occupation
 alone did not determine one's social position.
What, then, were the factors that assigned man his place in society?
 First of all, his origin, his family. When he was of "the good people,"
 "the noble families," "the illustrious houses," he would not lose face,
even if personal misfortune deprived him of the material well-being
 normally enjoyed by respectable families. Thus, in a more indirect
way, wealth played a decisive role in the formation of the various
 ranks of society.7 Religiosity and learnedness-these two qualities were
interconnected in medieval Judaism, as in Islam-were other decisive
factors. At first sight, this appears strange to the modern observer. We
have to remember, however, that religious practice and theory enjoyed
a position in medieval life comparable to adherence to communism in
contemporary Russia or China. To be a fervent believer in, and gifted
expounder of, the ruling creed was a great title of honor and an







 indispensable qualification for public leadership. Besides its wealth, it
 was the number of pious and scholarly members adorning it, which
 determined the prestige of a family.
Integrity and sound business practices were other factors enhancing
 the social status of a family. Naturally, these are qualities held in
 esteem everywhere. They were particularly valued by a cosmopolitan
 society constantly on the move and facing many risks and incertitude.
 The warm words addressed to the three senior Tustari brothers of
 Fustat by their correspondents in Qayrawan, translated in Mediterra-
 nean People, are characteristic in this respect. 8
Last, but not least-or should we say, first-liberal spending, cou-
 pled with the readiness to exert oneself for the public welfare or for
 people seeking help, determined the social prestige of a person and of
 his clan. Generations after a man had died, his generosity toward the
 scholars and the needy still would be publicly eulogized during memo-
 rial services. 9 All the year round, appeals were made and contributions
 solicited, and, as stated above, page 12, lists enumerating the contribu-
 tors and sums donated by them have been preserved. Sometimes such
 lists are indicative of the economic stratification of the Geniza society.
 Thus the large fragment preserved in the Taylor-Schechter Collection,
 Cambridge, Box K 6, f. 149, represents the second and last leaves of
 such a list, which had been folded to form a booklet. The collection
 lasted for fourteen days, obviously because there was an emergency
 requiring a great expenditure, and community leaders had to go in
 person from one store or workshop to another to ask for contributions.
 Details for a part of the first day and for the entire second, thirteenth,
 and fourteenth are preserved. Clearly, some days were devoted to the
 richer and others to the poorer sections of the population. Thus, on the
 thirteenth day, almost all the contributions amounted to five or more
gold pieces, while most of those on the second were between one and
 one and a half or less. Persons engaged in manual work, such as dyeing,
glassmaking, or the manufacture of beads or women's scarves, paid
from one-half to one gold piece; some, whose profession is not indi-
cated, paid one-quarter (or its equivalent, ten silver pieces); storekeep-
ers, such as druggists, contributed an average of one-and-a-half, while
merchants and physicians gave sums ranging from three or four to five,
seven-and-a-half, and ten dinars, with one person, bearing the Hebrew
title "the generous," giving twenty (together with his uncle and his
brothers). It is significant that one physician paid only one dinar, the
same as various dyers, and one worker in silk contributed one-
and~a-half, the sum given by storekeepers, but also by one doctor.10
 It is characteristic for the position of slaves or freedmen that "the
boy" of a community leader paid five dinars, the average assessment of
the upper middle class. 1 The servants of the great often acted as chief
stewards and business agents of their masters and thus occupied de
facto a position similar to that of wealthy merchants.11







We see, then, that the Geniza speaks of five different social levels:
 the upper class; the bourgeoisie of businessmen and professionals,
 which itself was clearly divided into two layers, the upper middle and
 lower middle, to the lower of which also belonged the master artisans;
 the mass of urban craftsmen and laborers; and, finally, the peasants.
 The lower middle class were called "beggars." Thus, a Tunisian mer-
 chant writes to a young friend in Egypt around 1050: "Buy four bales
 of flax, but do not buy from the 'fansi'iwi (family name derived from
 that of an Egyptian village), for you have not enough strength to deal
 with these great houses, better pick out personally the best you can get
 from the beggars (the smaller merchants)." Similarly, a letter around
 1200, describing the catastrophic consequences of a heavy imposition
 by the government, concludes its complaint by saying: "The well-to-do
 are perishing together with the beggars," and another, written about a
 hundred and twenty years earlier, refers to the three lower grades of
 the society as follows: "These dinars are not good even for beggars and
 for craftsmen, only peasants would use them." The same expression is
 applied to a highly respected merchant with little means, in a letter
 from the beginning of the twelfth century.12
It remains for us to inquire whether these socioeconomic classes were
 tightly closed castes, a man being restricted to his station, or whether
 there existed opportunities for climbing the social ladder. The Geniza
 contains ample material on these questions, which conveys the impres-
 sion that the society mirrored in it was in this respect in a position
 halfway between the rigid system of feudalism and the mobility of a
 free modern society, but nearer to the latter.
A son normally followed the profession of his father; he was engaged
 in his father's business or workshop during the latter's lifetime, either
 as his employee or his partner, and would take over after his death.
 Similarly in the professions, we encounter families of doctors, of
 judges, and of lower community servants, such as cantors or scribes. A
 man would be called "the son of the clan of sieve-makers," "of
 indigo-dyers," "of scarf-makers" 13 or "the son of the judge," "the son
 of the doctor," and, as far as family names existed, about one-fourth of
 them (but no~ more, probably less) designated occupations.
As it was not always feasible, or perhaps even desirable, that all the
 sons, or even any sons, should do the same work as their father, we
 often find a man embracing an occupation of a type different from, but
 similar in social status, to that of his family. A Muslim silk-weaver,
 qazziiz, was the son of water carrier; the sons of a man keeping poultry
 became vendors of dried fruits; the son of a producer (and/or seller)
 of sal ammoniac, a worker in silk ~ariri, both common occupations;
 and the son of a scribe-a cantor. 14 A prominent physician's son and
 grandson acted as the merchants' representatives, a very honored posi-
 tion, while hia great-grandson would return to the medical profession.11
 When the name of a person is followed by two occupations, the first







 designates his family name, or the occupation of his father, and the
 second his own, and often little change in status is involved, as in the
 combination "the money-assayer, the money-changer." 16
Many occupational shifts are indicated in the Geniza, however,
 which definitely represented advancement in social status. Thus we
 read about a physician whose father was a tuna fish monger, or another
 whose father operated an oil press, cases reminiscent of a Muslim
 doctor, famous also as a writer, who was the son of a baker and so poor
 that he was unable to pay the apprentice's fees demanded by the
 doctors {wherefore he later propounded the theory that medicine is
 better learned from books than from teachers) .11 The name Mawwaz,
 "grower or vendor of bananas," was borne both by a receiver of one
 loaf of bread from the community and by the proprietor of a seagoing
 vessel carrying huge cargoes. 18 A mason was in receipt of four loaves,
 while a man called Mason donated a very considerable sum toward the
 building of a synagogue. 19 In many cases we find persons bearing
 names derived from manual occupations, such as spinner, potter, sad-
 dler, in the capacity of traders of high-priced goods, such as Oriental
 spices, or as shipowners, while the memorial lists show that some noble
 families have names indicating a very humble origin. 20 It is no exagger-
 ation to say that at least half the terms designating craftsmen dis-
 cussed in the subsequent sections appear in the Geniza documents as
 family names of persons belonging to the merchant or professional
 classes. In our own society such rise on the social ladder is common-
 place (although it is not as easy as people who read about it in the
 newspapers are perhaps inclined to believe); for the eleventh century it
 is noteworthy.
In brief I birth determined the status of a person in Mediterranean
 society to a certain extent, but by no means as much as it did in the
 contemporaneous feudal world. Natural gifts and good luck enabled a
 man to move up into a higher class. The classes themselves were
 differentiated not only by occupation and wealth, but by other, less
 tangible factors, such as religiosity, knowledge, integrity, and public
 service. Still, as occupation, together with ~he economic position nor-
 mally connected with it, was the main, although not the exclusive,
 divider of society, it is practicable to take it as the basis of our
 classification.


 2. THE CRAFTSMEN
Factories in the modern sense of the word, that is, plants where large
 numbers of wage earners are engaged in the production of great quanti-
 ties of one or of closely related commodities, rarely appear in the
 Geniza, just as big industry was unknown in ancient Rome.1 The
 normal form of production was that of a small workshop run by a







 single craftsman, a family, a clan, or by a number of partners, usually
 not more than five. In wholesale commerce large quantities of wares,
 often quoted in round numbers, were handled, but these, as far as we
 are able to perceive, were not delivered by one workshop, but hand-
 picked in a bazaar or ordered from various producers.
Only two industries seem to have been carried on, at least partly,
 in larger plants. The sugar matbakh's (literally: places of cooking)
 were real landmarks in the topography of the Egyptian capital, often
 referred to in the Geniza and diligently registered by the Muslim
 antiquarians. Sometimes, such a factory was worth well over a thou-
 sand dinars, while an ordinary workshop could be operated with a
 capital of less than ten. Thus we must assume that a sugar factory of
 the size of the one described in Appendix C, section 26, must have
 employed a great number of laborers. In Mamluk times, sugar became
 an importan~ monopoly of the sultans.
Another industrial product manufactured in matbakhs of impressive
 dimensions was paper. Abu Sa'id, a Maghrebi visitor to Egypt, remarks
 that the paper mills were confined to Fustat and not found in Cairo,
 the seat of the caliph. Egyptian paper was exported to Tunisia (example
 of an order: 5,000 sheets of fine paper and 1,000 of the 'fall].i type, see
 below) , as well as to Yemen and India. From the Geniza we learn also
 that Spanish paper was regarded as being of high quality, especially
 for the purpose of copying books, while very great quantities were im-
 ported to Egypt from Damascus, the latter brand being the one most
 in demand, particularly during the eleventh century. One letter speaks
 of 28 camel loads of paper bearing the 'aliima, or trademark, of one
 Ibn al-Imam of Damascus, for which the very high sum of 250 dinars
 was deposited as earnest money. At the same time, this trader sent to
 the very same Cairene firm twenty bales, shikiira, of Damascene
 paper, by sea via Tyre and, shortly afterward or before, another ten.
 From such details it might be inferred that paper, like sugar, was mass
 produced, at least by some industrialists. This would not be surprising.
 The manufacture of paper and sugar had no local tradition. These were
 industries that migrated from China and India, respectively, to Persia
 and thence to other Islamic countries. The Muslim historians tell us
 that paper originally was manufactured in large workshops belonging
 to governors and sultans. The 'fall:ti paper, which was made in Egypt
 during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, was named after 'fall}a b.
 Tahir, governor of Khorasan (d. 828), one of the early operators of a
 paper mill in Islam. It is natural that the system of mass production
 was continued when the bourgeoisie took over these lucrative industries
 from the ruling class. About the life of the laborers in such factories,
 however, we do not read a thing in the Geniza documents. They are
 concerned with the capitalists and managers of the larger plants and
 with the partners in smaller workshops. 2
Government establishments such as the caliphal mint were not or-







 ganized as industrial plants. Skilled laborers worked there on their
 own account, forming partnerships of different sizes and conditions
 amongst themselves. Appendix C, no. 15, serves as an example. A letter
 from an artisan in Damascus, who was the spiritual leader of the small
 Karaite community in that city, shows that, at least at that period
 (around 1040), skilled laborers could be forced to work in a govern-
 ment textile factory. A recruiting officer, mutawalli 'sti'miil, picked
 out the best craftsmen, and, once in, they could not get out for years
 except through a caliphal rescript to be secured from Cairo. S. M. Stern
 has rightly shown that a petition to the caliphal throne was the normal
 procedure for anyone seeking redress against highhanded actions of
 local officials. But the very fact that, in the case described, recourse
 had to be taken to this procedure shows that skilled laborers were
 pressed into the service of such government workshops much against
 their will. The writer bitterly complains that he was unable to partici-
 pate in the social and spiritual life of his brethren, but makes no allu-
 sion to low wages or want. No doubt, he was paid in the same way as the
 workers in the mint, namely, by the piece. 8 Other government establish-
 ments are occasionally mentioned in the Geniza. J alal al-Din ~a~ib
 diir al-tiraz, director of a government workshop for gala robes in
 Damietta, received a loan of 50 dinars from a Jewish bank for the
 duration of several years, and one wonders whether he needed it for
 the workshop (which is likely) or took it on his own account.4 Similarly,
 we find a "supervisor of the construction of government ships" sending
 cash (how much is not stated) to a banker, presumably refund of a
 loan.~ With the exception of the mint, where many Jews worked, we do
 not hear about the craftsmen in these establishments, mostly work-
 shops for the imperial wardrobes.
On the other hand, the Geniza is a rich source for the day-to-day life
 of the craftsmen in general, their economic and social position, and
 their ways of cooperation. Much has been written about Islamic
 guilds. 6 Of the mass of literature, I found particularly instructive the
 chapter on the Muslim and Jewish artisans of Fez before the French
 Protectorate (which was imposed on Morocco in 1912) by Roger Le
 Tourneau. In this chapter the technical and social aspects of an indig-
 enous industry are described with meticulous care and are judiciously
 checked against historical data. The artisans of Fez at that time were
 still organized in professional corporations, albeit of a somewhat looser
 texture than the medieval guilds of Christian Europe. The question is
 how far back in history does this phenomenon go. A recent study on the
 Byzantine guilds in the eleventh century takes it for granted that we
 know about Islamic guilds during that pedod more than we do with
 regard to the Byzantine. The opposite is the case. We look in vain for a
 term designating a guild in the Muslim handbooks of market supervi-
 sion which have come down to us from the twelfth century and which
 deal mainly with the crafts and trades. There was no such term







because guilds in the strict sense of the word had not yet come into
being. Members of one craft, even of different faiths, were connected
with each other in many ways, such as geographical concentration,
mutual financial help, and formal partnerships. But organized corpora-
tions of craftsmen of the type developed in Europe during the later
Middle Ages, or in Islam during the fourteenth through the nineteenth
centuries, are not attested in Arabic literature for the eleventh and
twelfth centuries. Only after the Turkish element had become prepon-
derant in Mediterranean Islam do we get reliable data on formally
organized professional corporations. This negative testimony is con-
firmed by the positive and detailed evidence of the Geniza documents
about the realities of the life of the craftsmen during that early period.
 Members of one craft normally were concentrated in one locality. As
far as the Geniza is concerned, this may be concluded from the many
names of bazaars, streets, lanes, squares, and compounds (dar, often
translated as "house") named after one or another group, such as
clothiers, tailors, perfumers, coppersmiths, turners, chestmakers, wool-
workers, manufacturers of leather bottles, makers of almond sweet-
meats, oil-makers, and so on, or bearing the names of products such as
silk, cotton, or milk, or of occupations such as spinning. Many of these
names of localities in Fustat are known to us also from the excellent
works of Muslim geographers and antiquarians, others are not. 7 For
other Islamic cities, such as Damascus, we possess similar data. It is,
however, doubtful, whether at the time of our records most of these
localities were actually occupied exclusively by the crafts after which
they were called. Clearly, there was no coercion in this respect. Thus, a
document from fall, 1125, deals with a partnership for the manufacture
of glass in a store that one party possessed in the "Street of the
Coppersmiths" of Old Cairo and which had been used formerly for the
selling of copper vessels. Another deed of partnership, dated 1104,
refers to a grocery store "at the Gate of the Turners." A seller of
potions had his shop on the "Bazaar of the Blacksmiths," a money-
changer's address was the "Street of the Coppersmiths," and the
"Street of the Alchemists" was the seat of authorized money-assayers. 8
Most deeds referring to these localities deal with private homes situ-
ated in them owned by persons such as physicians or judges, who were
in no way connected with the crafts after which those localities were
called. The very fact that a twelfth-century Spanish handbook for
market supervision strongly recommends that each occupation should
be assigned a separate place seems to show that in practice much
freedom prevailed in this matter in those times. 9
 Another indication of the geographical concentration of the various
crafts is found in the Geniza lists of contributors, which are sometimes
arranged, at least partly, according to the "business addresses,"
namely the bazaars where persons following the same profession had
their shops, or where craftsmen working in adjacent fields, such as







 melting silver or gold and polishing the completed coins, are listed as
 having been solicited at the same time. Even porters were stationed in
 groups, an arrangement that can still be observed in Middle East cities
 today.10 On the other hand, we find mentioned together in one and the
 same list, alongside with groups of dyers or perfumers, individuals of
 different professions.11 This also seems to point to the fact that the
 system of assigning a special locality to each profession cannot have
 been too rigid.
Artisans exercising the same craft in a town sometimes appear as a
 group or as a firm. "I lost much money through the painters [who did
 not pay for the dyes]"; and: "What the painters owe us can never be
 retrieved," writes a merchant from Qayrawan (early eleventh century).
 "The silk-workers are in trouble; they have not paid a thing; I shall
 sue them," we read in a letter from Alexandria (second half of eleventh
 century). Another letter from the same city and period refers to a
 somewhat different situation: "Do not worry about the silk-workers.
 With God's help I shall collect from them to your satisfaction all due
 to you from them." With reference to the same group a third merchant
 reports to his father: "I have collected the money due from the silk-
 workers." Such groups existed also in smaller towns. The Nagid
 Mevorakh writes to the notable Abraham b. Nathan, whom he ad-
 dresses as "The Favorite of the Community," a title indicative of the
 influential position he occupied throughout the Jewish communities of
 Egypt: "You wrote to me in your last letter about the situation of our
 coreligionists, the glassmakers in the [city ofJ Fayyiim. . . . I asked
 you, and I am asking you again, to mediate between them." An account
 from Sunbat in Lower Egypt from July, 1150, notes "a debt to the
 community on the sjdc of the dyers of Dams1s." These references should
 be understood in the light of the query sub:nitted to Maimonides with
 regard to the silk-workers of Fustat and al-Mal)alla, discussed below,
 page 88. Such persons, when appearing as a firm, were partners con-
 ducting one or several workshops, eager to remain the sole producer in
 the field, but sometimes, as in the case of al-Fayyiim, were at logger-
 heads with each other.12
The 'arif, or head of a profession-as far as such an office existed-
 was not a leader elected by the members of his group, but a supervisor
 appointed by the market police in order to assist it in its fight against
 fraudulent practices. 18 The Geniza makes mention of this office rarely
 and only with reference to banking. It is perhaps noteworthy that the
 son and other members of the family of an 'arif in Qii'1, Upper Egypt,
 served as persons of trust to the Jewish chief justice in Old Cairo.1'
The Islamic guilds of the later Middle Ages, just as their Christian
 counterparts in Europe, had a semireligious character. The Jewish
 corporations that sprang up on Islamic soil, such as those of the
 goldsmiths and embroiderers of Fez, or the kaikji's, or boatmen of
 Istanbul (seventeenth through nineteenth centuries), were similarly







confined to one religious community and fulfilled specific social and
religious in addition to their general professional tasks.15 No such
exclusiveness is to be observed in the Geniza papers.
 We hear of Muslim and Jewish silversmiths and glassworkers who
run shops in partnership, each group taking off its own weekly holiday;
of Muslim carpenters working partly as employees and partly as
partners of a Jewish fellow carpenter, and even of a Jewish court
inviting Gentile experts in purple-dyeing together with· their Jewish
colleagues to estimate the value of the equipment of a workshop
forming part of the inheritance of an orphan girl.16 Loans granted by a
Muslim to a Jewish craftsman and vice versa are described on page
254, below.
 The protection of the vested interests of the local artisans against
the intrusion of foreigners-an important task of the later guilds-was
entrusted in the period under discussion to the community at large.
Several letters have been preserved in which grievances against compe-
tition by newcomers from Palestine and Lebanon were submitted to
the Nagid of Egypt. Conversely, we have a moving letter from a group
of artisans complaining that "the Jews," that is, the local community,
did not permit them to practice their craft under penalty of excommu-
nication. The fact mentioned on page 56, above, that foreigners com-
posed the largest single group of receivers of alms from the public chest
seems to indicate that it was not easy for nonresidents to find work. A
man from Alexandria who had fled to Fustat with his little son because
he was unable to pay the poll tax writes that he did not find anyone
who was prepared to employ him, even for 1 dirhem a day. Most of the
foreigners whose occupation is indicated in the lists of persons as
having recourse to public charity were craftsmen.1'
 The manufacture and the sale of goods were as little separated in
this period as they were in ancient Rome.18 Thus, at the conclusion of a
partnership, two silversmiths undertake to share their profits "obtained
by work and sales." Another partnership is made for "tailoring and the
sale of textiles." At the dissolution of a partnership between two
weavers the relevant document states that, in future, no party would
have any right to the earnings of the other "by trading or by weav-
ing." 19 A "perfumer" normally sold perfumes, drugs, and spices, but
would also produce rosewater in large quantities. 20 We find a bleacher
as well as an embroiderer selling robes.21 Therefore, the name of the
occupation embraced by a person often is not sufficient to indicate
whether he was mainly an artisan or a businessman. Thus, naf/af (from
naft, the same word as English naphtha) could designate a man proc-
essing petroleum, or one who sold it (or perhaps even a soldier who
specialized in flame-throwing) .22
 The equipment of workshops is frequently referred to in legal deeds,
which is natural, for "an artisan without tools is nothing," as a Hebrew
medieval proverb has it. 21 Unfortunately, however, these references are







mostly of a general nature, as when a silk-weaver leaves all the
implements of his workshop to one of his four sons. The equipment for
purple dyeing referred to above, page 85, was valued at 50 dinars, a
 very high sum. An inventory of the workshop of a silk-weaver, dated
1157, contained thirty-two items, but most of them are either effaced or
partly torn away. He possessed four looms, three combs for silk-
weaving, three cylinders of wood on which the woven materials were
rolled, two irons, one for the pressing of robes and another for the
pressing of fabrics worn as turbans, wickerwork baskets full of wal'ps,
various quantities of bleached and other linen (which was woven
together with silk), a small pot with weaver's reeds, copper threads
covered with silver, and other items not preserved. The instruments
taken away from a silk-weaver in Dahshiir (the village famous for its
pyramids) counted twenty-six items, of which nine were different from
those just mentioned. A charge against a carpenter of having his
Muslim employees work on Saturdays gives an opportunity to describe
such a workshop in operation.2•
 Peregrinating craftsmen are less frequently met with in the Geniza
papers than one would expect. A woman writing from al-Mahdiyya
describes the dire lot of her daughter whose husband, a dyer, "was one
month in the village and six away." 21> Dyers from Old Cairo who
traveled to Damietta for exercising their craft there and others who
tried to do the same in Upper Egypt have left us documents (see App.
C, nos. 12 and 20).
 With the exception of foreigners and disabled persons, craftsmen
seem not to have suffered by the curse of unemployment. Among the
hundreds of requests for help preserved in the Geniza, so far not a
single one has been found in which a local artisan would adduce as
reason for his plight the fact that he was out of work. On the contrary,
it seems that it was not always easy to get a craftsman, at least a
satisfactory one. In a letter from the environment of B~ir four em-
ployers, engaged in the scutching of flax and the "beating" of hemp,
compete for the services of the laborers available and partly snatch
them away from each other. For the repair of a building carried out
in summer, 1045, at least seven different masons succeeding each other
were employed on twenty-four working days. 20 When a notable in Cairo
wanted some mats, his representative in Alexandria (which was re-
nowned for ·this industry) requested the Dayya.n, or Jewish judge, to
talk to a mat-maker, and after the latter had consented to do the job,
the representative reported back to Cairo.27 That artisans did not
deliver the goods ordered in time was of course not peculiar to the
period di'scussed. A book on market supervision notes this deficiency
and fixes one week as the maximum delay allowed. 28 An exceptionally
angry Geniza letter complains that the artisan, instead of returning
the finished product, began to haggle about the price.211 The compara-







tively high cost of skilled labor, discussed on page 94, below, is indic-
ative of its scarceness.
 The normal form of industrial cooperation, as reflected in the Ge-
niza, was partnership, not employment. Even a craftsman with small
means, or none, would not, as a rule, become a laborer and wage earner,
but would conclude a partnership with one or more fellow craftsmen or
with an outsider who would provide him with capital. The general and
legal aspects of this most vital institution are treated on pages 169 ff.,
below. Here the main traits of industrial partnership are discussed.
 Besides occasional references in letters, this discussion is based on
twenty-seven documents, described in Appendix C.30 They range in
date between 1016 and 1240, with one, undated, being even later, in the
amount of sums invested between 4 dinars (no. 7) and 1,510 dinars
 (no. 10), and in the duration of the contract between six and a half
months (no. 9) to next to a lifetime (nos. 4 and 18). The industries
concerned are gold- and silversmithing and other metal work (nos. 2, 4,
14, 15, 17, 21), dyeing (purple; nos. 1, 12; indigo; 18, 20; silk; 22), the
manufacture of glass vessels (nos. 8, 9, 17, 19), weaving (nos. 3, 5, 13),
silkwork (nos. 16, 22), tailoring (no. 6), tanning (no. 24), bread-
Laking (no. 7), the making of wine (no. 10) and cheese (no. 27), sugar
factories (nos. 23, 25, 26), and a pharmacy (no. 11).
 It is indicative of the 11 freedom of contract" that characterizes this
period that the conditions of partnership varied widely from one docu-
ment to another. The normal procedure for the cooperation between
craftsmen consisted in capital and work put into the partnership in
equal shares (nos. 4, 7, 22, five partners), the equipment and tools also
being common property (stated only when required by special circum-
stances, as in no. 17). Profits and losses would be shared in the same
proportion, and often a daily remuneration would be taken out of the
"purse of the partnership." (Weekly payments out of the common
stock have been found so far only in commercial contracts [see below,
p. 175 J.) This remuneration would consist either in cash, for example,
 1-½ dirhems per day (no. 11), or in lunch and supper for the partners,
but not their families (no. 20), or would be left to the discretion of the
partners, on condition that it should be the same for all (no. 9 and
often). Sometimes, one partner "\\'.as unable to pay his contribution in
full at the writing of a contract and promised to do so at a later date
 (nos. 11, 21, 27). Only two documents (nos. 3, 10) state expressly that,
for the duration of the contract, the working, or executive, member was
not allowed to conclude another partnership. This lies, however, in the
nature of industrial cooperation.31
 In many cases-and these are particularly interesting-the contri-
butions of the partners differed with regard to the capital invested, the
equipment acquired or brought into the partnership, and the work to be
done by the different members. Thus (in no. 9), one glassmaker paid in







 20 dinars, while his partner did not contribute any capital, but received
 a personal loan of 10 dinars, on condition that the partner contributing
 the money would work only two "turns" a week, an<l he the rest. In
 another contract between two glassmakers, one paid in 199 dinars and
 the other only 6, contributing also a sma11 quantity of raw material
(no. 19). In a lawsuit involving three tanners in a small town of Lower
 Egypt, which had already been considered by Muslim courts three
 times and once had even reached the court of Abraham Maimonides,
 one was clearly the main provider of the capital, while the two others
 were unable to meet their obligations (no. 24). In another partnership
 of three (no. 4) 1 the raw materials and most of the assets belonged to
 all members in equal shares, while of one particular debt, one-half was
payable to one and two-quarters to the other two. In a fifth case, one
partner provided the capital, but the other who provided the equip-
ment as well as the running costs enjoyed some special privileges (no.
 11).
We also hear about a "trust," a combination of two partnerships in
two different cities. A successful silk cooperative in al-Mal}alla in
Lower Egypt opened a store in Fustat in the neighborhood of another
such corporation, lowering the prices. The latter, fearing that they
would be unable to compete with the newcomers, combined with them
in such a way that one of the partners from al-Mal)alla moved to
Fustat and entered the workshop there and vice versa, while it was
agreed that in each city there should be only one such workshop and
that their capitals should not be merged. Maimonides was asked
whether such an agreement was legal-he answered in the affirmative
 (no. 16). The very fact that such a question was raised seems to indi-
cate that despite the freedom of contract people were anxious not to
conflict with the law.
The short duration of some of these contracts (six and a half months
 [no. 9]; one year [nos. 2 1 11, 19, 20]) is paralleled by similar condi-
tions appearing in commercial partnerships. While short-term con-
nections are natural in business relations, however, they seem to be
somewhat impracticable for running a workshop. As the Geniza has
preserved contracts for the continuation c:>f partnerships, we may as-
sume that the short terms stipulated in the original agreements were
regarded as periods of trial.
Partnerships between craftsmen and persons supplying the money
betray the same wide variety as those between craftsrnen themselves.
There could be one or more participants on both sides (one on each side
[no. 5]; two investors, one worker [no. 2]; one investor and a number
of artisans [no. 20]). The terms sometimes .seem comparatively hard to
us, as when one craftsman is obliged to return in cash the whole sum
supplied (50 dinars out of a total of 65 invested) only two months after
he would be notified to do so by his partner (no. 5). Sometimes they
are exceptionally generous, as when a group of indigo dyers received







two-thirds of the profit (as laid down by Jewish law, cf. p. 176, below),
but was not held responsible for losses endured through government
requisitions, sinking of goods while in transport on the Nile, and other
acts of God, and were even exempted up to 10 dinars from losses
resulting from the operation of the workshop (no. 20). In the same
contract, the dyers undertake to work "with their own bodies," that is,
not to employ others. It is evident that the investor's personal confi-
dence in the skilJ and devotion of his partners inspired the terms. A
similar personal touch, but in a different vein, is to be found in number
2, where the artisan, a man from Tyre, Lebanon, promises to pay the
heavy penalty of 20 gold pieces in case "he speaks about travel or
longing to see his children and wife [in this order].i'
 It was quite exceptional that in a contract of partnership in a
workshop neither party was engaged in the industry concerned. In one
document, two physicians, father and son, admitted a scholar as part-
ner in a "sugar factory" belonging to them, a total share of 100 dinars
being brought in by him (no. 23). Since this was a comparatively small
undertaking, it is not impossible that the two doctors actually looked
after their sugar shop. In another contract, two brothers who had
partly inherited from their father and partly bought from their other
brothers a sugar factory accepted 400 dinars from one prominent
personality and 200 from another with a view to forming a partnership
with them in which the investors and the managers would have an
equal share. Thus, the whole plant must have been valued at that time
at around 1,200 dinars, an assumption confirmed by another document
referring to the same building.82 Although the two brothers were Leb-
dis, scions of an ancient family of India traders, they obviously
attended to their sugar factory in person (no. 26). In the fragmentary
document number 25, only two notables are involved in the joint
proprietorship of a (sugar) workshop, with no worker or manager
participating.
 Lifelong partnerships developed into relationships similar to, or even
stronger than family ties. Thus, a dyer, setting out for the holy pil-
grimage to Jerusalem, made provisions for his wife and children in the
event that something happened to him, but appointed his partner as
sole executor, trustee, and guardian. The workshop was valued at 150
dinars, not a small sum for the type of craft concerned (no. 18). Even
more telling is the case where a testator did not appoint his brother,
who also was his partner, but another partner as executor of his will,
freeing him of any obligation to give an oath or to otherwise account
for his dealings (no. 4).
 We can form some idea of the earnings of craftsmen by comparison
with the wages paid skilled laborers. According to the documents
analyzed on pages 94 ff., below, a master artisan earned an average of
six dirhems per day during the eleventh arid twelfth centuries, while
unskilled workers received between two and two and a half. It is also







 significant that the majority of the lists of contributors to public
 appeals do not show a wide scale of social (or economic) differentia-
 tion, as does the list discussed above, page 78, but mostly list sums
 between a quarter and one or two dinars (or dirhems, as the case might
 have been), and the craftsmen were by no means always in the lower
 categories.33
Payments for work done or ordered are mentioned occasionally in
 Geniza letters, but much more material will have to be collected and
 coordinated with data on the cost of living in general before any valid
 conclusions can be drawn from them. As a rule, the craftsman did not
 provide the material, such as threads, fabrics, or metals. These were
 given to him by the proprietor and were weighed before and after the
 manufacture of the object ordered. "I do silkwork for 10 dirhems per
 pound," writes a man sojourning in Fustat to his mother, no doubt a
 weaver, since the quantity required from a dyer for that payment was
 at least thirty times as much (seep. 107, below). Around 1120, another
 silk-weaver in Old Cairo received 9-½ dirhems for weaving a piece of
 cloth 19-½ cubits long, that is, ½ dirhem per cubit.u Fifty years ear-
 lier, in Alexandria, a weaver of linen was paid 5 qirat,s of gold for 25 cu-
 a
 bits, 1 qirat (worth then little over 1-½ silver dirhems) for 5 cubits,
 which makes approximately 0.3 dirhems per cubit. The blanching and
 glossing of the same material in its entirety cost 3-½ qirats. A few lines
 later, the same letter reports that the weaving of two maqta' cloths and
 a neckpiece, radda, cost 14 qirats, and their bleaching and glossing, 6-½
 qirat.,s. 85 About the making of a linen millJ,afa (which served both as a
 cloak and a bedcover) we read in a letter from the same city and ap-
 proximately the same time: '~I agreed 311 with its maker upon 22 qirats.
 Later on, I extracted from him a discount of 2 qirat,s and then 2-½
 dirhems were deducted, namely, 1-½ dirhems which I had paid for the
 unravelling of the thread and 1 dirhem for silk. Thus, the whole price
 paid for it amounted to 37-½ dirhems." From another section of the
 letter it is evident that haggling about the price of a piece of silk manu-
 factured by a craftsman was common even after its completion.17 When
 a craftsman did not succeed in finishing an object ordered with the
 material provided to him, the dispute could reach "the government,"
 that is, the market police. (Again a mill)afa, ordered in Alexandria by
 a merchant living in Fustat, this time one made of cotton.) 88
For making a piece of jewelry out of 31 mithqa1s (later in the same
 letter referred to as dinars) of base gold, a remuneration of 100
 dirhems was paid to a goldsmith around 1190.119 The Geniza contains
 hundreds of details concerning the prices of ornaments, but very little
 about the payment received by the craftsmen who created them.
Masons, carpenters, and sawyers, it seems, mostly worked on a day-
 to-day basis (see below). Naturally, there were also smaller repairs
 and orders for which special agreements had to be made. The smallest
 remuneration attested so far for a carpenter was% dirhem.'° A repair







on doors and a staircase brought 1 dirhem to a carpenter at a time
when ¾ dirhem had to be paid for nails needed for the same opera-
tion.41 Specialists in the building of cesspools got 4 dirhems for making
a drainpipe in a house belonging to the public chest.42 For making (or
repairing) the street entrance on another house of the same type, a
mason was paid 3-½ dirhems.43 For the remuneration of persons en-
gaged in transport and in the mail service, compare chapter iv, sections
3 and 11.
 Melakha-meliikhii, "A craft is a kingdom." 44 In the light of our
records, this medieval Hebrew pun (which is referred to in a Geniza
letter) seems to be fully justified. It is true, craftsmen belonged to the
lower strata of the society. But a skilled and successful artisan was a
respected person who was addressed as "elder" (Ar. shaykh, Heb.
ziiqen), just as was a merchant.'5 Manual work as such was not
regarded as degrading. A Qayrawanese trader known to us from a
number of letters as a widely traveled businessman did not believe it
beneath his dignity to work parttime in tailoring when business in
Egypt was at a standstill.48 From many a Geniza letter we learn that a
piece of clothing or household equipment was ordered from a craftsman
mentioned by name living in another town, or was even sent to him for
repair. Thus, by his skill and reliability he would acquire renown, and,
we may assume, also a modest degree of prosperity and social accept-
ance.
 The generally good standing of the craftsman in the Jewish society
of the Geniza period had as corollary that we hear very little about
despised professions, a subject conspicuous in postbiblical Hebrew
literature and discussed at length by the lawyers of Islam. According
to them, a member of s1:1ch a profession was not qualified to marry a
girl from a good family and could even be denied the right to appear as
a witness in court.47 Some of the occupations ostracized by Muslim
lawyers, such as those of cleaners of sewers and cesspools, streetsweep-
ers and bathhouse attendants, never appear in the Geniza as per-
formed by Jews. Had the community of Fustat comprised such per-
sons, some of them must have been mentioned in the many lists of
indigent persons doing service jobs and assisted by the communal
chest. The work of the cupper, or bloodletter which also was subject to
disqualification according to the Muslim lawyers, was not despised
because it was somehow a subsection of the highly honored medical
profession. Prospective physicians tried to acquire chirurgical skill by
the practice of bleeding!8 We find a cupper contributing to a public
appeal and addressed as "elder," another mentioned as an ancestor in a
memorial list, and a third as receiver of a calligraphic letter dealing
with a matter of inheritance, attended to by the Nagid.'9 In the contest
between the rank and file of the community and the ruling oligarchy,
members of the latter sometimes characterized their opponents as
performing certain manual occupations of low esteem, such as those of







 oyster-gatherers, dyers, and cobblers in Alexandria and potters in
 Fustat.50 Such outbursts, however, are rare, and with the exception of
 the oystermen of Alexandria, who are mentioned elsewhere in a deroga-
 tory context, it was not the occupation as such, but the economic and
 social status reached which counted. The Geniza provides a good
 number of examples of affluent and respectable dyers.
In a few cases, we read that an artisan bore a title indicating that he
 was a scholarly man. "Make these threads into a cloth," says a letter,
 "and send it for me to the l}aver to bleach and tailor it before the holi-
 days." 51 The title I,ii.ver, or fellow of the academy, was given in those
 days only to persons who qualified as scholars. Another \}aver was an
 'affdr, that is, he operated an oil- or wine-press (his wife took a loan of
 50 dinars as a mortgage on her house, certainly for him) , a third one
 made pancakes-and in Constantinople, of all places.52 There was
 nothing exceptional in a learned person being engaged in bleaching and
 tailoring or other manual work, for in this period we even find a Gaon
 at the head of the Jewish academy in Baghdad who had formerly been
 a weaver, a profession ranked as despised both in the Talmud and in
 Islamic literature.51 Still, scholarship was not as common among the
 artisans we read about in the Geniza letters as it was in Palestine in
 the early centuries of the Christian era, or in the Jewish communities
 of Yemen as described by travelers in modem times. Not only were
 Yemenite weavers and silversmiths, that is, persons engaged in crafts
 requiring only a limited physical effort, known as scholars and authors
 of books, but even a Jewish blacksmith in Yemen who forged plough-
 shares and other agricultural implements all the day long, was described
 by a most competent observer as being learned in all religious subjects,
 including the esoteric doctrines, "like any of the great rabbis in Po-
 land."" One of my own informants in the 1930's, a blacksmith from
 f;!an'a, who had even made nails with his own hands (he was a beauty
 of a man) put me to shame by his knowledge of cabbala and ritual
 law.55 During the Geniza period, the situation was different. Learning
 was mainly the domain of the mercantile middle class. It was the
 heyday of the bourgeoisie.


 3. THE WAGE EARNERS
 "I eat bread in the service of others; every minute of the day I gulp
 the cup of death because of my degradation and that of my children."
 These are the words of a Tunisian merchant who lost everything he
 possessed in shipwreck and was forced to enter the service of others
 after his arrival in Egypt.1 A similar tone is sounded by Maimonides in
 a famous letter to one of his former disciples, in which he advises him
 not; to accept an appointment by the Jewish Exilarcb of Baghdad, but
 to earn his livelihood by commerce and teaching medicine and to teach







religious subjects without remuneration: "One dirhem earned on hire
with a tailor, a carpenter, or a weaver is preferable to such an appoint-
ment." As we see, it is not so much the type of work done as the state
of dependence on others which was deemed so humiliating. An intrinsi-
cally medieval society, such as that of the Jews of Yemen, almost all of
whom had been artisans, but almost none employees, has preserved a
similar attitude down to the middle of the twentieth century. The
origin of this prejudice is perhaps to be sought in the similarity of
service to slavery. 2
The lamented Leon Arye Mayer, who devoted half a lifetime to the
study of the craftsmen in classical Islamic civilization, defined the
three grades of employees as follows: tilmidh, pupil, ghuliim, appren-
tice, and ajir, journeyman.3 The nomenclature in the Geniza records is
somewhat different. The words ghulam, which means "young man,"
and ~abi, "boy," are generally used for a person in service of another,
whether as a free person or as a slave, in industry or in commerce. The
 idea behind this designation is that one served as employee only while
young and in order to learn a craft, or profession, or to make oneself
 acquainted with local conditions. The words were used for persons long
 past the stage of apprenticeship, as when considerable sums of money
 were sent from one town to another with "Mr. Abu '1-Bishr Salman,
 the young man of Ibn Saghir," 4 or when two important powers of
 attorney were entrusted to "Isaac b. Barhiin, 'the boy' of Judah" travel-
 ing from Egypt to Tunisia. 5 In a list of contributors, a notable donates
 five quarters of a dinar, while his "boy," a Kohen, pledges one quarter,
 the "boy" of another also gives one quarter, but his employer only a
 quarter and a half. 8 A list of partial payments for the poll tax includes
 fl ve persons called "young men" of so-and-so and three called "boys,"
 but as far as the amount of the sums indicates, there was no difference
 between the two terms.7 Minor government official& were also called
 "young men" or "boys." 8
 In order to describe a person more precisely as an employee, as dif-
 ferent from a slave, he was called ajir, literally "hireling," a term in
 use in legal parlance rather than in ordinary speech. A journeyman
 would be designated with the general term ~ani', which means both
 laborer and craftsman. The word would be used of a person working
 in a glass factory or a silk-weaving shop, but also for one in service of
 a "bride-comber," a woman who dressed up brides and took care of
 other arrangements for weddings.' In a brawl, a man would avail him-
 self of the help of his son, his nephew, and his journeyman.10 Persons
 engaged in the highly specialized craft of perforating pearls are de-
 scribed in an account as 'ammalin, workmen, used in the same docu-
 ment as synonymous with ~ani 1•11 The difference between the aj'ir and
 i,ani', "hireling" and "laborer," on the one hand, and the ghulam and
 ~abi, "young man" and "boy," on the other, seems to have consisted not
 so much in the degree of perfection in the craft or occupation concerned,







 but the former designated more transient and businesslike relations with
 an employer and the latter more permanent and personal ones. It is
 therefore not surprising to read in a will that the testator left the not
 inconsiderable sum of ten gold pieces to the "boy" working with himself
 and his brother. 12
Laborers engaged in work requiring less skill were designated by
 names indicating the type of help they normally provided. The most
 common was raqqa:j, "runner," or "errand boy," which originally
 designated the laborer who carried the materials up to the mason work-
 ing on the scaffolding, but was also used for other craftsmen's helpers,
 such as carpenters, and very frequently, for irregular policemen. A
 helper in a workshop was called muniiwil, literally one who passes along
 or hands on, or simply ~abi, "boy." 18
Domestic work was normally done by female slaves. Therefore, we
 very rarely hear about "servants." 14 The word khiidim, "servant," so
 frequent in the Geniza, designates the beadle of a synagogue, or a
 public servant in general. Sometimes it refers to the slave of a caliph,
 who often had an influential position.
The wages and conditions of employment were normally not put
 down in writing, wherefore we have mostly only indirect references to
 them. By chance, fragments of both the draft and final copy of one
 contract of employment, written in Old Cairo in the spring of 1057,
 have been preserved, so that we are in a position to know its full
 contents. This was an agreement between two partners and a laborer,
 ~ani', all three being indiscriminately termed zajjaj, glassmakers. ( A
 third fragment, from 1030, approximately, refers to "wages for the
 molding of glass.") The laborer undertook to work on the melting
 furnace for the duration of a year, consisting of twelve lunar months 1 ~
 and promised to do so "in truth and faithfulness." His remuneration
 would consist in 5 dirhems and lunch worth 1 dirhem on any day he
 worked. He would not work for anyone else during the period of the
 contract. In case he violated this undertaking, he would have to pay 5
 dinars to the public chest (of the two synagogues in Old Cairo). As the
 contract has the form of an undertaking by the laborer ("I have hired
 myself out to . . ."), it does not state what penalty was incumbent on
 the employers, in case they did not adhere to the conditions of the
 contract. Since the wages were paid at the termination of each working
 day (see below), and since, as the condition not to work for others
 shows, workmen were more difficult to get at that time than employ-
 ment, no difficulties from employers were envisaged.16
Simultaneously with the writing of this volume, Professor E. Ashtor
 is working on a book on wages and prices in medieval Islam in which
 he intends to make much use of Geniza material. For this reason, and
 also because I turn again to these qi.:estions while discussing the
 general standard of Jiving of the Geniza people (Vol. III, chap. viii), I
 confine myself here to a few telling examples. Many more are included







in Appendix A to my study "The Social Services of the Jewish Commu-
nity ..." (cf. Abbreviations and Symbols).
The amazing stability of prices and wages in our period, to which
Ashtor has drawn attention in his paper, "Quelques indications sur les
revenus dans l'orient musulman au haut moyen age" 17 is well reflected
in the Geniza records. In a statement about expenses on repairs of a
public building from the year 1199, a hundred and forty-two years
after the contract of the three glassmakers just discussed, the daily
wage of the laborer (a mason) is still 5 dirhems, and, in addition, he
gets a lunch worth I-¼ dirhems. The helpers receive 2-¼, the water
carrier 1-½, and the overseer 2 dirhems (1 for half a day's work).18 In
an undated, similar statement, the mason again receives 5, the helpers,
presumably, three, 6-½ on each day, the water carrier, 2-½ (depend-
ing obviously on the quantity of water supplied), and the overseer, 2
dirhems. 19 In an account dated 1183, on one day the laborer, called by
name, together with his two helpers, received 10 dirhems, on the fol-
 lowing day, he, together with his "boy," got 7, and the helpers, 5
 dirhems. Thus, his own wage most probably was again 5, that of a
 helper 2-½, and of a "boy" 2 dirhems. His lunch cost 1-¼ dirhems.
The overseer was paid I-½ dirhems for each day. 2 °From a fragmentary
 document whose date has not been preserved, where a mason, a carpen-
 ter, and their helpers are enumerated, we learn expressly that only the
 masters were given lunch worth ¾ dirhem for each, while the helpers
 received a daily wage of 2 dirhems. Only the carpenter's wage, which
 was 4 dirhems, is preserved. Similarly, a large account from Abu Sir
(Bii1?ir), written around 1045, describes the packing of eight bales,
 which required two days and cost, besides the materials, which are
 listed separately, about 33 dirhems. In addition, the packers were
 given lunch, which cost 3 dirhems. Clearly, three packers were engaged,
 each receiving 5-½ dirhems per day, while the lunch cost ½ dirhem
 per person, again a total emolument of 6 dirhems for a skilled worker. 21
The same consistency can be observed with regard to the payment of
 the overseer, whose task was to supervise the work and to register the
 expenses. This "white-collar" job brought between I-½-2 dirhems, less
 than the lowest manual work. An autograph note by Moses Maimon-
 ides, who then was Head of the Jewish community of Egypt, author-
 izes an official to draw a daily stipend of 2 dirhems· for the supervision
 of work on a public building-a confirmation of the conclusion drawn
 from the examples cited above that this was the standard remuneration
 for such a service.22 In one elaborate, but unsigned (which probably
 means not approved), agreement such an overseer is said to have
 delegated his task to another for half a dirhem per day. 23
Of particular interest is an extensive and detailed, though fragmen-
 tary, account regarding building operations carried out in the year
 1040 in the synagogue of the Palestinians and in buildings belonging to
 it. For twenty-eight days of work, specified in the account, the master







mason received a lump sum of 2-¾ dinars, which sum corresponded at
that time approximaLely to 110 dirhems. Thus, his remuneration was
 about 4 dirhems per day. In addition, he was given a lunch worth 3/4
dirhem every day he worked. Each of his helpers received 2-¾ dirhems
per day, but no lunch. A carpenter and his "boy" were remunerated
with 6-½ dirhems, and the man who did the plastering of the interior
with 4 dirhems. The fact that the mason was given lunch, although a
gross sum had been stipulated for the whole work, shows that ancient
custom was here in operation. 24
 Finally, an account written in or around 1183 deserves mention
because it specifies the wages of many different workmen engaged in a
building operation during nine consecutive days (with the exception of
 the Sabbath, of course). Again, the masons received 5 dirhems a dey
 and so did the layers of floor tiles and the tarrii.bin who made mortar
out of clay (turab) 1 lime, and gravel. The "mixers," khallii.tin, who d'td
the rough work, were paid 3-3-½ dirhems, like the other assisting
workmen, the "runners," or raqqa~in. The mujayyirun, or stucco-
workers, two of whom appeared on the fifth and sixth, and three on the
seventh day, got 6 or 7 dirhems, while one "master," mu'allim, also
received 7 and his "boy" (which here could mean his little son) 1
dirhem. Only the skilled laborers, such as the masons and the stucco-
workers, received lunch. It should be noted, however, that in one in-
stance, a report about repairs carried out in a synagogue around 1100,
lunch was provided also for the "runners." All in all, the differences
within the class of the skilled craftsmen or those within that of the
helpers were not considerable.25
 Needless to say, the economic law of supply and demand was not
entirely absent from the labor market in the Middle Ages. We have
had an inkling of its influence in the contract of 1057, discussed above.
Even more telling in this respect is an agreement made between a wage
earner (called ajir, "hireling") and his employer in June, 1127, which
regulated the payment of a debt owed by the former to the latter. The
employee was to receive a daily payment of 2 dirhems (of which half a
dirhem was deducted for payment of the debt). If he left his job at a
time of brisk business, however, the wage would be reduced retroac-
tively to 1-½ dirhems and, conversely, if his master dismissed him
before the debt was paid back in full, the wage would he increased
retroactively to 2-½ dirhems. In a similar contract, made ninety years
later, in May, 1217, the employee receives 3 dirhems a day (of which 1
was deducted for the payment of a debt) for the duration of ten
months. In case one of the two sides failed to fulfill the agreement, he
was fined with 5 dinars, to be paid to the holy shrine of Dammiih, then
the most popular place of pilgrimage for Egyptian Jews. 26 A third case
of an employee being in debt to his employer and eager to leave his job
is embodied in a moving petition by a Jewish silk-weaver whose fellow
workers were Muslims, and a Jewish renegade who molested him. From







the correspondence of Maimonides it ·appears that such loans used to
be given as advances to laborers when being hired by a master for
permanent service.27 Complaints about employees leaving their em-
ployers just when they were needed most, are not absent from the
Geniza letters.28
 According to both Muslim and Jewish law, "hire," that is, payment
for the services of a person or the use of a thing, was due at the end of
the period for which the payment was stipulated, normally a day for
wages and a month for the rent of a house. Even when a man would
"hire" his divorced wife for taking care of their little baby, payment
would be made at the end of the month, as it was fixed at a monthly
rate. While complaints by separated or divorced wives about delays in
the remittance of alimony were frequent, so far no case of putting off of
wages has been found in the Geniza records. Sometimes, an advance
would be granted to a craftsman, which he would return in case he did
not carry out the work ordered. 20
 As was common with public officials, 30 employees could be partly
remunerated by their employers paying their poll tax. Thus, a Tunisian
merchant mentions in a letter that he had paid 1- 2 ¾8 dinars for the
poll tax of his packer.51 Since, at the writing of that letter, a dinar
comprised an average of 36 dirhems and a skilled laborer earned 5
dirhems a day, the packer had to work two weeks (12 working days)
for his poll tax. In the case of the substitute for an overseer referred to
above, page 95, it was expressly stated that he had worked for half a
dirhem a day in order to be able to pay his poll tax to the amount of
1-% dinars. With the dinar worth around 40 dirhems at that time, the
poor man had to devote 132 working days to earn his poll tax. 32 When
we find employees indebted to their employers, we may assume that
the poll tax was largely to blame for that state of dependence.
 As for working hours, a twelfth-century manual of market supervi-
sion states (under the heading "Carpenters, sawyers, masons, ..."):
"Most workmen make an agreement about a specified daily wage, but
they come late in the morning and depart before evening. Terms must
be made to prevent this." 33 This seems to indicate that the medieval
Eastern craftsmen did not normally work from sunrise to sunset,
although they most probably did not take it as easy as their colleagues
in ancient Rome, who, according to Carcopino's ingenious, but perhaps
too optimistic calculations, worked only seven hours in summer and
less than six in winter:11 Since the Geniza contains references to part-
time work, there must have been accepted standards in this matter.35
Presumably, much depended on the character and moods of the two
sides concerned. Thus, according to a Geniza letter, the employee of an
ophthalmologist complained that his employer (who was also his rela-
tive) exploited him too much and did not even leave him time for
prayer.86 Compare with this a statement in a Spanish handbook of
market supervision, where the supervisor is advised to watch that the







 retailers and "the boys" in the stores prayed regularly. 87 For a medi-
 eval Jew, the day normally began with the attendance of the morning
 service, only after which was one allowed to take breakfast, and many
 would attend also the communal service in the late afternoon. A young
 man, traveling from Mazara in southwestern Sicily, which then was
 Muslim, to Messina on the northeastern tip of the island, which had
 already been conquered by the Normans, wrote home that his father
 could have a good income if he emigrated to Messina, but that it was
 impossible to live in that town, for people there were already through
 with the morning prayer at dawn (it should last through sunrise) and
 there was no communal afternoon service at all.38 The conditions of
 life, including the length of the working day, obviously varied from
 town to town.
The contracts on manual labor discussed thus far were all based on
 daily wages, even if they were concluded for a prolonged period such as
 a whole year. The same was the case with the Coptic linen-weavers of
 the famous industrial center of Tinnis, who were engaged in that work
 for all their lives, but still were paid daily.89 There were also other
 types of work contracts. We read in a Geniza letter about what seems
 to have been seasonal laborers namely "flax-combers," who lived with
 their employer, that is, got full board, received half a dinar per month
 in cash, and, moreover, were given working clothes, also of the value of
 half a dinar. The writer of that letter complains that for a young man
 sent to him he had to buy clothes at a price far in excess of the usual
 half a dinar and states that he would take him back only if he accepted
 the usual conditions of work as other young men of his type.40 In a
 letter from the beginning of the thirteenth century a workman asks his
 future employer what would be his weekly wages. Thus, while daily
 payment was the normal form of remuneration for manual work (so
 already in the Bible, Deuteronomy 24: 15), occasionally other arrange-
 ments were made as well. 41
Child labor is almost never mentioned in the Geniza papers, which is
 somewhat surprising, since so many other aspects of poverty are evi-
 dent in them. The insistence of the Jewish community on the schooling
 of orphans and the children of the poor, so vividly manifested in the
 Geniza records/ 2 might have acted as an obstacle to the spreading of
 the evil of child labor. A particularly sad case is reported in a letter
 from Alexandria, dated October 21, 1219, by a former official of the
 imperial mint of Old Cairo, who had lost his post, his house, and all his
 possessions. He hired out his boy, who walked naked in the streets, to a
 tailor who paid him half a dirhem per week. At the same time, four
 pounds of bread cost 1-¼ dirhems. Thus, the boy's daily ration con-
 sisted of about a quarter of a pound of b:read. But the very eloquent
 letter was addressed to the rich sister of the writer, and was probably
 exaggerated for obvious reasons. Moreover, it was written at the time
 of the invasion of the Franks-Damietta was taken by them on No-







vember 5-and, as indicated in the letter, the impositions connected
with the war had a terrible effect on the population of Alexandria in
general. 43 Thus far, no contract has been found in the Geniza compara-
ble to one contained in a papyrus from the year 877 in which a father
hired out his son against the provision of food and clothing.«
 In conclusion, employment was not the most common form of labor
reflected in the Geniza records. Cooperation largely took place through
partnership. As far as persons were employed, it was done, as a rule, on
the basis of daily wage.:;. These were rather stable throughout the
centuries and ranked from 1-½ to 3 dirhems for untrained or low-
grade workers to 4-7 dirhems for skilled masters. The wages for copy-
ists and similar "white-collar" jobs were among the lowest paid.


 4. THE MAlN INDUSTRIES
While scanning the Geniza records for the arts and crafts mentioned
 in them, the modern observer is impressed by the great number of
 occupations and by the high degree of specialization and division of
 labor apparent in them. The terms for about 265 manual occupations
 have been identified thus far, as against 90 types of persons engaged in
 commerce. and banking and approximately the same number of profes-
 sionals, officials, religious functionaries, and educators. With this total
 of around 450 professions compare the 150 or so professional corpora-
 tions traced in ancient Rome by J. T. Waltzing in his monumental
 Corporations professionelles on the one hand, and the 278 corporations
 de metier listed by Andre Raymond for Cairo in 1801, on the other.
 The collection of 435 colorful descriptions of Damascene occupations,
 begun by Muhammad Sa'id Qasimi during 1890 through 1900, and
 continued after his death by his son Jamal (but published only in
 1960) also includes agricultural laborers of different types, long lists of
 shopkeepers selling specialties, as well as musicians and other persons
 engaged in the entertainment business.1
Division of labor prevailed in the Geniza period not only in the great
 industries of textiles, dyeing, and clothing, of metals, glass, and pot-
 tery, and of building and food, as shown in the following, but also in
 n:any smaller branches. These examples may serve as illustrations:
 makers of kohl sticks, of writing cases (in which the scribes kept pen
 and ink attached to their belts), mirrors, fans, spindles, sieves, combs
(for hair and industrial purposes, in particular flax), manufacturers
 and stringers of beads of various descriptions, perforators of pearls,
 persons processing corals, or making ordinary or braided mats.2 A kohl
 stick {with which black eyelid powder is applied) is a small and trivial
 object. But, when we read in various marriage contracts that among a
 bride's trousseau such sticks are listed as valuable items, being made of
 all kinds of material, such as crystal, gold, or silver, we understand







that a man could well make a living by specializing in their production.
In every household, one or several women devoted a part of their time
to spinning; thus the demand for spindles must have been large enough
to encourage people to concentrate on making them. Beads and corals
were commodities that loomed large in the Mediterranean, as well as in
the Indian trade, and, naturally, they needed processing before being
shipped. Mats, of course, were found in every private home and public
building; they are mentioned very often in letters, as ordered, or sent
as a present, from Alexandria to Old Cairo or Qayrawan, or from
Aden, South Arabia, to India. A mat-maker could be an expert, care-
fully chosen for his task, and there are letters where mats are ordered
to measure and described in detail.3
 It is odd to find a man designated as a "sawduster." We know,
however, that sawdust was used, instead of sand, to dry a freshly
written page, and aa this material has actually been found between the
leaves of ancient Arabic manuscripts from .Spain, there were obviously
persons who specialized in the collecting, handling, and selling of
sawdust.' Since cushions and pillows represented a prominent part of
the equipment of a Mediterranean home, it is natural that "downers,"
the processors and sellers of down, formed a profession by themselves. 5
 In many cases we read about an object made, but not what the
profession of its maker was called. Thus, more than thirty different
types of containers in which goods were shipped are mentioned in the
Geniza letters, but only for one, the wickerwork baskets, has the
designation for their manufacturer been found in a Geniza record-a
craftsman from the island of Jerba off the Tunisian coast.6 From the
evidence preserved, though, we may safely conclude that almost each
container was manufactured by a different type of craftsman, and that,
in general, the actual number of manual occupations represented in the
Geniza papers was a multiple of the 265 listed so far. 1
 In some cases, the occupations mentioned were dominated either by
Muslims or Christians.8 Mostly, however, the reference is to Jews, and,
here, one has to bear in mind that religious and ethnic communities
used to specialize in certain professions, just as this was the case with
families and clans. I vividly recall a visit to a large factory for
tourists' souvenirs in Damascus in 1924, where the local Christians did
the woodwork, the Armenians made objects from mother-of-pearl,
while the Jews were the copper- and silversmiths. A similar denomina-
tional and ethnic division of labor was in operation in Geniza times.
The Jews were prominent in the textile industry and, above all, in
silk-work, as well as in dyeing, which was a pronouncedly Jewish
profession in all countries and in which they were thought to have
profess1onal secrets. 9 The production of glass was another favorite
Jewish occupation and so was metalwork of all descriptions, but
mainly silversmithing. Finally, many Jews were engaged in the food







industry, while pharmaceuticals, which was even more closely con-
nected with medicine than it is today, was to a large extent Jewish.
 It is, however, most characteristic of our period, which was compara-
tively free of castelike separation and restrictions, that religious and
ethnic occupational divisions were by no means rigid. We find Muslim
silk-workers, dyers, tanners, glassmakers, or pharmacists alongside
their Jewish fellow workers, even Muslim scholars, either whose fami-
lies engaged in these occupations or who worked at them in person. 10
The handbooks of market supervision, whether from Spain or from the
East, do not indicate that any occupation was confined to a certain
community. Accordingly, the Geniza shows us Jews in practically
every way of life, from vizier 11 down to blacksmith and sailor. But
their preponderance in certain occupations was a fact. Therefore, the
sketch of the main industries reflected in the Geniza records that
follows is to be taken as a cross section, rather than as a complete
picture, of the immensely rich gamut of Mediterranean arts and crafts
practiced during the High Middle Ages.
 Textiles and dyeing.-Comparable to the place of steel and other
metals in modern economy, textiles represented the major industry of
medieval times in the Mediterranean area. As far as the statistical
data available allow us to gauge, a very great proportion, perhaps the
majority, of the working population and certainly of the distributing
classes was engaged in this branch of economy. Textiles in those times
were more durable and more expensive than they are nowadays and
they seem to have been more variegated in fabric, color, and proveni-
ence than ours. Fantastic prices were paid for single selected pieces, the
so-called a'laq; this we know not only from literary sources, which
may be suspected of exaggeration, but also from business letters found
in the Geniza. Clothing formed part-sometimes a considerable
part-of a family's investment, being transmitted from parents to
children, to be converted into cash in case of an emergency. The
furniture of a house consisted mostly of various types of carpets,
couches, cushions, canopies, and draperies-objects produced mainly
by the textile industry. All this explains why the latter was of such
paramount importance.
 The general terms for spinner and weaver are not common in the
Geniza. 1~ Normally, a man is designated by a word referring to the
special branch of industry in which he was active, such as silk, flax, or
wool, or some more closely defined textile. It is to these that we now
turn our attention.
 It is appropriate to open our survey with the silk industry, for this
material, "which combines strength with lightness, durability with
 beauty and cleanliness with luster" is was favored in our period above
all others. Silk was produced all around the Mediterranean, even in
countries where climatic conditions were not favorable to sericulture,







such as Egypt. Still more impressive is the ubiquity of the industry
itself. Silk was woven and dyed not only in Fustat and Alexandria,
but also in the small towns of the Egyptian Rif. This is known to us
from business letters referring to raw silk that was sent to such places,
or was bought there from itinerant merchants, as well as from contracts
of tax farming concerned with the licenses for silk-weaving and silk-
dyeing in small towns. There are repeated references to silk-workers in
al-Mal)alla.14 Women, too, were engaged everywhere in the unraveling
and reeling, as well as in the weaving and dyeing of silk.
 The leading country in the production of silk in our period, at least
as far as the Geniza records go, was Spain.15 It exported cocoons and
raw silk, as well as finished products. The origin of this prominence is
perhaps to be sought in the fact that in early Islamic times Spain was
chiefly colonized by people coming from Syria and Lebanon, countries
with an ancient sericulture. Second to Spain was Sicily. Some Byzan-
tinists still seem to believe that the silkworm and the industry con-
nected with it were brought to Sicily by the Normans, when they
sacked the flourishing cities of Greece in 1147 and forcibly settled its
skilled laborers, male and female, in their own kingdom. Over a hun-
dred years ago, however, Michele Amari expressed his conviction that
the silk industry of Sicily must have been far older-a conviction
vindicated by abundant testimony from the Cairo Geniza. Throughout
the whole of the eleventh century we find both raw silk, called Sicilian,
and silk fabrics leaving the shores of the island, either from its western
points, Palermo and Mazara, or at Syracuse in the east. 16 In addition
to the usual filaments, Sicily produced, on the one hand, a very high-
priced variety, and, on the other, a cheaper sort, called liis'in, a term
extremely frequent in the Geniza records, but, it seems, not yet found
anywhere else. 17
 Tunisia, too, was a great exporter of silk and appears as such in
almost evei:y business letter sent from or to this country. Since, how-
ever, in all these letters, as far as I am able to see, no variety of silk is
called by the. name of the country or one of its towns, as is the case
with regard to Spain and Sicily, one is inclined to believe that refer-
ences throughout are to reexport and, in some cases, this is expressly
stated. A note going back to the eleventh century geographer al-Bakri
states that Gabes was the only place in Tunisia where mulberry trees
were planted and silk produced. Thus far, no mention of Gabes silk has
been found in the Geniza.18 The flourishing textile industry of Tunisia
processed Spanish and other silk, just as it did with Egyptian flax or
Sicilian cotton.
 It is amazing how little we hear in the Geniza about silk from Syria,
Lebanon, and Palestine. As is well known, silk was an important
article of export from the Crusader states of the Levant, and Damas-
cus was world famous for its silk products (hence English damask).







 Naturally, the Geniza records are not entirely reticent about Syro-
Palestinian silk and silk products, but these occasional references
 dwindle to insignificance, if compared with the broad and steady flow
of information about the import of these materials from the West.19 It
was perhaps the devastation of Syria and Palestine during the eleventh
century, so frequently referred to in our sources, which is to he blamed
for this state of affairs, while, after the advent of the Crusaders,
Europe most probably constituted a more profitable market for Syrian
silk than Egypt.
 The products of the renowned Byzantine silk industry, in particular
its brocade, its mandils, and the materials used for upholstery, were
very much in demand in other Mediterranean countries.20 It is, how-
ever, most remarkable that, with one possible exception, the Geniza
records do not speak of Byzantine raw silk as traded outside the
frontiers of the empire. This cannot be mere chance. Rather, it reflects
an imperial policy, which restricted the export trade to finished prod-
ucts, as indeed, is expressly stated in the "Book of the Prefect,"
chapter vi, paragraph 16: "The raw-silk dealers are not to sell silk to
Jews or to [other J merchants for resale outside the city." 21
 Iraqian raw silk, we learn, was traded in Alexandria, which seems
to have served as the exchange center of this material for all Egypt.22
Iraq also had a silk industry of its own. In this respect, however, it
was by far surpassed by its eastern neighbor, Iran. Despite its geo-
graphical remoteness, Iran was one of the main, if not the main, sup-
plier of high-priced silk fabrics for the Mediterranean countries dur-
3ng this period. Of first rank in this respect was 'fabaristan, the same
district south of the Caspian Sea, which, in later centuries, was the
main source of imported silk goods for most of Europe too. Other
3mportant centers of the silk industry were southwestern Iran, from
which the Tustari, Qurqubi, and many other popular silk fabrics came,
and Khoriisan in far northeastern Persia with its ibmim and other
specialities. Most of the Iranian silks were imitated in the West, but
for the eleventh century we have express references to imports from
lran. 23
 "Local," namely, Egyptian, silk was of an inferior quality, its price
being between one-quarter and one-third of the average. Since a
mother writing from Alexandria asks her son in Old Cairo to procure
her some, it must have been grown in the south, most probably in the
Fayyiim, to which province five hundred Syrians again transplanted
the cultivation of mulberry trees and the raising of silkworms early in
the nineteenth century. One of the fraudulent practices of Egyptian
weavers was to mingle "local" w3th Syrian silk and to sell it as
Syrian.H
 The wide geographical distribution of sericulture accounted in part
for the great variety of silk fabrics encountered in the Geniza records;







 another factor was the refined techniques of processing and dyeing silk
 and combining it with other fibers, such as flax or wool 1 or with gold or
 silver threads.
If we exclude the dyers, silk-workers were of two categories: the
 handlers of the cocoons and of raw silk, l}.ariri, and the weavers, qazzaz
 (including the specialist mull],im, who wove a silk warp with a woof
 of another material). The cocoon of the silkworm consists of two dif-
 ferent parts: a core of compact, continuous filament-the only animal
 fiber that needs no spinning; this has to be unraveled and reeled, a
 task confided to specialists called naqqatj, or "unraveler." For although
 this work may be done even by children, it requires expert knowledge
 and great dexterity to do it in a commercially sound way. "Do not
 move with your silk," writes a merchant from Alexandria to his corre-
 spondent in Old Cairo, at a time when the material was scarce, "except
 in the event that trustworthy unravelers are available, who might
 unravel a small quantity [literally: "a small reel"] good for the
 countryside," that is, ·who were able to pick out the inferior variety
 traded outside the capital. 25
The layers of loose filament covering the core of the cocoon (the
 so-called waste silk) have to be spun like other fibers. As opposed to
 manqiltj, unraveled silk, we often find in the Geniza letters maqshur or
 muqashshar, "peeled off" silk and the worker handling it called
 muqashshir "peeler." 26 It is interesting that the modern Italian word
 for floss silk (tangled waste silk), catarzo, already appears in a business
 letter of the eleventh century (in the form qatarish). Fraudulent
 weavers mingled it with raw silk, after both had been dyed. 27
The preponderance of Jews in the silk industry as reflected in the
 Geniza records might have had its origin in the fact that it was an
 ancient local industry in Palestine,28 or in the wide-ranging travels of
 the Jewish Rahdaniyya merchants of the ninth century, which brought
 them regularly to China, where they might have had opportunity to
 make themselves acquainted with the professional intricacies of silk
 production. 29 The two factors might have acted in combination and
 there were, perhaps, others such as the reluctance of the Muslim
 divines to approve of the wearing of this luxurious material. In any
 case, the Jews by no means had a monopoly in this branch. In his
 studious Ph.D. thesis about the economic activities of Muslim scholars
 prior to the time of the Crusaders, quoted above, Hayyim J. Cohen
 found no less than 131 who either bore the family names silk-worker,
 silk-weaver, or silk merchant, or were reported as having been actually
 engaged in these occupations..
Flax looms very large in the Geniza, eYen larger than silk, or indeed
 than a11 other fibers combined. For flax was the main industrial crop of
 Egypt, and at least 22 local Yarieties appear in our records. It is the
 trade, however, not the industry, which is reflected in them, and there-
 fore the discussion of these details is reseiTed for chapter iii. The word







 kattiin, which in Arabic designates both flax and linen, should in most
 cases be taken in the first meaning, for it was flax fiber, not linen
 fabric, that formed the main object of international trade, as far as
 reflected in the Geniza. Consequently, we mostly hear about work
 connected with the preparation of flax and not the weaving of linen.
After having been pulled, the flax plant has to be retted, that is,
 soaked in water in order to separate the fiber from the woody core.
 While exposed to dampness, the plants have to be turned. These
 operations were done by the farmers themselves. Therefore, the prod-
 uct in this stage of preparation was called in the technical language of
 the Geniza letters "flax of the farmers." 30 After this, the "flax-
 workers" took over, first to do the scutching, that is, the beating of the
 dried plant in order to separate the fiber from the seeds, the seeds to be
 used for the preparation of "hot oil" or "seed oil," as it was called at
 that time. In this stage, too, the flax was traded, designated as
 ''scutched flax." 31 Then came the hatcheting, that is, combing out,
 disentangling, and cleaning of the fibers, a most responsible task, as the
 quality of the yarn depended largely on this operation. Three times it
 is said in one letter that the addressee should supervise "the combing"
 himself and not buy flax that had already been hatcheled. A scholarly
 merchant who was on the eve of a trip to Yemen, "had it not been for
 the famine," was asked by his correspondent to go to Sunbat and to
 have the flax combed there in person.32 After this operation, the flax
 fiber was ready for spinning. The combed-out scrap of flax was also an
 article of trade. 33 When a bashful young Jewish man is recommended
 in a letter as being very good at kattan work, certainly the scutching
 and hatcheling of flax, not the artistic weaving of linen, was intended. 34
 Weaving was the domain of the heirs of ancient Pharaonic Egypt, the
 Christian Copts.
Cotton, today the staple crop of Egypt, was of no ~reat consequence
 in our period. In its raw state, it was imported into Egypt both from
 Syria and from the West (Sicily, Tunisia), as we read repeatedly in the
 Geniza records. 35 Cotton goods, of course, were one of the main im-
 ports, both from Tunisia and from India. Therefore, we hear much
 about the trade in cotton, but ne:xt to nothing about its manufacture. 36
Sheep-breeding seems to have been ubiquitous owing to the then
 very vital cheese production connected with it, and wool must have
 been available everywhere for industrial purposes. Egypt appears in
 the Geniza papers both as an exporter and as an importer of wool and
 hair. 37 Any clothing, including even the huge buqyar turbans, could
 be made from this material, and, as far as finer fabrics are concerned,
 as in classical times it was used in particular for purple cloth. 38 Wool-
 makers or sellers, f}awwaf, are frequently mentioned, but no noteworthy
 technical details about this industry have been listed so far. 39
In addition to the main textiles, silk, flax, cotton, and wool, some
 minor fibers are mentioned in the Geniza records, such as hemp, which







was used for the manufacture of ropes. A Jewish ropemaker, designated
 as ~abbal, the term still used in Damascus, possessed a house in that
city. A person engaged in the same occupation in Fustat, addressed as
 "illustrious elder" in a letter, was called a~bali. A fanciful material was
 "sea wool," made of threads produced by a large marine mollusk, which
 have a golden luster and take on various colors during the day. Known
 in Italy from Roman times to the present day, it was counted by the
 Muslims as one of the marvels of "the \Vest," and the Umayyad rulers
 of Spain used to forbid its export. In a large order for precious textiles
 we find also one for two covers of sea wool, each twenty-four cubits
 long and woven together with green and red silk.4-0
The high degree of specialization and division of labor, noted above
 as characteristic for the industry of the Mediterranean area in the
 High Middle Ages was particularly conspicuous in the dyeing industry.
 This was due to the enormous variety of colors, favored in those times,
 and to the great skill and experience required in using the many
 natural and industrial dyes available. While men today are normally
 satisfied with various shades of gray, brown, blue, black, and white, the
 medieval man, like tropical singing birds, liked, in addition to these
 colors, green, red, and intense yellow, and, above all, intricate nuances
 with all kinds of "glitter," "gloss,'' iridescence, stripes, waves, and
 patterns.41 Needless to say, the fair sex did not lag behind in this
 respect, although the colorful fabrics were displayed within the four
 walls of a house or the "Turkish" bath, rather than in public. The
 carpets, couches, and drapery decorating the rooms showed the same
 variety in coloring and treatment as the clothing.
The Geniza people were by no means barbarians running riot with
 colors. The careful descriptions of the exact hues desired and the
 frequent requests that the colors of the parts of a dress ordered-even
 of shoes and a dress-match each other, betray taste, although most
 probably a taste different from our own. Moreover, as we learn both
 expressly and indirectly, there were marked differences between one
 country and another in this respect. Iran, it seems, was most extrava-
 gant in its predilection for variety in colors, while austere Jerusalem,
 and Palestine in general, preferred simple black and red. In any case,
 the taste of the people represented in the Geniza papers was widely
 different from that of the Iraqian dandies of the early-tenth century
 known to us so well from a special study devoted to them by a
 contemporary. 42
In order to give the reader an idea of the color-intoxication of this
 age, a few quotations from orders for textiles and from lists of trous-
 seaus are given here: "Five fine covers, one gazelle blood, one pure
 violet, one musk-colored [i.e., reddish brown], one silvery, one intense
 yellow; two others pure, clean white, inclining to yellow." "Eight pairs
 of [small] prayer carpets, two white, two indigo blue, two green, two
 red." "Please, my lord, the red should be as red as possible, likewise the







white and the yellow should be exquisite, I was not satisfied with the
yellow.... The siglaton robe is of the utmost beauty, but not exactly
what I wanted, for it is white and blue, while I wanted to have, instead
of the latter, onion color, an 'open' color. The lead-colored [i.e.,
bluish gray J robe is superb, better than all the rest." ,s
 In the lists of the clothing and bedding brought in by a bride, colors
are not regularly indicated, because the description of an item and the
fabric from which it was made were sufficient for its identification.
Therefore the reader has to bear in mind that the specifications given
here for two such lists refer only to a minority of the materials
mentioned. The trousseau of the daughter of an India merchant, mar-
ried in Old Cairo in 1146, contained items in the following colors:
white, 6; cloud blue, 3; cloud blue with gold threads, 1; pomegranate
red, 4; blue, 3; pearl-colored, 2; ash gray CC'color of bamboo crystals"),
2; green, 2; saffron, 1; not yet identified, 4.44 Another bride, from the
same time and environment, had quite a different taste: pearl-colored,
4; white with golden threads, 3; violet, 2; blue, 2; unbleached linen, 2;
basil-colored (brownish violet), 1; sky blue, 1; cloud blue, 1; white, 1;
gilded, 1; emerald, 1; sand-colored, 1; not yet identified, 4.45
 In the face of such demands on their art, the dyers had to specialize
according to the coloring matter used by them. Thus we find specialists
in crimson, saffron, sumac, purple, vermilion, or indigo, and so on. 46
Even when a person was not called qirmizini, za'farani, or sammiiq,
that is, dyers with crimson, saffron, or sumac (the English words are
derived from the Arabic), but was designated by the general word
dyer, we hear occasionally that one was engaged in dyeing red or
another in dyeing silk with turquoise blue:47 In legal deeds, too, the
dyes used in the workshop referred to would be indicated.48 All this
points to a high degree of specialization in this industry.
 The dyeing represented a large percentage of the final cost of a
fabric. An eleventh-century account gives the following details:
 Dinars
Unbleached silk, 66 pounds300
Loss •9 on these20
Crimson for the dyeing85
Expenses (customs, etc.)25
Wages for the dyers 20
For dyeing antimony-black and green 110 24
Total 174
Grand Total 474
 Quantity of dyed silk, 63 pounds.
Thus, out of a total cost of 474 dinars, 129 dinars, more than a
quarter, were spent on the dyeing. The price of the coloring matter was
more than four times as much as the wages for the dyers. 111







In addition to dyeing, fibers and fabrics had to undergo various
 other treatments before being ready for use, in particular processes
 of bleaching and blanching, about which we read very much in the
 Geniza records. These, as well as other aspects of the clothing industry,
 such as glossing, tailoring, lining, and embroidery are treated in my
 chapter on clothing (Vol. III, chap. viii, sec. C). Each process and
 each pjece of clothing was attended to by a separate group of artisans
 specializing in it. Some of these groups were very large, such as the
 ghalii'ilis, the manufacturers of the ghilala, or women's undergarments;
 the maqani'is, makers of the miqna'a, or women's scarves; or the
 farrii's 1 or furriers. Others manufactured pieces of clothing worn only
 by special groups of the population, such as the IJ,ibriiwis, makers of a
 dark veil with which ladies of a certain class used to cover themselves
 while going out. Jews manufactured the ~ibrii', but no Jewish bride
 ever got one in her trousseau. 52
Metals, glass, and pottery.-Next to textiles, metals and minerals,
 and above all the gold, silver, copper, and iron industries, were pre-
 dominant in medieval arts and crafts. Goldwork and silverwork,
 including jewelry in general, must be mentioned first, because in actual
 life they occupied a position quite different from the one they have
 today. Besides their function as ornaments, they served largely as a
 means of investment and savings. A great variety of forms and combi-
 nations of metals and precious stones appear in the lists of trousseaus
 and other Geniza documents, and even where gold and silver were
 traded as metal, the merchants preferred to have them in ornaments
 rather ~han in bars. Moreover, silver vessels were much more in use
 than they are nowadays. As for copper, many of the better kitchen
 utensils were made of this material, which appears regularly near the
 end of longer lists of marriage portions, as do gold and silver orna-
 ments at their beginnings.
The general word for goldsmith and silversmith in Arabic, l}a'igh,
 means "one who gives form." It was used all over the Arabic-speaking
 world, and, like French orfevre and Spanish platero, referred to both
 metals, perhaps because they were normally handled by one and the
 same artisan. Despite the meaning of the term, we find the :;;a'igh occu-
 pied with the refining of precious metals in Egypt in the twelfth century
 and in Morocco in the eighteenth. There must also have been specialists
for goldsmithing, as the relevant word dhahabi, "gold man," is en-
 countered very frequently in the Geniza, although curiously enough,
 it is not registered in the Arabic dictionaries. The famous Muslim
 historian al-Dhahabi was called after the profession of his father who
 daqq al-dhahab, manufactured thin leaves of gold, one of the many
 special branches into which goldsmithing was divided. 58 The correspond-
ing Hebrew zehiivi was a familiar term in Talmudic Literature. Another
branch of this craft was that of the "maker of ornaments," or jeweler,
l}allii."







 In addition to coppersmiths in general, we find persons specializing
in casting or hammering this metal, which was traded either as cast or
hammered. 55 Copper was often alloyed with tin (for the manufacture
of bronze vessels), wherefore "tinner," trader in, or processor of, tin, is
a term and a family name common in the Geniza.56 Tin dishes and
other vessels, so frequent in medieval Poland and other northern Euro-
pean countries, have not been traced thus far in our papers.
 Lead was another metallic substance much in use and much traded,
and was handled by specialists, whose workshop was called "kitchen,"
as in other industries requiring processes of heating ("cooking'') .67 A
by-product of this industry was litharge, an oxide of lead used in the
manufacture of glass and other materials, and in medicine for the
preparation of a popular eye powder. The preparers of the lead oxide
also formed a profession by themselves.118
 The metal industry was subdivided not only according to the mate-
rials and the various treatments required by them, but even more by
the type of objects made. For example, bells, in particular the little
bells on the necks of beasts of burden, were even more vital in the
crowded narrow streets of that period than the horns in our cars today.
Therefore, bell-makers, as the Geniza shows, must have been numerous
on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, as they were in Milan,
Italy, in 1288, when an enthusiastic encomium of that city described
the makers of the sweet-sounding brass bells that were attached to the
breasts of the horses as one of its marvels. 59 The ubiquitous urban
blacksmiths were probably occupied mostly with horseshoes, a com-
modity as commonplace then as tires are now. 00 Locksmiths are less
frequently mentioned, for the locks on doors of houses and rooms were
 at that time of wood (as they still are in Yemen) and made by
carpenters, or rather a particular group, or even groups, of carpenters
specializing in this commodity.61 There were, of course, cutlers, as well
 as craftsmen concentrating on spoons and ladles (forks were not used
 in those days), but also on such objects as hooks, razors, and needles.62
 Each of the major copper implements used in the kitchen, such as
mortars or canisters (these appear in the trousseaus in sets of six) had
its expert manufacturers, the latter even giving a name to a street. 63
Tinkers were numerous. In one document a mender of pots has claims
 on a Bible codex. 84 The manufacture of arms also was very much
 specialized, but the Jews represented in the Geniza papers, unlike those
 in nineteenth century Yemen, do not seem to have participated in this
 3ndustry.
 The manufacture of glass must have been one of the favorite Jewish
 occupations. This could have been assumed even on the basis of spo-
 radic references in literary sources. It is proved beyond doubt by the
testimony of the Geniza records. Various factors might have contrib-
 uted to this predilection. The PalesUne-Lebanese coast between Acre
 and Tyre had been a center of glass manufacture since remote antiq-







 uity and continued as such during the Geniza period.65 Thus an old
tradition was operative in this case; indeed "Jewish glass" was a term
 familiar in France as early (or should we say: as late?) as the seventh
 century A.D. 66 The elaborate Jewish dietary and purity laws could be
 more easily observed with the use of glass vessels.67 Tentatively, two
 other reasons might be adduced. Jews were everywhere closely con-
nected with the royal or provincial mints. In these, and in assaying in
general, glass weights were used for determining the exact weight of
coins ~nd weights, and modern scholars have marveled at the fact that
medieval craftsmen had been able to produce glass weights precisely
indicating fractions of a gram. Another favorite Jewish occupation,
pharmaceuticals, also used glass vessels of different description, size,
and color, as we learn again from the Geniza.68 The most plausible
explanation perhaps is this: glassblowing in a hot climate, under the
primitive technological conditions of those days, must have been an
extremely exacting and uncomfortable occupation. So, why not leave
it to the Jews? Here, as in other cases, however, there by no means
existed denominational exclusiveness. The house of a Jewish goldsmith
in Old Cairo bordered on that of a Christian glassmaker, and Copts
are known as manufacturers of glass weights. 60
 Besides Tyre and Beirut, Egypt itself was a great center of the glass
industry with an age-old tradition, stemming from Pharaonic times.
The excavations of Fustat, carried out by George T. Scanlon in 1964--
1965, have brought to light glass manufactured during the early Ab-
basid period. It seems that it was not Alexandria, as in the Roman
period, but Old Cairo that was the main producer, for most of the
Geniza material on glass manufacture comes from the latter city. The
glass manufactured there was called "local," an epithet that smacks
slightly of inferior quality. It may have been ref erred to also in a letter
from Aden, where the writer orders "a wickerwork basket with red
glasses from Beirut, and if they cannot be had, white glasses." 70 We
also hear of a Byzantine glassmaker traveling from Alexandria to
Cairo and "a Jewish glassmaker" delivering in Old Cairo letters "from
the West," destined for people in Alexandria, which seems to indicate
that he himself had come by land from Tunisia.71 An eleventh-century
Mr. Glaser in Ramle, Palestine, was a dealer in oil. 72 Four contracts of
partnership in glass workshops and three fragments referring to em-
ployment in this industry have come to light so far (see p. 87, above,
and pp. 363,365, below).
 Pottery, albeit sparsely represented in the Geniza, also must have
been much specialized, as evident from our records. The fakhkhiir,
Jakhuri, or fiikhuriini, manufactured clay pipes and other clay material
used in buildings and installed them himself, wherefore he appears in
documents related to the repair of houses. The products of this industry
are mentioned also as sent as a gift (fresh earthenware for Passover),
or as exports from Rosetta, Egypt, to Sicily. 78 The qaddiir made pots







 and other receptacles, sent, for example, from Tinnis, Lower Egypt, to
 Ramie, Palestine. 74 No doubt, here too, each type of vessels was made
 by a separate group of artisans, although so far only two have been
 noted: the kuzi, maker of narrow-necked water jugs without a spout,
 and the ghaq,ii'iri, the manufacturer of porcelain-like translucent
 dishes. 71' The mukhfiyiit pottery, eight pieces of which were sent from
 Spain to Egypt in 1137 (a year of heavy warfare in the Mediterranean),
 was a specialty of the Muslim West. 76 But whether maddar, "worker
 in clay," was a technical or a dialectical variant, cannot be made out
 at present, for it was noted only for Mosul, where the word might have
 been only a local term for the first or second occupation mentioned at
 the beginning of this paragraph.77 The great variety of forms developed
 by the ceramics industry of that period is reflected in inventories of
 pharmacies, doctors' dispensaries, and stores, as well as in occasional
 references with regard to private homes.
Leather, parchment, and paper.-In the absence of synthetic fabrics,
 leather played a far more important role in the period under discussion
 than it does today. It even seems that it was more widely used than in
 Greco-Roman times, which may perhaps be explained as a remnant
 from nomadic Arabia, when hides were more easily available than
 pottery. Hides, skins, and various types of leather bags served as
 receptacles for overseas transport, while leather bottles were normally
 used in daily life for carrying oil, wine, or other fluids, but also for
 flour. Makers of leather bottles are frequently mentioned in our rec-
 ords, and a street was named after them in Old Cairo.78 There was
 hardly a larger consignment of goods going from the West to Egypt
 which did not include hides or skins. An eleventh-century account from
 Sicily lists 63 Syracusan oxhidcs and 76 buckskins and a late letter
 sent inside Egypt deals with hides of water buffaloes and cattle.79
Since transport inside a town or overland was by riding beasts,
 saddle-making was a great industry .80 Shoes were perhaps worn less
 than in our own days, but there was a great variety of them, and
 people must have been very particular in this respect, since we find
 orders for shoes from one country to another even for personal use. In
 one single list, three types of shoemakers are mentioned, and corre-
 spondingly various kinds of footwear appear in our records. To be sure,
 not all of these were made of leather. In Spain, then as today, cork-
 wood was a familiar material.81
Hides, in various states of treatment, were found in every household;
 for the low, movable table on which one dined was put on a hide, in
 order to protect the carpets from stains and for easy disposal of crumbs
 and other food remains. Such dining-room hides were often given as
 presents and most probably were appropriately decorated.
Certain references in Muslim and other medieval sources convey the
 impression that tanning was an exclusively or predominantly Jewish
 occupation. 82 This, however, is not borne out by the Geniza records.







 Whether in lists of taxpayers, donators, or receivers of alms, in legal
 documents or private correspondence, tanners appear only sporadically
 and the family name Tanner is also extremely rare. Similarly, the
 Muslim handbooks of market supervision clearly indicate that this
 profession was not exercised primarily by non-Muslims. Dr. Hayyim J.
 Cohen (see p. 104, above) notes eight early Muslim scholars whose
 family name was Tanner.
Although the invention of paper restricted the use of parchment and
 vellum, still they were very much in demand in our period. Torah
 scrolls and the sacred writings of Muslims and Christians, as far as
 used in public service, were written on vellum and so were many other
 religious, scientific, and literary works, as we learn from book lists
 found in the Geniza, and, of course, from manuscripts that have been
 preserved. Certain types of deeds, such as marriage contracts and bills
 of divorce and manumission, and many others also were written on this
 durable material as were epistles emanating from authorities, espe-
 cially if they had the character of circular letters. In Tunisia, private
 letters and accounts were written on parchment well down to the
 middle of the eleventh century, while in the East the transition to
 paper must have been made about a hundred years earlier, as the
 relevant material from the Geniza proves. The reason for this differ-
 ence was the fact that Tunisia and Sicily were great centers for the
 manufacture of leather and the export of hides. 83
In addition to the parchment-maker, the bookbinder was an impor-
 tant representative of the leather industry. As we learn from one letter,
 leather book covers were sent ready-made from the West to Egypt.
 Unfortunately, no details are given about these covers except that they
 were square; since we read that Tunisia exported even gilded shoes, it
 is likely that the book covers sent to Alexandria were similarly deco-
 rated, as indeed are many Islamic book covers. In a book list from
 the middle of the twelfth century nine covers are red, six are black,
 and five white (the latter, I understand, being quite unusual).84
Pape:- looms very large in the Geniza records. They tell us, much
 about the trade in this commodity and its uses, but nothing about its
 production. Above, page 81, it has been suggested that paper, like
 sugar, was manufactured in factory-like, larger establishments rather
 than in small workshops, as was the practice in other industries of that
 time. Paper was needed in large quantities even in a small provincial
 town (as we learn from repeated orders issued there) because this was
 a civilization to which God uhad given the pen" (Koran 96:4; Mishna
 Avoth 5: 6). Everyone wrote letters and kept accounts, and even poor
 people prided therr..selves in possessing books, which, in addition to
 their spiritual value, served as a durable investment like jewelry.
 Moreover, as in our own civilization, paper was used for wrapping and
 was made into containers. 85
The building industry.-Building operatfons were normally carried







out by specialists. When we find that in a small town like Hebron,
Palestine, all the members of the local community participated in
pulling down a synagogue and erecting a new one on a larger site, this
was done in order to have it completed as quickly as possible, and the
building, according to the dimensions mentioned, must have been of
modest size.86 Mostly, we read in our papers about repairs, and these,
as a rule, were effected by experts.
 There were stonecutters, but the main building material in Old
Cairo was brick, tub, from which Spanish and English adobe is derived.
The master masons were normally assisted by one or more helpers, and
sometimes two and more masons worked together. Quite a number of
specialists were needed, such as layers of clay pipes and of floor tiles,
wall-plasterers, marble-workers (bathrooms in better houses and
often also the inner courts were surfaced with marble slabs), makers
of ovens and of cesspools, and others whose exact functions have not
yet been defined with certainty. Finally, there were the decorators of
rooms such as the stucco-workers; when we read that in a poor town
like Jerusalem, a decorator received 114 dirhems in wages, we must
infer that this type of work constituted a considerable part of the
expenditure on the erection or the upkeep of a house. Whether the
muzawwiq, or painter-a word derived from za'uq, mercury-mad e
murals or ornamented buildings otherwise, is not yet evident. 87 The
muhandiz (with z, like its Persian etymology) was not an architect or
engineer as in modern Arabic, but a land surveyor, who had to deal with
fixing or checking boundaries of lots and houses and estimating the
values of houses and amounts of rents. 88
 Carpenters and sawyers are also regularly mentioned in connection
with building operations. Modern builders get the lumber needed for a
house ready for use from a yard. In the Geniza records we see that the
proprietor bought the timber, then first employed sawyers to saw it on
the spot according to the dimensions required, and later on a carpenter
would fix the beams, staircases, railings, and other parts made of wood.
Doors and the like were manufactured in the carpenter's shop, also, it
seems, as a specialty work. 89
 Furniture made of wood was used far less in those days than is
customary in our civilization. In its manufacture, the carpenters were
joined by the turners and the chestmakers, both Jarge professions,
which gave their names to a gate and a street, respectively, in Old
Cairo. The windows of the houses were covered with grilles of different
designs, and as we know from woodwork still extant, the Baroque
taste of the period preferred everything carved and turned. Any bride
of a better family brought into her new home a ~andiiq, or chest, where
she kept her wardrobe. This explains the importance of these two
occupations.90 The carpenters specializing in the making of wooden
door locks have been referred to above, page 109.
 The preparation of food.-The higher a civilization, the mote· it







 devolves the preparation of food from the shoulders of the housewife to
 specialized industries. In a primitive economy, as in most parts of
 Yemen, South Arabia, women get up long before sunrise for the toil-
 some work of grinding the stone mill and baking bread, and in many
 houses bread is baked for each meal anew, for their menfolk like to eat
 it warm and fresh, as it comes from the oven. We normally buy our
 bread and cakes ready-made in the store.
The c1vilization represented in the Geniza records ranks somewhere
 between these two extremes, but is decidedly nearer our own. Each
 house would lay in stores of wheat, but the women were not expected to
 do the grinding. This was done by millers found all over the city.91
 When a husband went overseas on extended travels, he would assign to
 his wife fixed quantities of wheat and money for grinding it.92 One
 could also buy flour (of different grades of fineness) in stores specializ-
 ing in this commodity.93 The baking would be done by a baker, and
 many would simply buy loaves of bread, which, for easier computation,
 normal1y had the weight of one pound. 94
Cakes, called ka'k in Arabic (a word that seems, however, not to be
 connected with its English equivalent), also were normally bought in
 the bazaar, and the name or designation ka'ki, or cake master, is rather
 frequent.95 Here is an order to a cake master, carefully written on a
 tiny piece of paper: "To the elder Abi Sa'd-may God preserve him.
 Please receive two pennies as earnest money and give the bearer a
 pound oi well done ringlets [probably a type of doughnut], and if you
 make cakes tomorrow, prepare two pounds of little cakes of utmost
 smallness for me." 96 The pastrycook, khamiri, was another familiar
 figure. 97
A fourteenth-century Muslim scholar describes how Jewish cake
 makers used to squirt sesame oil on the cakes from their mouth and
 warns true believers not to defile themselves by a liquid that had been
 in the mouth of an infidel. The student of Karaite literature is re-
 minded of a passage in a famous epistle directed by a leader of this
 queer sect against the majority of the Jews, the Rabbanites: "How can
 I keep silent when many of them eat meat from carcasses skinned by
 Gentiles? The Gentiles fill their mouth with water, then sprinkle it
 over the flesh of the carcass which they are skinning so that their saliva
 is blown between the flesh and the hide." Such warnings, although
 inspired by the religious rigorism of the Middle Ages, were certainly
 conducive to hygiene. 98
Canned and frozen foods (as differentiated from preserves, which
 were common even in antiquity) are modern inventions. The medieval
 society represented in the Geniza papers had an equivalent for these
 means of alleviating a housewife's life, an equivalent indeed, which is
 only sparely used by us. Many dishes were prepared by specialist cooks
 in the bazaar, from where they were brought home and served fresh.
 Respectable people did not dine out in those days. Workmen, in whose







 wages lunch was often included, probably had to do so. But for a
 member of the middle class it was a disgrace to take his meal at the
 shop of the harras, the preparer of the har'isa, the medieval hamburger
 (ground meat and wheat fried in much fat). 119 This, as well as the food
 prepared by the maker of jash'ish (groats cooked together with meat and
 dates), or by the "roaster," shawwa', the "dinner cook," 'ashshi, or the
 "meat cook," tabbakh, in general, were rather taken home, and so were
 the various cold dishes, such as relishes made by the bawiiridi, vinegar
 sauce and other appetizers prepared by the kamukhi, or flavored
 waters sold by the mutarri.100 All a smart housewife had to do was to
 tell her husband in the morning what to bring home for dinner in the
 evening.
The Geniza records distinguish among butcher, meat-seller, meat-
 carver, and slaughterer, from whom the slaughterer of goats is again
 differentiated-a specialization brought into relief by the repeated
 warnings of a handbook of market supervision not to mix beef or
 mutton with the meat of goats.101 Sausages, called in Jewish Aramaic
 and in Arabic naqaniq, which is Semitized Latin Lucanica, that is,
 coming from Lucania in southern Italy, are mentioned in the Talmud
 and in Muslim literature, but not in the Geniza. The sausage-makers
 also formed a separate group.102
There were so many types of sweetmeats that even a very elaborate
 handbook on market supervision had difficulty in encompassing all the
 specialists handling them and the techniques required in their prepara-
 tion.108 The zalabani, the preparer of a pancake made of unleavened
 dough, honey, almonds, and other ingredients, was particularly popular
 and we have found even a scholar engaged in this occupation.104 Another
 popular sweetmeat, the qata'if, was likewise made of flour and
 almonds.105 The lawwazin, men processing or selling almonds, appear
 frequently in the Geniza, and a street in Old Cairo was named after
 them.108 The "fryer," qi'ili, it seems, prepared the various fried seeds
 that people used to nibble.101
The secret of artificial ice was not yet known in those days. Ice and
 snow were imported from the mountains of Palestine and Syria into
 Egypt and kept in subterranean receptacles for the hot summer days,
 when they were sold at extravagant prices. Thus, the thalliij, or "ice
 man, 11 was a merchant with much capital, not a manufacturer. 108
The industries connected with oil, wine, honey, sugar, dairy farming,
and fisheries are treated separately and the same applies to the very
 much ramified transport business. 109
Government control of industry.-The Fatimid government, as we
 have seen, operated large workshops, especially for the manufacture
of textiles required for the imperial wardrobe and for the distribution
of robes of honor. The mint and arsenals for the needs of army and
navy were other state establishments. Moreover, government taxed
practically every industrial activity, which gave it also excellent







 opportunity to supervise each individual workshop. Maqrizi, the great
 antiquarian, has preserved a list of the revenue from this tax from the
 end of the Fatimid period. 110 The estimates of income from each indus-
 try were fixed, since the taxes were farmed out (see above, p. 73),
 usually for several years. The tax on silkwork and silk-dyeing in Fustat
 brought 334 dinars per year. By chance, a Geniza document from 1147
 gives the amount of the same revenue from al-Ma}:ialla as 335 dinars,
 which is not surprising. The Maimonides responsum discussed above,
 page 88, shows that the Jewish silk-workers of al-Ma}:ialla were at
 least as strong as those of Fustat. 111 (With today's Egyptian revival
 al-Mal_ialla is again a great industrial center.) From another Geniza
 document we learn that the taxes on silkwork were specified according
 to its various stages, which were undertaken by different craftsmen.
 The tax reforred to was paid for "the untangling and unraveling of
 silk." 112 The finished products were stamped with the seal of the tax
 collector. 113 Fabrics woven or dyed in private homes (which was pro-
 hibited), or which were otherwise manufactured under evasion of the
 tax due) could be immediately recognized by the absence of the stamp
 and were therefore traded only to acquaintances, who, however, did not
 always keep the secret. Such an occurrence is reported in a court record
 from M.aHj, written around 1100.114 In another provincial town, and ap-
 proximately at the same time, a sum of 13 dirhems was paid for "the
 refining of the sugar [the quantity was known to the addressee of the
 letter] and the tax on it." 115 The amounts of the revenue even from
 industries of considerable dimensions in Fustat were modest, 350 dinars
 from the spinning workshops, 236 from the potters, 240 from the manu-
 facturers of the popular 'fabaristan upholstery. No complaints about
 these taxes have been found in letters and no references to them in
 contracts (except one from late Mamluk times). Thus, they can hardly
 have been of great economic import. The subject of government control
 is discu.ssed in greater detail in the concluding section of the chapter
 on commerce.


 5. AGRICULTURE AND FISHERY
 The Mediterranean area of the High Middle Ages was characterized
 by its highly mercantile economy. Still, whoever could afford it pos-
 sessed land and looked after its yields, whether this was a Muslim
 judge in Ghaza, Palestine, or the scribe of a Jewish court in Old Cairo.
 From a query submitted to Maimonides it is evident that it was
 common practice for Jews to entrust their fields, vineyards, orchards
 and gardens to Gentile sharecroppers.1 Despite the glamour of the
 capital, many preferred to live in little towns or in villages. This fact
 has already been stressed above, page 54, in connection with the
 amazing number of foreigners settling in the Egyptian Rif, or country-







side. Here it must be added that at least some of these were connected
with agriculture. The son of an immigrant from Baghdad, whose father
had been active in Old Cairo for many years, settled in a village near
Minyat Zif ta, a little town in the Nile delta, and was entirely occupied
there with farm products, while a newcomer from Palestine, living in
the capital, possessed fields in another location attended to by his
cousin, also .a Palestinian.2 The richer people invested a considerable
part of their income in farming. A will of a notable divides his landed
property, his flocks of sheep, and all the orchards possessed or leased
by him between his brother and his children, which indicates that these
agricultural possessions and rights had been inherited from the father
of the testator. 3 A settlement between partners in precious stones
reveals that they also shared farming land in common; one partner
receives 120-½ dinars in cash and the other all the flax and other crops,
which proves that the land possessed by them must have been of very
considerable extent.4 The amirs, or generals, were of course the great
landowners. From a plot belonging to a Jewish pious foundation an
amir got his regular dues. 5 As we shalI see, the nagids of the Jewish
community, rivaled the amirs in this matter.
 From Muslim handbooks of administration we learn that in our
period even the highest officials were paid partly in cash and partly in
kind, particularly in wheat and barley. We also read in a Geniza letter
that a newly appointed local mushiirif, or superintendent of revenue,
received an annual 'awn, or salary, of 180 dinars and 100 irdabb
 (about 9,000 liters) of grain. Even of bribes-or to quote the original:
"Presents brought to so-and-so [ a high-ranking personality] so that he
may speak to the Qadi," or Muslim judge-we read that they were
given in the convenient form of cash-20 dinars-accompanied by an
unspecified quantity of grain. 6 The Jewish community officials were
remunerated in a similar way. Payments by the more affluent members
of the community for the distribution of loaves to the needy were also
made in wheat. 7 Furthermore, grain was given on loan "like dinars," as
we know not only from Jewish and Muslim lawbooks, but from Geniza
letters, for example, from eleventh-century Jerusalem.8 All this shows
that people tried to be as close as possible to "the source of
life"-bread was called :'life," 'aysh, in the local vernacular of Egypt
even in the eleventh century.'
 A village was designated by the same word, q,ay'a, as a farm, which
was natural, for often a whole village belonged to a single lord. The
Mediterranean village, as far as we are able to know through the Geniza
 papers, was entirely different from the middle and western European
manor, where its lord had complete economic control and outrageous
 prerogatives, in addition to his political authority and far-reaching
 juridical power. The <jay'a was similar to the European manor insofar
 as its peasants were in many respects the heirs of the Roman coloni,
that is, legally free men, who were enslaved to the soil that they worked







and to its proprietor. But south and east of the Mediterranean the state
remained in control in all respects, economic, political, and juridical,
the lord being the beneficiary rather than the master of the village. In
a letter written in Arabic characters, presumably by a Muslim, the
writer described the bearer as "one of the fellahin of my brother," re-
ferring to the still-existent village of Kalbasha. This phrase should not
be understood as implying that the messenger stood in a state of ser-
vitude to the man who had leased the place from the government or
received it as a fief. 10
The village, like the town, formed a rather open society. Jewish
immigrants from Spain could settle in a q.ay'a near Jerusalem in the
middle of the eleventh century and operate a store there.11 At approx-
imately the same time, lac, an Oriental varnish used in industry, but
not in agriculture, could be sold in four different villages in Egypt.12
A <;lay'a might be large enough to have its own nii'ib, or Muslim deputy
judge, or deputy police superintendent.13 From one of those four
Egyptian villages, .a beautiful Aramaic document, dated 1083, has been
preserved, the writer of which must have been a scholarly man.u To
another of those villages a Hebrew Jetter was addressed from Jerusalem
around 1040, the understanding of which likewise required an expert
knowledge in a language not normally used in daily conversation.15
Letters from the countryside would deal with the universal topics of
the state of crops or, in a country like Palestine, of the rain, the prices
and diseases of cattle, consignments and presents sent to town. In
Egypt they would write in particular about wheat, flax and chickens,
but also about many minor agricultural products.111 We hear about an
act of robbery committed "near our village" (in the Fayyiim), or read
complaints about an oppressive tax-farmer who had sold the petitioner's
fruit trees and had already earmarked some of his date palms, or in
another case, a most lively dispute between an angry proprietor and a
manager quick at repartee, defending himself against the reproach of
negligence, for instance, with regard to rapacious Bedouins. A manager
of a farm far away from the capital would remind the absentee landlord
to replenish his stock of bees, and, naturally, many orders and queries
about prices went from the countryside to the town, and vice versa.17
The contrast between town and country would find its expression in
popular stories about the Mi~ri, or citizen of the capital, and the Rifi,
preserved in the Geniza, or a man would write in a letter: "I feel myself
in relation to you like a fellah honored by a most illustrious lord of a
gay'a," enlarging upon the topic in detail.18 The term Rif for country-
side and smaller towns as opposed to the capital and other cities was
also used in Palestine.19
Wheat was the main grain for human consumption. Its cultivation,
prices, and ways of preparation are discussed in Mediterranean So-
ciety, Volume III, chapter viii. Barley served as bread for the very
poor, but was normally needed to feed riding beasts (and probably also







 for various kinds of beer mentioned in our records; the mizr beer,
according to Maqrizi, was made from wheat). As we may conclude
from the quantities ordered by a scholar from a village, it was laid in
in stores like wheat. 20 In Palestine it is referred to as grown in the
district of Ghaza, a region known also in this century for the quality of
its barley. 21
 The cultivation and use of rice in the medieval Near East has
recently formed the subject of an excellent study. 22 Therefore, it is
perhaps appropriate to list here some details about the subject gleaned
from the Geniza records. We find a consignment of rice going to Palermo
in Sicily where it arrived, and one to Susa in Tunisia where it was
destroyed by enemy action-unfortunately it is not stated whether it
was sent from Egypt or the Syro-Palestinian coast. 23 From Tripoli,
Lebanon, a small quantity, obviously destined for home consumption
and not for trade, went to Alexandria in times of scarcity. 24 In 1045-
1046, a Tunisian merchant on his way to Old Cairo bought rice in
Abii Sir at a price of 18 dirhems, for which he had to pay 2 dirhems
toll when he entered the capital. This is an indication of the cultivation
of this cereal in the Nile Delta over two hundred years before it is
attested in literary sources. 25 In Old Cairo itself there existed a "House
of Rice," that is, a storehouse and bourse for the sale of rice, which was
situated in the neighborhood of buildings belonging to a Muslim judge,
a Christian innkeeper, and two Jewish ladies near the great thorough-
fare of the bazaar of the oil-makers. 26 So far, however, not a single
 razziiz, or rice merchant, has been found in the Geniza, while H. J.
 Cohen's Ph.D. dissertation mentioned above enumerates twenty of
 them, mainly for Iraq, as against only thirteen ~annat's or dealers in
 wheat.
 Since biblical times, Egypt has been famous for its vegetables and
 greens, and the Jews for their predilection for this type of food. (For
 ancient Fez, R. Le Tourneau quotes the curious note that the Jewish
 infatuation for vegetables was a sufficient reason for the Muslims not to
 like them.) In the Geniza period too, vegetables formed a conspicuous
 part of the daily diet, and different types of greengrocers and vegetable
 sellers are mentioned repeatedly in our documents. The Geniza has also
 preserved a document in Arabic characters from July, 1103, in which
 two Christians in Alexandria lease from a Muslim two-thirds of his
 mabqala, or vegetable garden, for the duration of a year. The garden
 was situated at the outskirts of the city and was bordered by two
 vineyards, an irrigation channel, and the Khalij, the great canal that
 connected the Mediterranean port with the Nile. The two Christians
 promised t-0 use the site only for the growing of vegetables and greens
 and to pay a yearly rent of 6 dinars. They were permitted the use of
 a well, a wooden irrigation wheel, and a shack (proudly called qa~r,
 castle; the English word has the same Latin origin as the Arabic term,
 which appears in the sense of a primitive farm building also in papyri







from earlier centuries). This document is of considerable interest
inasmuch as it shows that an agricultural contract was made on the
same lines as those known for industry and commerce. The lease is for a
short period, one year, although one would expect that the needs of
preservation and amelioration of the soil were conducive to longer
contracts. Payment was made not at the beginning, but after the lapse
of a certain period, as was the general usage in contracts of rent. 21
 As a rule, vegetables appear in the Geniza at the consumer's end
rather than at the producer's and are therefore treated under Food in
Mediterranean Society, Volume IV, chapter ix. The same applies to
plants used for seasoning and as spices. The industrial crops, in particu-
lar flax and silk, have been dealt with in the preceding section.
 Next to wheat, the nutrition of the common people depended mainly
on oil, obtained either from plants or from the olive tree. As oil, to-
gether with wax, was also the almost exclusive material for artificial
lighting, its importance can be easily gauged. Because of the enormous
extent of flax-growing, linseed oil was widely used, in particular for
lighting. It was exported from Egypt to olive-growing Syria and to far-
away Aden in South Arabia. 28 Edible oil was won to a large extent from
the sesame plant, which was grown in the Nile Delta, in particular its
northern parts, and in Palestine. "Maker of sesame oil" as a name or
an occupation occurs frequently in the Geniza records, while "sesamist,11
dealer in this crop, is rare. 211 The dyeing plant sallower (the English
word is derived from Arabic 'a~fur, which designates its flowers) or
rather its seed ( called qurtum, cf. the scientific name carthamus) also
provides an oil, used mainly for medical purposes. In the Geniza, we
find the seed sent from a village to the capital, while the red dye made
from the flowers, which was used widely in cosmetics, was a common
article in the international trade of coloring stuffs. 30
 The noble olive tree, in the Bible (Judges 9:8) regarded as the king
of all trees, is indigenous to the Mediterranean area, but almost en-
tirely absent from Egypt. Olive oil, however, was a vital ingredient in
the daily food of the population and also provided the choicest light-
ing. No wonder, then, that its import to Egypt was one of the great
branches of the Mediterranean trade. Still, it was partly processed also
in the country. In a document made out in Tunisia in 1074, a woman
claimed " [olive] oil makers' equipment" in Old Cairo which belonged
to her, and in 1203, a man called baddi, operator or proprietor of an oil
press, appears as a party to a contract in the same town:31 Zayyiit,
maker or seller of olive oil, is one of the most common names or
occupations mentioned in our papers, and repeated reference has been
made here to a bazaar named after that profession. In an olive-growing
country like Spain, it was of course natural that the lending of an
object like a stone used in the oil press should form the object of a
contract (Lucena, before 1021) .32
 In Egypt, by far the most important local fruit was the date, and we







 have already seen the writer of a Geniza letter expressing concern
 about the fate of his date palms. 33 Occasionally we also hear about
 wholesale trade in dates. Today, about thirty different sorts are on the
 market in Egypt. In a Geniza paper of 1143, one sort bore the name
 Ya'qiib (Jacob).34 Fig trees also must have been very common in
 Egypt, although in the Geniza we read rather frequently about the
 import of figs from Lebanon, Syria, and Tunisia. One particularly
 esteemed fig was called fa1iq; but a Mr. Fariqi, whose name was
 derived from this word, was the proprietor of a ship.35
 The sycamore (not to be confounded with the European and Ameri-
 can trees of that name), at home in Egypt since time immemorial and
 once believed to be the seat of Hathor, the goddess of love, was grown
 not only for its figlike fruit, but also for its timber, although both are
 of inferior quality. 36 Carobs, or "St. John's bread," were, as in St.
 John's times, food for the poor, but in periods of famine, an avidly
 sought-after substitute for more valuable carbohydrates. As we find
 them sold in considerable, but not commercial, quantities to a mer-
 chant passing through Alexandria, the dry, sweetish carobs, which
 remain edible for many months, was perhaps an important part of the
 diet of seafarers.87
 Bananas became popular in Europe and in the United States only
 during this century. The markets of Jerusalem and Old Cairo were,
 however, full of them more than nine hundred years ago, and the
 designations banana grower and banana vendor recur in our records
 both as an occupation and as a family name. Melons, of course, were
 grown everywhere around the Mediterranean. In towns, they may have
 not been so easily obtainable. In one letter, an aunt, in order to make
 her invitation to her village more attractive for her little nephew,
 promises him that he would have plenty of watermelons to eat.38
 Most impressive are the many references in the Geniza to the import
 to Egypt of nuts and fruits, such as almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts,
 pistachios, peaches, and prunes.39 Perhaps the great influx of immi-
 grants from Palestine, Syria, and Iran, where these fruits grow, had
 something to do with this development in taste and eating habits. The
 sellers of dried fruit had a bazaar of their own in Old Cairo, and
 persons described as such are mentioned in our papers.4° An "apple
 man" has so far made his appearance only in Palestine, a country
 renowned for its apples all over the Near East before it was laid
 waste.41
 The growing of citrus fruit, in our days one of the most lucrative
 branches of Mediterranean agriculture, was of very limited scope in
 the period considered here. Lemon juice was traded in considerable
 quantities.4 2 Otherwise, we read in the Geniza papers only of the citrus
 medica, utrujj in Arabic, etrog in Hebrew, as its scientific name indi-
 cates, used in medicine, but also made into delicious preserves.43 The
 technique of grafting of different species of citrus was already prac-







 tised in that time, as is known, for example, from the writings of Ibn
 Jumay', a Jewish doctor contemporary with Maimonides.44
The bustiins, or orchards, sometimes comprised not only fruit trees,
 but also trees of shade, planted for the pleasure of the visitors. In a
 document from Damascus, an orchard in a nearby viJlage, which was
 made a pious foundation for the benefit of the local scholars, contained,
 besides fruit trees, such as pomegranates, Greek, or black, and Persian,
 or white, poplars, cypresses, and willows.45 One-half of "a house in an
 orchard" was let in Old Cairo for 25 dirhems a month on condition that
 the tenant took care of the irrigation, for which he was allowed to
 make a monthly deduction of 5 dirhems. The proprietor himself contin-
 ued to live in the house, as his father had done before him. Thus, it is
 likely that the orchard contained decorative in addition to fruit-
 bearing trees.46 When we read that in Sicily a man bought from a
 Christian "gardens and a house" for one hundred mithqa.ls, the agricul-
 tural land was perhaps the main object of the transaction.47
We have just had an example of an orchard donated to the commu-
 nity as a pious foundation. This must have been a rather common
 practice, as several legal deeds connected with it have been preserved.
 In one case,, such a bustii.n is leased for the duration of eight years
 against a payment of 11 dinars and the obligation to deliver every year
 one thousand palm branches and to transport them to the Nile. (These
 branches perhaps were destined for use on the Jewish Feast of Taber-
 nacles, cf. the Christian Palm Sunday.) Moreover, the tenant under-
 took to operate the irrigation wheel continuously (i.e., whenever
 needed) with oxen and to cut nothing planted in the orchard except
 when this would be conducive to its health. 411 In another deed, a piece of
 land that comprised a well with perennial water, but was in a neglected
 state, was leased for the nominal price of 6 dirhems a year for a period
 of thirty years, on condition that the leaseholder or his heirs revived
 the land and installed an irrigation wheel.49 "The orchard of the
 synagogue of the Palestinians" in Old Cairo most probably was a piece
 of land adjoining the building itself, as still was the case in the 1880's.
 This was not leased out, but the fruits were sold yearly in one Jump, in
 1161-1162 for 12 dinars. An autograph instruction by Maimonides
 concerning a communal orchard which was leased to a Muslim does not
 refer to this bustan, but to a piece of ground outside the city. Jewish
 persons called bustiini, gardener, are mentioned in the Geniza. One,
 who received clothing from the community, perhaps worked in a com-
 munal orchard.BO
 As is well known, Muslims are not supposed to drink wine or any
 other alcoholic beverage. In our period, however, a certain laxity
 prevailed. A contemporaneous Muslim visitor to the Egyptian capital
 remarked that hardly any fresh grapes could be had there, because
 most of the grapes available in the countryside were made into wine.
 Unlike the more strict Muslim West, in Egypt vessels containing wine







were openly displayed for sale. 51 This report tallies with the evidence
to be gained from the Geniza papers. The huge sales of wine referred to
could hardly have been destined for the Christian and Jewish popula-
tion alone, especially as many people, and certainly not only Jews,
used to buy grapes and have them pressed and made into wine for
home consumption (see below).
 Unlike orchards, vineyards, as fields-in one document, wine-
growing areas are indeed designated as "fields"-were legally the prop-
erty of the government or its amirs. Therefore, a karram, or "wine-
grower," is not to be regarded as a proprietor of vineyards, but as one
who leased them from the government and took care of them. Of cases
like this we read in our papers, for example, about an exquisite vine-
yard belonging to, or being under the jurisdiction of, the governor of
Alexandria, which the writer of the letter had for years tried in vain to
lease. For this purpose a letter of recommendation had been sent to the
governor from influential people in the capital.52 In Spain, the legal
situation was different. The Hebrew documents or formularies that
have reached the Geniza from there show that private persons pos-
 sessed vineyards and sold or leased them at liberty. Of particular
 interest is one deed of sale of half a vineyard, which, after having
detailed all the legal aspects of the transaction in most elaborate
 Hebrew, enumerates in Arabic, 11 in the terminology in vogue in Muslim
courts," no fewer than fifteen defects and diseases that the vineyard
 might have and in which the buyer was prepared to acquiesce.53 An-
 other document from Spain, a formulary, shows how minutely the
 obligations of a tenant were fixed, including the exact number of loads
 of manure to be used; he had to look after everything, from the
 amelioration of the soil and of the stock of the vines to the pressing of
 the grapes.M
 Since wine has in Jewish religion a strongly sacramental character,
 its preparation had to be done by Jews. 55 Therefore it is not surprising
 to find persons designated as "pressers (of grapes)," although this can
 have been only a seasonal occupation.ss Pressers of grapes were needed
 in general, as were millers. For just as people bought wheat and sent it
 to the miller for grinding (instead of buying flour), thus they bought
 grapes and had them pressed (instead of buying wine). "In case I shall
 be late and not be able to come home in time," writes a government
 official to his family in Old Cairo, "please buy the grapes and have
 them pressed. By God, the purchase of the grapes and the wheat is my
 most urgent request of you." Such inquiries about the pressing of wine
 or reports that the wine has been made and "put into the sun" are quite
 common in letters written in the months of August and September.
 Smaller quantities might have been pressed at home. Thus, a scholar
 asks a friend in a village to send him two pliable, handleless baskets
 for pressing grapes. Handpressing of grapes (in linen cloth) was done
 in Palestine even in this century.GT In addition to homemade wine, one







 bought the much-consumed beverage at the expert wineseller and, as
 we do, also imported wine from Europe.
In view of the prominence in the Geniza of the production of wine,
 one is astonished to find in it no mention of that of vinegar, especially
 as vinegar was used very much in the preparation of food and bever-
 ages. A khalliil, or vinegar-maker, sold flax and was a Muslim. One
 half of the "Vinegar House" in Fustat (not mentioned by the Muslim
 geographers) was the property of the Jewish community.58
As for stock farming, we have to bear in mind that, owing to the
 difficulties of transport and preservation, a certain number of cattle
 had to be kept inside a large city in order to provide it with fresh milk.
 We repeatedly find reference in our documents to zariba's, or enclo-
 sures for domestic animals, for example, in the Tujib quarter of Old'
 Cairo.59 Whether the frequently mentioned "milkmen" tended these
 animals, or were solely occupied with the marketing of milk, is not
 evident from our papers.60 Since the decalogue prescribes that not only
 man, but domestic animals as well, should do no work on the Sabbath
(Exodus 20:10), and, as in our period such commandments were taken
 very literally, Jews had great difficulties with their cattle-breeding.
 One man, we read, defends himself against the insinuation that he
 hired out his oxen on Saturday to Muslims to draw their irrigation
 wheels. Another describes how he gave to his sheep beans before
 sending them out for grazing so that they should not graze on the
 Sabbath in the same way as they did on workdays. Delivering fresh
 milk on Saturday, of course, was out of the question, as no profit was
 allowed on Sabbath; however, even its keeping for cheese-making met
 with religious scruµles. 61 In order to avoid these difficulties, one shared
 one's cattle with Muslims, in a form of partnership in which one
partner was the proprietor and the other did the work, a common form
 of capital investment in those times.62 A pair of oxen cost in the middle
of the tenth century 15 "large" dinars, a high sum, for which one could
have a modest house in a town. The price is not described as exorbi-
tant.03
 Cheese-making looms very large in the Geniza records. A district
near Damietta, in Lower Egypt, which according to one Muslim geog-
rapher had the best sheep in the world, was also a great center of this
industry, and others are also mentioned.M Nevertheless, the local pro-
duction was not sufficient and we read much about imports from Sicily,
Crete, and Asia Minor (see above, p. 46), as well as from Palestine.•
For the preparation of cheese, rennets, the membrane of the stomach of
a calf, were used, and special sorts of cheese are mentioned.• Butter,
zubda, was another dairy product in common use (a creamy substance,
different from ours) and its producers formed a special group, which,
however, was not as prominent as the cheese-makers...,
 A middle-class weekend without chicken was unthinkable. Therefore
it is not surprising to find that dajiiji, seller of chickens, occurs fre-







quently in the Geniza papers, both as occupation and family name.68
There were also special poultry farmers. A qunn, or coop with chicken,
or several coops, would be sent to friends in the city. A scholar living in
a small town would keep a poultry yard. Of course, we hear about this
only because a number of his chickens perished in a disease.69
 The demand for honey and wax was many times greater in the
Middle Ages than in our ~wn time. Consequently, the trade in these
two commodities and beekeeping itself are very conspicuous in the
Geniza papers. It is also possible, but by no means sure, that in this
field the Jews had a proportionally higher share than the rest of the
population because Palestine was a country with a long tradition of
beekeeping and, in this period, still exported honey and wax. 70 In
addition to the beekeeper, there were specialists in scraping the honey
from the combs and in particular "the honey men," most probably
occupied mainly with the selling of the product. 71 Some Geniza docu-
ments deal especially with beekeeping. At the death of an apiarist,
three hundred "undamaged" beehives and one thousand pounds of
honey were found in his possession. 72 From another letter we learn that
exhausted swarms of bees had to be either disposed of, or replenished
by the end of January, and that fifty beehives, to be purchased for this
purpose, cost the considerable sum of 20 dinars. 73 Just as the Egyptian
Nagid, according to the letter mentioned, possessed an apiary in a
place far away from the capital, thus we find, four hundred and fifty
years later, a prominent scholar in Safad, Palestine, keeping bees in
Galilean villages and transporting his honey from there to the provin-
 cial capital.74 A "honey" of inferior quality was extracted from the
sugar cane, and the readers of The Arabian Nights (Night no. 990) are
 familiar with the tragicomedy of the cobbler whose marriage fell to
pieces because he brought home sugarcane honey, instead of bee honey;
in a Geniza letter to Damietta an order is given for honey, "but solely
from bees." 15
 Egypt produced its own honey, and one of the major provincial
towns was called, also in a Geniza document, dated 1244, "Honey
 [-producing] Benha. 11 From another town, we read, "two pots with
 honeycombs" were sent to the capital.16 There was also a very con-
siderable import of honey, not only from Palestine, but also from
 Tunisia, and wax was one of the staple goods coming from that
 country. Wax-maker, shamma', was one of the most common Jewish
 family names. 71
 Along the same routes upon which honey and wax went from the
Muslim West and the Syro-Palestinian coast through Alexandria or
 Damietta to the Egyptian capital, Old Cairene sugar was shipped in
 regular and very large consignments in the opposite direction. From
 Muslim descriptions of Old Cairo it was already evident that sugar
 production must have been one of the major, if not the greatest,
 industry in that town during the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods, and







 from the same sources it appears also that the share of the Jews in this
 field was very extensive.78 Sukkari, or maker (and seller) of sugar, is
 indeed one of the most common occupations and family names occur-
 ring in the Geniza, from the beginning of the eleventh to the end of the
 thirteenth centuries. Nor was this confined to Old Cairo. A representa-
 tive of the merchants in Qayrawan, Tunisia, was called Ibn al-Sukkari
 around 1030, and a scholar from Denia, Spain, who went to Baghdad
 around 1070 and became the head of the Jewish Academy there, bore
 the same family name. 78 We read about a "sugar kitchen" in Minyat
 Zifta in the eastern Nile Delta, which was leased for 8 dinars during
 two years and brought a profit of 45 dinars per year.80 The qandiyya,
 or producers of candy sugar, were a group by themselves, referred to
 several times.81
 The sums just mentioned are of course modest. But we have already
 seen, page 81, above, that in the contracts for industrial partnership
 by far the biggest capital was invested in sugar factories. In a death-
 bed declaration a man leaves instructions for the payment of the very
 large debt of 238 dinars out of the sale of his sugar which was stored
 with his partner, leaving the rest to his son.82 Mostly, the sugar
 fabricants appear in the list of contributors as the wealthier members
 of the community. "Juice of the sugarcane" was the byname of a
 person who obviously was very sweet and pleasant and it also became
 a family name. No references to the cultivation of the sugarcane have
 come to light so far in our records,83 while the references to sugar made
 of raisins are doubtful.
 "We remember the fish which we were wont to eat in Egypt."
 Whether this biblical testimony (Numbers 11:5) is indicative of
 the abundance and excellence of fish in the Nile country or only of the
 predilection of the ancient Israelites for that food, in any case, both the
abundance of and the predilection for fish were still to be encountered
during the Geniza period. A Spanish visitor to Cairo at the time reports
that fish pickles were one of the most common victuals consumed, and
as far as the poorer sections of the population are concerned, a similar
observation was made early in the nineteenth century.84 In Geniza let-
ters we find a glass jar with minced fish pickles going from Alexandria
to Old Cairo and salted tuna fish sent as a present to the same town
from faraway Qayrawan.85 Fishers and fishmongers, also as family
names, are well attested in our papers, and there were specialists, for
example, in tuna fish, called tunni and tawwiin (both the English and
Arab names come from the Greek) 1 in carp pickles, in various other
fishes, especially the popular little salt fishes, and in oysters or shellfish,
malJ,(IJ,)ari.86 Since the mal.).ari had their base in Alexandria and op-
erated on the Syro-Palestinian coast, they were most probably engaged
 in the catching of the precious purple shellfish. Together with dyers
they belonged to the lowest strata of the society and gave much trouble
to the community leaders in Alexandria. One letter speaks with horror







 about Alexandrian shellfishers drinking beer in Crusaders' taverns in
 Acre, Palestine. Across the bay of Acre there is Haifa, the Greek by-
 name of which was still, at the time of the writing of that letter,
 Porphyrion, the town of the purpl~ shell. 81


 6. PROFESSIONS OF WOMEN
The women were the workers par excellence. Each married woman
 was expected to engage in some work in addition to her household
 chores. Therefore, the marriage contracts often stated, whether a wife's
 earnings belonged to her husband (who was under the obligation to
 provide her with all her needs) or whether she would be allowed to
 rebin them, or whether they were to cover her clothing expenses.1
 When a husband went abroad, he would earmark or deposit sums for
 his wife, from which she would pay rent, taxes, and her household
 expenditure, but would stipulate expressly not to lay claim on any
 earnings made by her "through work and spinning." 2 We also read
 complaints about a husband illegally appropriating sums received by
 his wife for her work. 3 A keen observer of life in Egypt at the beginning
 of the nineteenth century remarked that even upper-class women did
 by no means refrain from sending the products of their needle artistry
 to the market for sale.4 A similar situation must have prevailed in our
 period (cf. p. 129, below). In this chapter, however, only special
 -professions exercised by women are considered.
In the first place, there were the professions connected with female
 life itself. A wedding was a great affair, and the elaborate combing and
 dressing of the bride was confided to an expert, the bride-comber, who
 .also was obviously in charge at least of a part of the receptions, as she
 had to employ a laborer for her work. A witty Yemenite proverb points
 to the fact that the bride-comber was the most important person at a
 wedding: "As long as the bride-comber has eaten her fill, the rest of the
 party may remain hungry." It is interesting that in some places, but
not everywhere, Muslim bride-combers were employed in Jewish
 houses. 5 In childbirth, foe young mothers were helped by experienced
 women of her own family, but also by professional midwives. 6 Wet
nurses are rarely mentioned in the Geniza records. It may be noted in
 passing that the oldest Muslim collection of legal opinions contains the
 question whether a Muslim household employing a Jewish wet nurse
 might have its meat prepared by a Jewish ritual slaughterer in order to
 enable her to eat together with the family without religious scruples. A
 similar collection from the thirteenth century reports the case of a
 Jewish woman who nursed a Muslim boy and died leaving a child of
 her own. It was impossible to establish which was the Jewish boy and
 which the Muslim.7
Women doctors appear more frequently in our documents. One fe-







 male oculist is also listed. As those mentioned belonged to the lower
 strata of the society, they certainly had not gone through the expensive
 apprenticeship of scientific medicine, but were practitioners whose
 knowledge and skill had come to them by tradition. I, who have had
 opportunity to admire the quick judgment and the dexterity displayed
 by such a woman doctor in a Yemenite weavers' village, as well as the
 trust put in her by her clients, am inclined to believe that those tabibas
(one is called al-tubayba, "the little [ or beloved] doctor") fulfilled an
 important role in the fem ale society of the Geniza period. A specialist
 for the removal of hair from the bodies of ladies is also ment,ioned. 8
Women teachers are frequently referred to. It stands to reason that
 they taught little girls the female art of embroidery and other needle-
 work, and in one case it is expressly said that the widow of a scholar
 was assigned two orphans to teach them "the craft" of embroidery
 while another person, presumably a male, would instruct them in
 prayer. There.are also cases of women working in schools and giving
 regular instruction in the main subject studied there, namely Bible
 reading. We may be right in assuming that these were exceptions
 rather than the rule. 9 That women should engage in astrology and
 prophesying the future of their clients could be expected in an age
 when such activities were regarded as an ordinary occupation.10
The industries, in particular textiles, were, of course, the main field
 of female remunerative occupations. From the Geniza texts it is not
 evident whether there existed workshops employing groups of women,
 or whether all work was done individually and at home. When a
 husband makes peace with his wife on condition she works at home and
 not out of the house, or when a Persian merchant writes that the
(female) spinners did not produce much of a certain material any
 more, such statements could ref er either to workshops or to private
 homes. We read about a woman unraveling the filament and reeling
 raw silk given to her, which was burnt in her house; another, a
 divorcee, whose whole livelihood consisted in this type of work; about
 a woman leaving equipment for silk-weav3ng to her daughter; or one
 ordering silk to be woven by herself and her sister; or about a commu-
 nity statute forbidding women to dye silk at home, except with the
 permission of the person who had farmed out the government tax for
 the exercise of this craft. 11 Spinning was by no means confined to the
 treatment of local fibers. In addition to silk, of which we have just
 read, we hear about Egyptian flax, sent in raw state to Tunisia and
 spun there by women living on this work. 12
It is not astonishing that we rarely hear of dressmakers. In those
 days, it was the fibers and colors and only secondarily the cut which
 counted; most dresses were simple in form and probably sewn largely
 at home. One embroiderer was rich enough to donate a Torah scroll to
 a synagogue, another, a Muslim, for buying a house worth 400 dinars.
 "Son of the lace-maker" was a family name.13







 The products of female industry were sold by female brokers. While
in Pharaonic times, as Herodotus reports with amazement, women in
Egypt did the selling and buying (while the men were the producers),
the medieval bazaars were normally no place for women's activities.
For this very reason, it was practicab]e to have a fem ale broker who
visited the houses and collected and traded the threads and textiles
made by women (seep. 161, below). Women designated as wak'ila, or
agent, are mentioned in communal lists and referred to in letters (not
always in a laudatory context) .14 Others were named after the com-
modity in which they traded such as the sellers of ambergris perfumes,
or of flour. 15 In one case we read about a man who had inherited from
his father two Hebrew Bible codexes and entrusted a woman broker
with their sale. She offered them "to all the elders of the community"
and when she found no buyer, she f eU upon the good idea of selling
them to her own son for 7-½ dinars, while she herself collected a
brokerage fee in the amount of 1/4 dinar. Six years later, the original
proprietor learned that one codex alone allegedly was worth 20 dinars.
The case was brought to court-and thus to our knowledge.16
 In the preparation of food for sale, women were represented less than
one would expect. We hear of a woman baker, a seller of cooked beans,
and the preparer of a certain sweetmeat (the latter was some kind of
public leader or troublemaker in Alexandria around 1100). Siiqiya,
"female cupbearer" in classical Arabic, cannot have this meaning in
the Geniza society. Since the word appears only in a family name and
in a list, its real meaning cannot yet be made out. Perhaps the saqiya
prepared and sold certain beverages.17
 Just as the readying of the bride for her queenlike role required an
expert, thus the very elaborate apparel, in which the dead, especially
dead women, were buried and the treatment of the body before burial,
were confided to a specialist. (The Yemenites say: "Man enjoys life
only twice: at his marriage and at his death.") She was called "the
washer 111 and since people in these matters cling very tenaciously to
their local customs, it is not surprising to find in one and the same list a
 (female) washer for the Rum, or European, Jewesses (mostly refu-
gees), and another for those of Old Cairo. Wailing, too, was part of the
funeral business and done mostly by women.18
 When E. N. Adler, the famous coJlector of manuscripts, visited
Aleppo, Syria, in 1888, he had opportunity to attend a performance by
Jewish women dancers from Damascus. Only one reference to this
profession has been found so far in the Geniza and even this is doubt-
ful.19
 The most natural of all fem ale remunerative occupations, that of
domestic help, is aJl but absent from the Geniza records. It has already
been stressed that the society described in this book shunned any form
of employment, and as the maidservants doing household work were
legally slaves, it is natural that free women were reluctant to join their







 ranks. Only well-to-do people could afford to keep a slave, however,
 while the need for an at least temporary replacement of the housewife
 must have been a frequent occurrence. The answer to this puzzle is the
 extended family, the fact that married sons used to live with their
 parents and sisters and often also with married brothers in one and the
 same house, so that normally a number of women were at hand in case
 one of them was temporarily incapacitated. The availability in the
 bazaar of freshly cooked food of all descriptions (cf. above, p. 115),
 also was of great practical importance in this respect, and it is not
 excluded that this socioeconomic feature had its origin in the fact that
 families belonging to the lower middle class and the poorer sections of
 the population could not afford to keep a servant.
Free women as domestic help are found only under special circum-
 stances, in particular in the houses of widowed religious dignitaries. In
 his will an old cantor leaves 2 dinars to a woman who had looked after
 him. 20 Another woman, who had done the same for a riiv, or spiritual
 leader of a community, receives clothing from a public charity.21 A
 woman of European origin who had a married daughter herself, writes
 from a1-Mahdiyya to her mother and sister in Alexandria: "I work as
 a servant in any house," complaining about the weakness of her body
 and her old age. In the same letter she mentions that her son had left
 her eight years before and nothing had been heard from him since.
 These circumstances explain why she had to humiliate herself with
 work in other people's houses. She was a foreigner and had no one to
 maintain her. 22 On the occasion of the marriage of her daughter the
 wife of a Kohen is described as serving in the house of a judge.23
Somewhat more befitting a free woman was the service of the com-
 munity by taking care of the cleaning of a synagogue building or a
 school. Both the synagogue of the Palestinians and that of the Iraqis
 in Fustat had a khiidima, the female equivalent of khadim, or beadle.24
 In one case we read about a woman serving in a kuttab, or Bible
 school. 211 These women received bread and clothing, and also payment
 from the community, all of which, however, smacked of charity.•
 Service, under any circumstances, was not a proper way of earning
 one's livelihood in that free-enterprise society of the Geniza world.


 7. SLAVES AND SLAVE GIRLS

In order to be able to understand the economic role and the social
 position of slaves in the society reflected in the Geniza records, we must
 free ourselves entirely of the notions familiar to us from our readings
 about life on American plantations or in ancient Rome. Slavery in the
 period under consideration was neither industrial nor agricultural;
 with the exception of the armies, which were largely composed of
 mercenaries who were legally slaves, it was not collective, but individ-







 ual. It was a personal se1vice in the widest sense of the word, which,
 when the master served was of high rank or wealthy, carried with it
 great economic advantages, as well as social prestige.
In a famous passage in his Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith says: "It
 appears . . . from the experience of all ages and nations ... that the
 work done by free men comes cheaper in the end than that performed
 by slaves." 1 In this general form, this statement does not hold true and
 has been ref utcd by competent historians. It certainly does not apply
 to the period of early Islam, where an abundant supply of captives was
 available in the wake of the incessant wars of conquest, so that free
 men's labor could be replaced by the cheaper work of slaves. As is well
 known, the ninth century, the third of Islam, witnessed a tremendous
 revolt of masses of Negro slaves in southern Iraq, which shook the very
 foundations of the caliphate of Baghdad, and, somewhat later, the
 council of a comparatively small Carmathian community in eastern
 Arabia owned a labor force of tens of thousands of Negroes doing
 agricultural work.
In the Mediterranean area of the eleventh through the thirteenth
 centuries the situation was different. Slaves had to be imported from
 faraway countries and were expensive. If we disregard the armies,
 slaves certainly formed only a small minority of the population, unlike
 the situation in imperial Rome, where, according to views widely held,
 three-quarters of the inhabitants were either slaves or freedmen. 2 His
 high value protected the slave and made him an object of considera-
 tion, in addition to the humanitarian laws and admonitions made in his
 favor by the three monotheistic religions.
The very word "slave," 'abd, which at that time had already acquired
 the connotation of Negro,8 was felt as being improper and was replaced
 by circumscriptions such as "boy" and "young man." As the same
 words were applied to free employees, it is sometimes difficult to decide
 whether a person referred to in a Geniza letter was a slave or not, in
 particular in the case of persons serving as business agents. The situa-
 tion is still more complicated by the fact that a freedman too might be
 called "young man of so-and-so," even if his former proprietor had
 died long before.4 Slaves engaged mainly in household work were called
 wafif, "servant," a word that, it seems, was restricted to unfree persons
 and, therefore again was exchanged for another root, namely, khadam,
 which was normally applied to the service of rulers or that of a. com-
 munity. Female slaves, too, were never designated with the Arabic term
 having this meaning, but by jariya, "girl." As this word, too, became
 almost synonymous with slave, it was in its turn often replaced by
 wa[Jifa, "servant." Female slaves, as a rule, bore proper names indica-
 tive of their social station, while male slaves, especially when they
 were business representatives, often had names which were also in use
 among the free population.
The situation of male slaves was essentially different from that of







the females. In Islamic times, the Middle East had become accustomed
to being governed by slaves. The rulers, always distrustful of their own
people, used to surround themselves with persons brought from distant
regionr:;, who knew no other attachment except to their masters, but
who Very often became the masters of their masters. Immediately
before the Fatimid conquest, Egypt was ruled by a black eunuch, an
extremely capable man. The Fatimids and Ayyubids made copious use
of European, Turkish, and other slaves for the highest posts of confi-
dence, and, under their successors, the Mamluks, what had been a
practice became a principle: The ruling oligarchy admitted to its ranks
solely persons who had been slaves.
 On a small scale, we find a similar situation in the life of the
bourgeoisie reflected in the Geniza records. Male slaves were mainly
employed in positions of trust. Rarely do we read about male menials,
as when a man, on his deathbed, after having distributed his possessions,
orders the sale of his riding beast and his wa~if (in this sequence) in
order to pay the burial expenses with their price.5 In a letter from Acre,
shortly after it waa taken by the Crusaders in 1104, a merchant de-
scribes to his mother the terrors of the war, as well as the usefulness of
his servant in such a situation: "I arrived in Palestine before Acre
was taken and thus witnessed the vicissitudes of the siege. We con-
stantly faced danger of death, for we were near to them [the Crusaders]
day and night, hearing their talk and they heard ours, and our bread
was colored with blood. . . . Mubarak [the slave] sends you his regards.
I have no other help besides him. He saved me 10 dirhems a month-
may God keep him. He is the groom, he takes care of the bedding, he is
the cook, he does the washing and he looks after my wardrobe." Clearly,
savings of 10 dirhems a month on service interested the old lady more
than additional details about the war. 6
 The acquisition of a male slave was a great affair, on which a man
was congratulated almost as if a son had been born to him.' No
wonder, for a slave fulfilled tasks similar tlo those of a son. He man-
aged the affairs of his master, he traveled with him or for him, or he
was in charge of his master's business, when the latter himself was out
of town. The ghulam, or "young man," of a businessman would be
consulted in all affairs of his master, and his movements would be
reported in the same way as those of other important merchants.
"Muslim acquaintances who arrived from Ascalon," writes a Palestin-
ian living in Bilbays on the caravan route between Palestine and
Cairo, "told me that Abu '1-Muna, the ghulam of our lord [the head of
the Jews in the Fa.timid empire} has arrived in Ascalon." Similar
statements appear frequently, and, at least in letters referring to the
India trade, a trusted slave is repeatedly referred to with the title "the
elder." 8 When a slave accompanied his master on his travels, we find
that letters would be confided to both.9
The following account well exemplifies the dualism in the social posi-







tion of a ghulam. Its scene was 'Aydhab, the great port on the East
African coast, which served as the terminal for ships coming from
South Arabia, India, East Africa, and China. In December, 1141, there
arrived among the Jewish merchants of Egypt and the Maghreb re-
turning from India, $afi, "the pure, sincere," the slave and agent of the
head of the Jewish academy in Old Cairo, and one Ibn Jamahir, a
notable, well known to us as a troublemaker from other papers relevant
to the India trade. $afi insulted the notable in the presence of Muslim
fellow merchants, accusing him of having disposed of a slave girl, after
having had a child by her, in Berbera on the African coast. !bu Jamahir
filed a complaint of slander against him with the governor of the town.
The governor, well aware of the special status of $afi, tried to consult
the Jewish merchants staying in the town, most of whom, however,
disregarded his invitation. After lbn Jamahir's Muslim friends had
given witness, the governor ordered Safi to be flogged. "What!" ex-
claimed $afi, "I, the ghulain of the Head of the Academy, should be
flogged?" His protest was of no avail, for he was flogged and jailed.
One of the Jewish merchants from the Maghreb intervened, and Safi
was set free-"not without loss of money," whether for himself or his
liberator, is not stated. The document, from which we learn about all
this, was written, of course, because the affair was to have a legal after-
math before the Jewish court in Old Cairo.10
 The agents who were legally slaves were allowed to do business on
their own account, and some must have done very well. One document
shows Durri ("gem"), the ghulam of a Nagid, making one of the largest
contributions to a public appeal, comparable to those of upper middle
class people. In another document, dated 1161, a ghulam (also bearing
the name $afi) gives 2 dinars to the widow of the partner of his master,
while "the young man" of the tax-farmer of the market of Palermo
contracted in 1063 a partnership with a Jewish merchant which involved
very high sums.11 One ghulam, called Tahir ("pure"), was even the
proprietor of a boat. 12 Sometimes a master would do a service for his
own servant, as when a Tunisian merchant ordered old silver for himself
and also for his ghulam Jurj (the same word as modern George)-for
the latter to the notable amount of 27 dinars. 13
 While deeds of sale, gift, or bequest of slave girls have been found in
considerable number among the Geniza records, only one such docu-
 ment has come to my attention so far with regard to adult males (there
 are some for minors). In it, the Indian servant Patan Patana is sold in
 Fustat by a perfumer to a banker for 19-½ dinars (June, 1194). In the
 India trade, of course, the local agents, who were legally slaves, and
whose reliability has already been praised by the Muslim writer al-Jahiz
 (d. 869), were indispensable.14 So far only one deed of manumission of~
 male slave has been found (as against, at least, six, for females), while
the emancipation of slaves must have been extremely common-as we
 may conclude from the fact that freedmen are mentioned so often. It







 should be noted that the act of manumission had to be made before a
 Jewish court, for it converted the slave into a person with all the re-
 ligious duties of a Jew and enabled him to marry a Jewish wife. The
 scarcity of legal deeds with regard to adult male slaves-as opposed
 to the frequent reference to them in letters-might partly have had its
 cause in the fact that, as a rule, they were owned only by members of
 the upper class, which, having its seat in (New) Cairo, is not fully
 represented in the Geniza records. It is also possible that there were
 certain restrictions with regard to transactions in adult male slaves
 which necessitated that they should be made before a Muslim court.
Slave girls as domestic help and nurses of children were found in
 every well-to-do family. With regard to their position, there was, of
 course, a deep cleavage between the Christian and Jewish minorities on
 the one hand and the Muslim majority on lhe other. While Christian-
 ity and Judaism disapproved of any sexual relations outside wedlock,
 in Islam a female slave was at the disposal of her master, and he could
 possess as many of them as he liked and his purse allowed. We should
 not judge this institution too harshly. In a polygamous society, it had
 certain advantages-for all parties concerned-over marriage with
 several free wives enjoying equal rights. Al-Jabarti, an excellent Mus-
 lim historian (writing in the early decades of the nineteenth century)
 praised his old mother for buying a beautiful slave girl for his father
 with her own money; he regarded this as an act of particular piety. It
 was the Judeo-Christian attitude that appeared strange and abnormal
 to a keen Muslim observer. 15 Judaism, in particular, regarded inter-
 course with a slave girl as a very great sin, punishable according to
 some authorities, wit.h death, to be inflicted by zealots (based on the
 biblical story Numbers 25:6-12). A man was not allowed to be under
 one roof with a female slave, unless his mother, sister, or wife lived in
 the same house. Transgressions were punished by forced sale of the
 slave, the price to be distributed among the poor, or by outright
 excommunication.16 We see indeed that an old man who had no one to
 take ca::-e of him had to apply to the "mercy" of the court for permis-
 sion to buy a maidservant. Free domestic help, we remember, was
 difficult to be had. 17
It is only natural that the social habits of a majority should affect
 minorities living among it, and the state of utmost dependence, in which
 slave girls were found, constituted in itself a great temptation. The
 attractive slave was the easy prey of her master's lust also in Roman
 Christian society.18 No wonder that we find occasional references to
 such occurrences also in the Geniza records. We have alreadv heard
 about the India merchant who was accused of having kept a sl~ve con-
 cubine and having had a child by her. In a query submitted to Abraham
 Maimonides we read about a married man with children who forsook
 his fe.mily in his native Alexandria, acquired a slave girl in Old Cairo,







bought her beautiful dresses, the like of which his wife had never had,
and made off with her to the faraway Fayyiim province.19 An official
addressing the same dignitary reports about another man from Alex-
andria, a Kohen, who had left his newly wed wife and taken a Christian
slave girl with him to a village in the Bul)ayra province, the taxes of
which he had farmed. A ban had already been pronounced against him.20
There are a few queries and references to similar and perhaps identical
cases,21 but it seems that, in this respect, the society reflected in the
Geniza records differed markedly from that of the Jews in Spain during
the thirteenth century, when slave concubinage became a blatant social
evil.
 One differentiated between domestics for personal service, those doing
household work in general, and nurses. A rich bride took with her to her
new home two maids, j ariya, and two servants, wa~ifa, the total value
of whom was estimated as being 100 dinars. 22 A respectable merchant
in Alexandria, whose wife had died recently, writes to his friend in Old
Cairo that he had none to serve him and "to hand a cup of water" to
bis children or to himself. No help could be found in the Jewish quarter
of his town, therefore, he asked the addressee to buy him a chaste slave
woman, who would be able to take care of the children.23 We find a
similar request made by another Alexandrian in a letter to his brother
in Old Cairo and by a man in the latter town writing to his father on
travel in one of the countries of the Indian Ocean.24 In a better house
there would be a diida (cf. English dad for father), or nurse, for the
 children, and a wa~ifa, who did the rougher work. A woman on her
deathbed forbids the sale of the Sudanese dada and her little son, be-
 C'ause her own little daughter was so fond of them, and, in order to
emphasize her wi11, even pronounced a curse on any one who would
dare to sell them. 25 A widower confides his three children (not so small,
because he also pays tuition for them) to a family together with their
Nubian nurse "Kinky." In the lengthy document confirming that the
father has made all the payments due from him, the family certifies
that the slave was his property.29
 It is not impossible that humane and proselytizing tendencies were
also active in the acquisition and upbringing of slave girls. Thus, the
wife of a scholar and judge frees on her deathbed her two slaves, who
were virgins, and, it seems, mere children, and provides them with
housing and hoard for life on condition they remained inside the
Jewish fold. 27 One of the girls, called Dhahab, "Gold," had been given
by a widow to her brother a few years earlier when she was only three
years old.28 We find repeatedly that people were eager to acquire slave
girls of tender age. A trader sends to his wife from India a "maid" six
ye~rs old.29 A woman from Fustat asks a relative, a government official
in al-Bahnasi in Middle Egypt, to buy for her "a black, freshly
imported girl, 5-6 years old." 80 This acquisition of maidservants at a







time when they were mere children was done in order to give those
future members of the household a certain measure of practical and
also of religious education.
 The religious position of slaves is a very interesting topic indeed. In
this respect, the three monotheistic religions varied widely. In Judaism,
both male and female slaves were obliged to adopt a milder form of
religious observances, including the full keeping of the Sabbath rest
 (which they might not have disliked). As other proselytes, they were
initiated by baptism. According to the law, if a slave refused to be
baptized within one year, he had to be resold. For readers unfamiliar
with the history of rites it may be remarked that baptism in Christianity
is an inheritance from the mother religion. Maimonides ruled that
slaves, once they had accepted baptism, were members of the covenant
of Israel. 31 He was followed in this by his son and successor Abraham,
who states in an autograph responsum that a baptized slave was in
ritual matters more trustworthy than a Karaite. 32 A contract of sale,
written in or around 1159, describes the slave girl, Sayd, "Quarry
 (game)" expressly as a Muslim and this fact cannot have diminished
her value much, for she was sold for 19-½ dinars. 83 Of the Nubian slave
"Success," sold in summer, 1100, her mistress testified: "I believe she
is a Christian," using the Persian word tersii(wiyya), perhaps as a
matter of precaution. 34 In an appearance before a qadi a slave girl first
contended that she was sold as a Muslim in the Sudanese port of
'Aydhab, but later retracted asserting that in her native country she
had already been Jewish, whereupon her case was relegated to a Jewish
court.811
 A similar story is contained in a query sent to Maimonides. A Jewish
bachelor had bought a Christian "beauty" (the technical term for a
prisoner of war chosen as concubine; she probably was brought to
Alexandria by pirates). He converted her and stayed with her in the
house of his father, stepmother, and their three children. "But the
house was vast." Denounced, for under Islamic rule a Christian was
not permitted to convert to any religion but Islam, the girl contended
before the qadi that she was Jewish, the daughter of a Jewess. This
settled the affair as far as Islamic law was concerned. There remained
the question what to do with the case from the point of view of Jewish
religion. Maimonides, in his practical wisdom, decided that the young
man should emancipate his love and then marry her. According to
strict law, this was illegal. For anyone who had lived illicitly with a
woman or was only under such a suspicion was forbidden to marry her
all his life. (This was also Roman law. Our newspapers would go out of
business if this was common law here.) But, Maimonides adds, he
already had given several such decisions in other cases of slave girl
concubines in order to give an opportuni~y to those who wished to
mend their ways and to lead orderly lives. He did so, as he wrote,







relying on a daring maxim of the ancient sages: "Pay regard to God by
disregarding his law." 86
 The material presented here-other examples follow-proves that, in
Fatimid and Ayyubid times, a certain latitude obtained as regards the
religious attachment of slaves. The Islamic injunction that no one
should be converted to any religion except Islam was largely disre-
garded. Many male and female slaves must have been baptized to
Judaism. In addition to the examples cited, this might be inferred from
the many Jewish freedmen and freed women mentioned in the Geniza
records. On the other hand, the Jewish authorities seem not to have
insisted on the enforcement of the law that slaves had to accept
baptism, and marriage with former slave girls who had been, or had
been under the suspicion to have served as, concubines, were not
altogether lacking.
 As to the provenance and price of slaves, naturally we learn little
about males, since only few deeds concerning them have been found in
the Geniza. Female Negroes were rarely employed. Besides the im-
ported black child mentioned, only one has been ascertained, called
"Musk" (see p. 141, below). Musk, in Arabic poetry, often designates
beautiful dark complexion, but, as a name, should not be taken as
describing its bearer as a Negro, since free white females also could be
called thus.37 Only when expressly described thus, should "Musk" be
taken as belonging to the black race.
 We have already read about the Sudanese dada, or nurse; another
Sudanese, nominally worth 30 gold pieces, in fact perhaps only 15, was
given to the daughter of her mistress as part of her marriage portion. 88
The race most favored for household service was the Nubian. The
)Tubian "Salt11 (denoting wittiness and grace) was sold in 1084 for 15
dinars, and another girl of the same provenance, named "Pleasure,"
was acquired by the widow of the merchant and scholar Nahray b.
Nissim for 20 dinars in 1108. Whether the Nubian "Salt" who was sold
in 1100 for 20 dinars is identical with the one just mentioned cannot be
ascertained. In any case, the seller of 1100 was different from the buyer
of 1084.39 "Dexterity," the Nubian, was sold, together with her little
daughter, in 1094 in Fustat to a Mr. Joseph b. Solomon Kohen for 28
dinars, and again in 1105, this time alone and in Cairo by two brothers,
sons of a Mr. Moses Kohen, a high government official, to their sister
for 20 dinars. If indeed the same person is meant, "Dexterity" must
have changed hands between 1094 and 1105, most probably inside the
same family. 40 "Arsenic"-possibl y called so because of her light, sil-
very-white complexion-the Nubian, was given, in 1134 by a husband
to his wife in exchange for the girl she had brought in as part of her
marriage portion. Another slave by the same name was sold in 1152
and a third was presented by a father to his two daughters as a gift in
1182.'1







 Next to Nubians, we hear mostly of Europea.n slave girls. In 1070, a
woman bearing the proud name Sitt al-Riim, "Queen of the Riim," who
had been freed by her master before his death, appeared in person
 before the rabbinical court of Alexandria to appoint an attorney, to
 collect a loan that she had granted. 42 In 1110, "Steadiness," "from the
land of Greece," was emancipated by a physician.43 At approximately
the same time, the writer of an interesting but fragmentary letter
 states to have taken action with regard to a "Frankish" girl.44 The
highest price for a slave noted in the Geniza, 80 dinars, was fix~d for a
Riimiyya, brought into marriage by a bride (who also possessed gold
vessels valued at 300 dinars, a rare item) in January, 995.45 The
"Christian" slave girls, mentioned above as illegal concubines, also
must have been Europeans, as no local citizens could be reduced to
slavery.
 Slaves from India, male and female, were mentioned earlier. "Inac-
cessible," an Indian girl worth 20 dinars formed part of a marriage
portion totaling 183 dinars in the 1120's.46 About thirty years later, in
1157, she was emancipated by her mistress, a lady known from three
other documents and certainly not identical with the one to whom she
was given as a marriage gift.47 Another Indian girl, called "Gazelle,"
was sold in Fustat by one prominent merchant to another.48
 A group of slave girls frequently referred to were those born in
slavery, called muwallada. It is not evident, through the prices men-
tioned or otherwise, that they were preferred to others, although it is
likely that this was the case.49 When, in November, 1175, the physician
Jekuthiel b. Moses sold Fayriiz (Turquoise), who was born in his
house, for only 12 dinars, the price shows that the slave was a mere boy
at that time. 50 The lowest price encountered thus far in a Geniza
document for a slave girl was obtained by the Persian "Perfume," who
was sold for 10-½ dinars, which sum included brokerage and sales
tax. 51 Another Persian was sold for 13 dinars. 52 No general conclusions
should be drawn from these two instances.
 Mothers were normally sold together with their children, even when
the latter had attained an age when they were able, according to the
notions of that pedod, to do service. Thus "Peacock" was sold in 1241
together with her son "The Blessed" for 40 dinars, although the latter
was about ten years old. 53 The same price is given for a maidservant
and her son "Happiness," both forming part of a marriage portion in
an incomplete document, while the price for a mother and son in
another defective deed has not been preserved.~ We have already seen
that in 1094 "Dexterity" was accompanied by a child, but in 1105 she
was not. "Lucky Fellow," an Abyssinian, was sold for 10-¼ dinars,
when he was still a minor, but he was brought to Egypt as a child, not
separated from his mother, while in slavery.115 In a will, a woman states
that a maidservant who had been bought by her with money given to
her by her mother, had a daughter who belonged to the latter. The old







 mother of the dying woman who lived with her in the same house
 intended perhaps to bring up the little girl in the Jewish faith as an act
 of piety. 56 We had a similar case before. In one document, the diary of
 a famous judge, two-year-old "Fidelity" remained in the possession of
 the seUer of her mother "Darling," who herself was born a slave. As the
 buyer paid only 2 out of the price of 34 dinars, while he was supposed
 to pay the rest in monthly installments during two-and-a-half years,
 perhaps buyer and seller lived next door to each other. In any case, the
 separation of mothers and minor children was illegal.57
The general steadiness of prices characteristic for our period applies
 also to slave girls. The standard price was 20 dinars. We already had
 some examples and many more could be adduced. "Wild Rose" was
 sold for this price in 1148 to Moses, "the Nagid designate," son of the
 Nagid Samuel b. Hananiah. 68 An unnamed servant accompanied her
 mistress to her new home forty years later, the marriage contract
 stating expressly that 20 dinars was the real price.611 In the fragment of
 an eleventh-century marriage contract of a woman who had been
 married before, "Prodigality" is estimated as worth 40 dinars. But her
 name should not deceive us. In some places and times it was custom-
 ary, for the greater glory of the bride, to list in her marriage contract
 sums twice as high as they really were, and other details of that
 trousseau suggest that its inventory was drawn up according to that
 custom.60 "Success," and again "Brightness," were sold for 20 dinars,
 the latter in 1226.81 An Abyssinian slave girl with a white speck in her
 left eye was sold in 1280 for 266-½ silver pieces, which, at the ratio of
 gold and silver usual at this time, was the equivalent of 20 dinars.82 It
 goes without saying that, according to the circumstances, other prices
 were obtained. For this, too, we have already had several examples, the
European slave girl costing 80 dinars being most outstanding. Another
 exceptional price, 40-½ 4 dinars, was paid for the wailing woman "Per-
 fume" in summer, 1156. She was a professional and, as such, a source of
income for her proprietor.63 The other prices group around 20 dinars,
with lesser values for girls of inferior quality or young age. We find
slave girls sold for 25, 23, 22, 21, 20-½, 19-½, 19, 18, 17, 16-¾,, 15-½,
15 (three cases; one was called "Queen of the Lovers"), 14-¼, 13, 12,
and even 10-½ dinars. 84 Other prices have appeared above and are
mentioned below. The exceptionally high price of 34 dinars for "Dar-
ling," mentioned in the preceding paragraph was, at least partly, due to
the fact that the buyer did not pay in cash.
 Thus far, the evidence provided by our documents does not allow
us to make any statement as to the frequency with which slaves changed
hands. For even where deeds refer to the same names within a lifetime,
it is by no means sure that these names, strange and unusual as they
may appear to us, belonged to the same person. We already had two
occurrences each of Safi ("Sincere"), "Gold," "Dexterity," "Pleasure,"
"Perfume," 11 Gazelle," and 'lm (inn. 64), and we also find "Musk" and







"Turquoise" at leasi twice, "Happiness" and "Arsenic" three, and "Suc-
cess" four times.65 A "Fidelity" was set free in January, 1181, by three
sisters whose property she was. 86 If she was identical with "Fidelity"
who was two years old in 1141-1142 (cf. p.139, above), she had changed
hands at least once during this period of forty years.
 Sometimes a document states expressly how the slave had come into
the possession of the seller, implying at the same time why he sold her
s,o quickly. A man had bought a maidservant for his daughter. When
the marriage was not realized, he sold her off.81 On June 7, 1156, a
judge notes in his record book that "Incense" was sold for 15-½ dinars,
the sales tax and broker's fees to be paid by the seller; exactly a month
later, she was sold for 17-½ dinars, but the dues were included in that
price; the record states that she was the girl who had changed hands a·
month before. Presumably the first buyer acted only as a middleman.88
In one case, the second sale and its date are entered on the reverse side
of the deed describing the first. An occurrence like this is easily
explained. One of the usual conditions of a marriage contract stipu-
lated that no husband was permitted to retain a maidservant whom his
wife disliked. Thus the quick resale of "Musk"-this was the name of
the girl concerned-might have had its reason in the fact that she did
not get along well with her new mistress.89
 It should be noted that none of the persons involved in the many
transactions mentioned in this chapter seems to have been a profes-
sional slave-trader. The term nowhere appears in the relevant docu-
ments. The first proprietor of "Musk," the girl just mentioned, was a
perfumer, the second a wax-maker and the third a housewife. The same
holds true of all other Geniza documents dealing with the subject. In
the thousands of letters, accounts, and other papers dealing with busi-
ness (with on·e possible exception) I have not found any reference to
the sale of slaves (in the plural) by Jews. Thus, I can only confirm the
opinion expressed by David Neustadt (now: Ayalon) thirty years ago,
that, during the classical Geniza period, the Jews had no share in the
slave trade. 70
 Although all transactions in slaves mentioned in our papers were
made between private persons who most probably knew each other
personally, the contracts usually mention a commission to be paid by
the purchaser to a broker, as well as a sales tax, literally "dues of the
market." This procedure was not only a matter of precaution (one
wanted the slave to be valued by an expert), but an official injunction,
in order to make an evasion of the sales tax impossible.n The purchaser
undertakes to acquiesce in all defects the slave might have, who under
no circumstances might be returned-conditions summarized with the
formula "like the sale of imported slaves." But even in contracts which
contain this formula defects would sometimes be mentioned.721 On his
part, the seller guarantees to protect the buyer against any claims that
may be raised against him with regard to the proprietorship of the







 slave in a.ny court, Jewish or Gentile. 73 In some contracts it is stated
 that the slave had lived for some time in the house of her future
 proprietor (mostly in case the latter was a lady), who had become well
 acquainted with all her apparent or hidden imperfections. 74
These contracts of sale have quite a number of legalistic aspects that
 are well worth studying. From the socioeconomic point of view it is
 remarkable that almost all transactions were made in cash whereas
 normally business was conducted on credit. We had one case of sale on
 credit with a very small down payme:i;i.t (p. 139, above). There, where
 the seller retained a two-year-old child of the sold slave it is highly
 probable that either the buyer lived in his immediate vicinity, as
 surmised above, or that the mother, too, remained in the seller's house
 until the installments-I dinar per month-were fully paid. Such a
 situation is more clearly brought out in a question submitted to Mai-
 monides. A boy was sold for 12-½ dinars, to be paid, as in the previous
 case, in monthly installments of 1 dinar. The seller used to go to the
 buyer's store to receive the monthly payment. One day he found the
 store deserted and no trace of the debtor lcf t. The seller could not wait,
 because he intended to travel to Yemen. Question: Is he permitted to
 take his property, namely the slave for whom payments had already
 been made, or has he to appoint a representative who would coHect the
 still-outstanding installments? This seems to imply that, in principle,
 payments for slaves had to be made in cash, and where credit ,vas
 granted the slave remained at the disposal of the seller. 75
A student of Muslim or Jewish lawbooks is inclined to ridicule the
 amount of casuistry and hairsplitting devoted to the problem of a slave
 belonging to more than one master, or being partly a slave and partly
 free. The Geniza documents and the contemporaneous responsa prove,
 however, that occurrences like these must have been frequent indeed.
 Above we had the cases of a slave freed by three sisters, another sold
 by two brothers, and a third given by a father as a joint gift to his two
 daughters. Such a relationship is well illustrated in this story: half the
 rights on a female black slave called "Musk," which rights a man had
 inherited from his deceased wife, were given by him to his married son;
 the married son's wife who was also his cousin, was given the other half
 by her mother, who had inherited these rights from the girl's grandfa-
 ther. Thus, "Musk" had remained in one family for three generations,
 but had been legally the property of two different persons for an
 extended period. From some indications in the deed concerned it may
 be concluded that the two married sisters (the mothers of the couple to
 whom the maid was given) had lived in one house and actually shared
 the services of the family domestic. 76 It is natural that things did not
 always go smoothly. In a query addressed to Abraham Maimonides we
 find an extremely complicated lawsuit between two sisters concerning a
 slave girl, which was temporarily so]ved by the decision that she
 should serve one sister one month and one the other. The slave ob-







viously did not consent to a decision that gave her in part to a mistress,
who, according to the details mentioned, had no rights to her. After
three days she appeared before a Muslim court, alleged that the new
parttime mistress had beaten her, and then declared her willingness to
embrace Islam. This, of course, had the consequence that the two rival
sisters had to sell her, since, according to strict law a non-Muslim
should not keep a Muslim slave.77
 This incident shows that a slave was not a mere object, but a person
with rights and a will to take her fate into her own hands. Therefore,
deeds of sale state expressly that the slave recognized the right of
proprietorship of her master or mistress. 78 In a will made around 1100,
the testator, who leH a wife and an infant daughter, stipulated that the
maidservant should never be sold, except if she herself wished so.
Clearly, he wanted, on the one hand, to retain the help of a faithful
servant for his little family and, on the other hand, to leave her
freedom of choice.79 In family quarrels about the possession of a slave
girl, the latter did not remain neutral. "I suspend the litigation," writes
a mother from Alexandria to her son in Old Cairo, "until you report to
me the legal opinion of the Rayyis [presumably a judge, or the N agid
himself]. Meanwhile, the slave girl 'Success' went to the wife of your
maternal uncle, your aunt has alienated her from me, until the girl
went over to her." 80 We read above about a slave girl getting rid of an
undesirable mistress by embracing Islam and two others asserting to be
Jewish in a Muslim court. When, in a period of famine, a family
intended to sell the maidservant, she declared that she did not agree to
be sold.81
 With this, we have come to the great question of the treatment of
slaves. One is tempted to quote the paragraph with which Maimonides
concludes the chapter on slavery in his code of law: "It is both pious
and reasonable on the part of a master to be merciful and just towards
his slave, not to overburden him with work and not to cause him grief,
and to let him share all food and drink taken by himself. . . . He
should not humiliate him either by infliction of corporal punishment or
even by words . . . . He should not shout at him . . . but talk to him
quietly and listen to his arguments .... " Similar admonitions could be
quoted from Christian and Muslim sources. But, of course, not all
people were pious and reasonable. As far as our actual informatjon
from the Geniza records is concerned, the male slaves, who normally
acted as business representatives, are referred to in the same way as
respected merchants and, in case they served also as personal facto-
tums, were greeted in letters as other members of the household,
sometimes with the honorable epithet "the elder." 82 When we find a
case (above, p. 133) where such a slave was flogged as a punishment
for alleged defamation, we should not forget that in those times even
viziers were exposed to such public humiliation. As we shall see in the







discussion of the position of the freedmen, there existed a strong family
attachment between the master and his slave.
 Such attachment was even more pronounced in the case of female
slaves. Naturally, no uniformity can be expected in such matters. Still,
some general trends are definitely recognizable. Slave girls were
greeted in family letters and they sent greetings to the relatives of their
masters. 83 This was perhaps not common in more ancient times, for
even the eccentric poet Abu '1-'Ala al-Ma'arri, who wrote many things
that others abhorred to mention, apologizes when extending greetings
to a black slave. 84 A merchant abroad would be reminded by his wife to
bring- home a present also for the maidservant (mercifully, it was
stated what) .85 Just as most excited congratulations were extended at
the acquisition of a male slave (cf. p. 132, above), so we read about
expressions of sympathy at the death of a slave girl. In a Geniza
fonnulary for letters, we find a long model for a letter of condolence at
such an occasion. Despite the Hebrew characters used in the formu-
lary, we may suspect here a Muslim original, where "slave girl" would
be synonymous with concubine. 86 We also have a contemporaneous
poem by the most celebrated Jewish poet and saint, Judah ha-Levi,
written in Alexandria on his pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he
apologizes to a friend for being unable, because of an eye disease, to
express his sympathy in person on the occasion of the demise of his
slave girl. Here, only a family domestic could be meant. Still, after an
appropriate introduction, the poet has the following to say:

You miss a maid in your house,
But, know that Fortune herself is your slave.
She was purchased by your silver,
But princes are bought by your deeds.
Be not too mournful. Regard her as a ransom
For your soul and the souls of all your children.
Regain your poise, abandon apprehensions,
The angels of peace themselves are at your command.

 The tenor of the poem clearly indicates that the death of a maid, like
 that of a close relative, was regarded not only as a loss, but as an ill
 omen foreboding possible future disasters. 87
 A touchstone for the keatment of slaves is the frequency of reports
 or discussions about their running away from their masters. Thus far,
 only a few such instances have been traced in the Geniza papers. In a
 legal document, we read that a husband, before setting out on a
 prolonged journey, left 25 dinars and 5 irdabbs of wheat for his wife,
 her two daughters, and the maidservant. On the reverse side, the
 remark is added that the maid "was lost from the house" even before
 the master left. 88 In the fragment of a deed in which a slave boy was
 sold for only 11 dinars, the seller, albeit not accepting responsibility for







 his defects, noted that he had run away several times (and also that he
 had committed a theft; this gem of a servant was called "Sandal,"
 Snndalwood) .89 A special case is a letter written in the IOG0's, when
 Bedouins conquered the Egyptian capital, and many slaves (the histo-
 rians say: slave girls) took advantage of the opportunity to nm away
 with them. The wife of a distinguished merchant who was at that time
 in Alexandria on business informs him that she suspected that their
 ghulam, who, it seems, was in charge of their local business, would do
 the same. She seems to have had no such apprehensions with regard to
 her maidservant, also mentioned in the letter.90
 Data about slaves set free by their masters are as numerous in the
 Geniza as the references to their running away are rare. These manu-
 missions were deeds of piety and gratitude, often enacted on the death-
 bed. One, concerned with slaves who were mere children, was discussed
 above, page 135. In another deathbed declaration, made in fall, 1230, a
 dying woman says: "My maidservant has looked after me in this and
 preceding illnesses as neither my mother nor my sister has done. 91 Now,
 please bear witness that this servant shall not be sold and not be
bought, nor be molested in any way [that is, not be taken as a
 concubine].92 Truth has come and vain things have gone fi.e., I am
 dying] 93 and I am under the mercy of God, the exalted." A declaration
 like this, which does not contain a formal expression of emancipation,
must have given many a headache to the lawyers dealing with the
execution of the will. 94 In a similar case, in Baghdad, when a member
of the family of the Head of the Diaspora declared at the point of
death: "My slave and my maid shall not be owned by anyone after my
demise," this disposition was contested by the heirs, but the Gaon
 decided that manumission was intended. 05
 In many cases slaves were emancipated by their masters during their
lifetime. This is proved by the deeds of manumission preserved and by
references to freedmen at a time when their former proprietors were
still alive. Rarely do we read about the specific circumstances under
which freedom was granted. The case described in the following was
perhaps typical. Bahiyya, a daughter of Ibn 'Awkal, a prominent
merchant and communal leader about whom we shall read again and
again, had received from her husband a slave girl of European prove-
nance whom the man had inherited from a sister. Two documents deal
with this girl, whose name was Nujum, "Stars." In the first, Bahiyya
gives her as a gift to a cousin who was married to another sister-in-law
of hers. In the-second, that cousin sets Nujiim free, his wife joining him
in the solemn act of manumission. Here we have the case of a slave
who had already changed hands within a family three times. She was
returned to the sister of the original proprietm: who, together with her
husband, then gave her her freedom. 96
 The deeds of manumission preserved correspond to the strict require-
ments of Jewish law. They state that the former slave was now entirely







 free, with neither the master nor his legal representatives having any
 r3ght on the person, progeny, or property of the emancipated. The
 latter was at liberty to adopt a new name, to marry a person of Jewish
 faith, and to do in general what any free person was allowed to do,
 including the study of the Torah. Thus, legally, the position of a
 Jewish freedman differed markedly from that of a Muslim. According
 to Muslim (and Roman) law, there remained many bonds between the
 former master and his freedman. The latter was called in Arabic
 rnawlii, which means "the attached," while in Hebrew his designation
 was "freedman." 97
In actual life, the Geniza shows us, relationships similar to those
 existing between relatives prevailed. In or out of bondage the slave
 was a member of the family. When a town was sacked by marauders, as
 happened to al-Mal}alla in the turbulent 1060's and slaves were taken
 captive, we read that their masters tried to ransom them, the same word
 being used as that applied to free persons captured in war or by pirates.
 This was in accordance with Jewish law which prescribes that the
 ransoming of slaves was as much a religious duty as ransoming free
 persons. 98 Many marriage contracts and other documents concerning
 marriages of emancipated women and men have been preserved. These
 are often called by the name of their former proprietors, and it is
 reasonable to assume that the many objects of jewelry, clothing, bed-
 ding, and household goods forming their marriage portions, were, at
 least partly, given to them by their previous masters. Even in the con-
 tract made at her second marriage (she then was a widow), Mu'tazz,
 "The one held in high esteem," is still referred to as "the freedwoman
 of Moses b. Paltiel" (most probably a member of the prominent family
 known by that name). Otherwise, all the conditions were the same as
 those in regular marriage contracts, and her dowry was far higher than
 that of many women born free. 99 Muna, "Wishes," the freedwoman of
 Ibn Futayl} (a family known through three centuries) married in 1184
 a Levi, who must have been a respected person, for he is known from
 various documents as a Parnas, or guardian of orphans and the poor.
 Twenty years later, in 1203, when she was credited with a sum of 23
 dinars, which she had lent to a perfumer, she was still called "freed-
 woman" in the relevant document, while her husband bore his title
 "Parnas." 100 It is also remarkable that in a bill of divorce from Bilbays,
 dated 1172, the divorcee Sitt al-Bayt ("The Mistress of the House-
 hold") is described as "daughter of Muwaffaq, the freedman." 101
 Similar bonds of attachment existed between male slaves and the
 rouses of their former masters. In a letter from the head of the Jewish
 community in Qayrawan, he asks his opposite number in Old Cairo
 (shortly after 1006), to help a freedman of his deceased father-in-law
 with regard to claims on the estate of a woman (probably his sister),
 who had been freed by the same relative. 102 In the terrible years of
 famine 1201-1202 a slave "took his refuge with" his former proprietor,







 a woman, and also helped her with his own money.103 In a marriage
 contract between two emancipated slaves, the bridegroom stipulates
 that his future wife should live with him in the house of his former
 master-who, by the way, bore the same name, Abu Sa'id lbn J amahir,
 as the India merchant whom we have met above (p. 133), as having
 had an affair with a slave girl.104
To repeat, Jewish law did not grant the emancipator any rights
 whatsoever on the person, progeny, or property of the slave emanci-
 pated by him. Here too, however, the influence of environment, or
 perhaps social habits, was stronger than the written law. The Geniza
 has preserved a long and interesting query addressed to Abraham
 Maimonides with the following story. A freedwoman in a little town in
 Lower Egypt at her death had left money to her friends who did not
 want to accept it, but who intended to turn it over to the community.
 Meanwhile the son of the master who had emancipated her (the son
 himself is called in the letter "her master"!), a respected and popular
 figure in the town, had become ruined in an affair of tax-farming and
 laid claim on the money. The head of the local community was very
 anxious to accede to this request, in particular as the claimant threat-
 ened to apply to a Muslim court in case it was refused. In his hastily
 scribbled marginal answer, the Nagid states that the applicant had not
 the slightest rights on the estate of a person emancipated by his father,
 of course, but there was no objection to its being turned over to him, if
 the women to whom it was given consented to such a procedure-in
 other words, the Nagid, too, favored an action in line with the gener-
 ally accepted notions. 105 In popular usage, Jewish freedmen and even
 their sons were described as mawlas, "attached to so-and-so," but the
 law would not recognize such designations. 106 In a court record from
 Fustat, dated June 28, 1080, the freedman Mubarak (who had become
 a successful businessman) was first characterized as the mawla of
 Joseph b. Joshiah, a person known from other documents, then the
 Arabic term was deleted and replaced by the Hebrew "freed by." 101
 As far as we are able to discern, there were no legal inhibitions or
discriminations against emancipated slaves. We see them marry free
 women, concluding partnerships with freemen involving considerable
sums, and appearing as attorneys in court. 108 A former slave married
to a freeman would be asked by a court to give her consent to her hus-
band's selling of a house, just as any other wife. 109 The emancipated
slaves were imbued with the social and religious notions of the com-
munity that they joined. A characteristic instance in this respect is the
will of the freedman Bundar (from the beginning of the eleventh cen-
tury), who assigned one-fourth of his estate to the poor of his town,
one-fourth to the poor of the Holy City Jerusalem, "of the Rabbanite
persuasion with exclusion of the Karaites," while the rest fell to his
heirs. One-fourth amounted to 139 taris, or Sicilian quarter dinars, by
no means a negligible sum, since the government had appropriated







 most of the estate left by Bundar.110 Another freedman appears twice
 in lists of contributors to a public charity (in the thirteenth century) .111
Was emancipation always a blessing for the person concerned? In
 answer to this question we can only state that the Geniza contains lists
 in which freed persons appear as receivers of alms and clothing from
 the public chest. Slaves do so also; perhaps this happened when their
 masters died without having set them free. 112
The slaves of the rulers who formed the prototype of the slaves em-
 ployed as business agents by the middle class also make their appear-
 ance in the Geniza papers. A typical representative of this group was
 Rayl)an, "Basil," who, in 1141, bought silk for the government, an
 activity about which we hear much in our papers, and at the same time
 was so influential that he was approached to procure one caliphal
 rescript for a private person and another for the Christians and Jews
 of Alexandria in general. The latter was intended to protect the mi-
 nority population against the encroachments of the poll-tax officials in a
 city that throughout our period (as in classical times) was notorious
for its fanaticism and unruliness.118
This study shows that the female slaves formed a vital section of the
 working population, insofar as they provided domestic help, a type of
 work shunned by free women. We, with electricity and gas and count-
 less gadgets at our disposal, can easily forego the services of a maid.
 But in the Geniza period, as in the time of our own grandparents, a
 larger household could hardly do without domestic help. This explains
 why female slavery looms so large in the Geniza papers. With respect
 to the males, one must, of course, bear in mind that a slave was obliged
 to do any service for his master, menial and other. A poet praising his
 slave for joining him in his literary pursuits and taking care of his
 library, describes him also as an excellent cook and as a most efficient
 keeper of his wa:r<lrobe.114 Similarly, we have seen that slaves accompa-
 nying their masters on their extended travels served them not only as
 business agents, but also in any other capacity, and simple domestics
 of male sex are not entirely absent from the Geniza records. Still, in the
 society reflected in these records, male slaves were far rarer than
 females, and were not mainly engaged in manual work, but belo~ged,
 more or less, to the world of commerce and finance.







 CHAPTER III



The World of Commerce
and Finance

INTRODUCTORY NOTE: Periods and Countries Prominent in the
Business Documents of the Geniza
 "Of the organization of trade before the twelfth century, not much,
if anything, is known." In the light of this statement, made recently by
a most competent expert, the information provided by the Cairo Ge-
niza documents must be regarded as particularly welcome.1 Most of the
Geniza letters, court records, and accounts related to the Mediterra-
nean trade come from the eleventh century. There are hundreds of
them, and many are extensive and full of variegated and valuable
data. To be sure, their scope is limited. Most of them originated from
Tunisian merchants living in Egypt or other countries of the Muslim
East, or who were still in their homeland. These merchants, however,
roamed about the whole Mediterranean basin, from Spain to Syria and
Palestine, and traded eagerly with the Rum, the Europeans. Thus the
organization and technique of commerce revealed by the Geniza papers
certainly has some bearing on the economic history of Europe as well.2
 The Geniza material regarding the India trade, which is not treated
in this book, covers mainly the years 1080-1160. Thus it overlaps only
in part the period during which the Mediterranean commerce is richly
illustrated in the Geniza.3 The late Fatimid and the Ayyubid epochs
 (1160-1250) are represented mostly by local Egyptian documents,
only a sprinkling of them pertaining to the international trade.
 How is this uneven distribution of Geniza material on the history of
commerce to be explained? Various factors, independent of each other,
might have been at work. During the eleventh century, most of the
middle-class Jews still lived in Fustat, or Old Cairo, where the syna-
gogue with the Geniza chamber was located. In the first half of the
twelfth century, well-to-do families had two homes, one in Fustat and
one in New Cairo, the seat of the government. By the end of that
century, most of the more affluent merchants seem to have moved to
the new city, and they normally had no opportunity to discard their
writings in the Old Cairo lumber room whose contents have come down
to us.







 It is also possible that only restric ted circles of people had religious
scruple s with regard to the burnin g of busine ss papers written
 in
Hebrew charac ters. As the Geniza proves, such notion s were definit
ely
held by the Tunjsi an Jews of the eleven th centur y, as well as
 by the
India traders of the twelfth , most of whom were of Maghr ebi
origin.
As to the third period referre d to above, the later twelfth and
 the
thirtee nth centuri es, most docum ents are somehow connec ted with
 the
rabbin ical court of Old Cairo, which had its seat in the synago
gue to
which the Geniza was attache d.
 Finally , the virissi tudes of economic history might themse lves
 be
reflected in the numbe r and nature of comme rcial papers preserv
 ed in
the Geniza . During the eleven th cenLury, despite the rise of Europe
 an
maritim e power and the encroa chmen t of the Italian cities, the
Medi-
terrane an trade still was largely in Islami c hands. Thus it is
natura l
that Arabic -speak ing Jews should have a fair share in this activit
 y.
During the twelfth centur y Europe an naval suprem acy becam
e para-
mount . Theref ore, one unders tands why Jewish midrlle -class mercha
nts
sought an outlet for their enterp rising spirit in the comme rce with
 the

 nth
centur y, the powerf ul associa tion of the so-call ed Karim is made
it
difficult for individ ual merch ants with limited means to partici

the ventur es of the India trade. 4 This would explain why the
Geniza

to the
local Egypti an scene. These suppos itions are offered here only
with
much reserva tion. Moreo ver, in confor mity with the genera l charac

 be left
to experts special izing in these fields.


A. THE MERCHANTS AND THEI R EMPLOYEES
1. TYPES OF Rt::SINE SSMml'
The time-h onored Arabic term for busine ssman, tiijir, which is
de-
 riYed from the Akkad ian, is not. commo·n in the Geniza docum ents
 and
 sen·es in them mostly as a design ation for the "big merch ant." The
very
 fact that they make mentio n of such epithe ts as "X, the Jewish
tajir,"
 "Y, the Ycmenit e tajir," "Z, the Baghd adi tajir," proves that only com-
 parath ·ely few person s were styled as such. 1 The design ation "busin
 ess-
 men," ahl aHzall'ii'ij, also was applied only to the upper crust
of the
 prof ession.2
Al-Dim ashqi's twelftb -centu ry handbo ok on the techniq ue of
 com-
 merce divides the merch ants into three eatego ries: the "hoard er,"
who
 stores the goods and sells them when prices are high; the "pereg
 rina-
 tor," who transp orts wares from one countr y to anothe r; and
the







"shipper," who is himself stationary, but sends shipments abroad.3
Al-Dimashqi, however, was concerned only with the tajir group. The
reality of commerce was far more diversified and the types participat-
ing in it far more numerous.
 Producers and dealers.-'fhe lower stratum of people engaged in
commerce was formed ,by the great mass of craftsmen who sold their
own products and occasionally ~lso those made by others (see preced-
ing chapter). In most cases the Arabic terms for a profession do not
indicate whether the persons concerned were engaged mainly in the
manufacture or in the sale of a product. Thus a jabbiin could be either
a seller or a producer of cheese; a labbiin could be either a man milking
sheep (which were kept within the city walls) or engaged mainly, or
perhaps even exclusively, in selling milk. This ambiguity exists not
only for us who read these ancient papers, but prevailed at the time the
terms were in use. Therefore, when necessary, the profession of a
person mentioned had to be defined expressly. Thus we find in a list of
contributors to a charity "X, who sells soap" immediately after "Y, the
soap-maker,'~ or at the side of the term "mat-maker," which often
merely designated a merchant selling mats, the clumsier expression
"the one who makes mats." But the very fact that the ambiguous term
was used in the overwhelming number of cases seems to indicate that a
seller of a locally produced commodity also had something to do with
its production. 4
 Retailers and wholesalers.-The distinction between retailers and
wholesalers was well developed in the society represented in the Geniza
papers, but not along the same lines as in our own time. The trading
artisan, naturally, was a retailer. The wholesale textile merchants
often sold single pieces too, as is evidenced by their accounts. The
reason for this was the relatively high value of each piece. In addition,
we read about many clothiers who clearly were retailers as were, of
course, the traders in second-hand garments. The modern American or
European, who buys new clothing every year, can hardly appreciate
the scope and impnrtance of this medieval trade. A fine textile was a
work of art, cherished regardless of its l:aving been worn before. A
chief pastime of well-to-do ladies was not only shopping (to be sure:
for yarns, fabrics, and clothing, not for food for the household), but
also selling whatever they wished to dispense with from their ward-
robe. No wonder, then, that the dealers in second-hand clothes in Old
Cairo had a bazaar of their own. 5
 A situation similar to that of the textile branch prevailed in the
second largest field of commercial activities, that of drugs, chemicals,
spices, and perfumes. The wholesale "perfumer" or "seller of potions"
also served partly as retailer, and for the same reason as did the textile
merchant: quite a number of the commodities carried by him were
expensive and out of reach of the smaller "druggist." Many, perhaps
most, of 'the "perfumers," "potion se1lers," and "apothecaries" men-







tioned in the Geniza were retailers, and their activities are well illus-
trated by their correspondence and legal documents. 6
 The real domain of the retailer was the trade in foodstuffs and
household requirements. This trade was divided into different branches
and each store had to obtain a license according to the main products it
carried. Two Geniza contracts refer to partnerships in stores "licensed
for the sale of oil and legumes." One, dated January, 1104, is particu-
larly instructive for the scope and financial capacity of such a retail
shop. The investor provided 9 dinars in cash, while his partner contrib-
uted goods of the same value, specified as follows:

 2 jars of linseed oil, worth4dinars
 4 containers of olives, worth 1dinar
 3 glass vessels (with their baskets} of
 lemon juice, worthI-¼ dinars
18 empty glass vessels, worth2 dinars
Scales for pounds, 4 leaden pounds, a ped-
lar's board with its scales and their weights,
worth¾ dinar
 Total 9 dinars

The capital was needed for replenishing the stock. Both partners
 contributed the work (presumably one mainly occupied with selling
 and the other with buying), and it was expected that both could make
 a livelihood from such an investment. 7
"The shopkeeper extends credit." This maxim of the second century
 A.D. 8 held good also in the period illustrated by the Geniza. In this
 respect there seems to have been no great difference between the
 retailer and the wholesaler, and, even with the former, buying on credit
 obviously was the rule. The Geniza has preserved batches of five,· ten,
 and twenty orders, respectively,· in which shopkeepers are advised to
 deliver specified quantities of certain commodities to the bearers. After
 assembling a certain number of such orders, the shopkeeper presuma-
 bly returned them to the senders for payment. This would explain why
 such orders have been iound together in round numbers. The five
 orders referred to above are written on tiny pieces of vellum. In them
 the shopkeeper is requested to deliver to the bearer quantities of oil,
 soap, wood, various vegetables, lemon, and sugar, and, in addition,
 small sums of cash.9 The batches of ten and twenty are addressed by
 one merchant to two different shariibis, or "sellers of juices," all con-
 taining orders for juices of lemon, pomegranates, or apples, rose oil,
 potions made of a combination of honey and vinegar (not an invention
 of the twentieth century I) with or without taste of pomegranates,· as
 well as some preserves.10 Many single orders from the hand of the same
 merchant have been traced in different collections, among them three
 to the same store for one pound of linseed oil.11







 Accounts of a shopkeeper in a provincial town from the year 1150
reveal that in some instances payment in weekly installments was
expected. In most cases, however, terms for payment are not indicated.
Similarly, in two accounts of wine merchants the customers are listed
as having received jugs of wine, or as owing certain sums of money, but
without specificatSon of when payment was due. Still another list
simply states: "Sold," followed by a great number of names, including
such common names as Jacob, or such general designations as "the
physician." The item sold is described only by quantity (mostly ½ or 1
 pound). Thus we must assume that in retail, as was the case in
wholesale, the period for which credit was granted was fixed by gener-
ally accepted usages. 12
 A few types of retailers are designated by special terms, such as the
grocer, baqqiiJ (they had a special bazaar, repeatedly referred to}, or
the keeper of a grain store, f iim"i, often mentioned in the Geniza. ta It
may be remarked in passing that the "seller" par excellence, bayyii,
was usually not a retailer in the technical sense of the word, but a
culinary specialist who himself sold the delicacies he prepare<l. Some-
times he is defined by his main line, such as "seller of boiled chick
peas." Thus this ubiquitous profession belongs in the food industry
rather than in commerce.14
 As a rule, just as the language of our sources uses the same words for
the producer of a commodity and its distributor, thus it uses the same
words for the retailer and the wholesaler. A zayyat, or "seller of oil,"
could be a modest grocer of the type we have already met, who deals in
linseed oil and a few other commodities, or he could be a great importer
of precious olive oil from Tunisia. The term sukkar'i might designate
the proprietor of a large sugar factory worth thousands of dinars, or a
small storekeeper who specialized in the sale of sugar. There is a
deathbed declaration made by a sukkari who had taken ill suddenly
 (and who died the day after making his declaration). In it he records
having received sugar worth 6 dinars from a sukkari whom he refers to
with the honorary epithet "the elder" (not applied to the dying man)
and, to whom he had paid one-third in cash; and he refers to still
another sukkar'i from whom he received sugar valued at 3 dinars. He
himself sold much smaller amounts.1 :;
 Yet it would be rash to conclude from the ambiguity of terms that in
actual practice the distinction between retailer and wholesaler was
entirely blurred. The society reflected in the Geniza records distin-
guished very clearly between "the beggars/' as the great merchants
called the small shopkeepers, and "the sons of houses/1 the members
of respectable business firms. 18 A mere glance at a Geniza letter-its
script, its arrangement, its subject matter-is sufficient to show us from
which of the two classes it emanated. Naturally, the letters of the
wholesalers are far more numerous, more extensive, more coherent and







 generally also more interesting. Still, our sources have preserved ample
 material to enable future research to depict in greater detail the world
 of the retailer.
 Merchants' diversification and specialization.-In a letter addressed
 to the flax bourse in Alexandria, a Maghrebi merchant sojourning tem-
 porarily in Bii~Ir, the great Egyptian flax center, gives the following
 instructions to a business correspondent:
 Please accept delivery of the proceeds from the two bales [of flax] which I
 sent to Maghreb. If it is cash, send it on to the elder Abu Sa'id in Old
 Cairo [who would forward it to the writer]. If it is wax, or white lead, or
 vegetable oi !, or Amidi cloth, or dark-blue wrappings, or hides, or oiled shoes,
 or gilded shoes, or red silk-sell everything in Alexandria. If it is silk with
 patterns, send it on in the shipment going to my master, the elder Abu
 Sa'id, or with any one of our friends. If it is olive oil or wool, leave it,
 until the air will become cooler.

 The very specific character of half of the twelve alternatives men-
 tioned suggests that the writer of our letter had instructed his business
 correspondent in Tunisia to buy for him any of these commodities if he
 did not choose to send cash.17
This example of almost bizarre diversity of goods handled by one
 and the same merchant could ·be multiplied ad infinitum. If we take an
 average case, a businessman from whose hand we have ten letters
 written during a reasonably short period, we find that, around 1100,
 Isaac Nisabiiri, a Persian (as is proved both by his family name and
 his Arab style) resident in Alexandria, dealt in the following commodi-
 ties:
 1. Dyeing plants (saffron, imported from Tunisia, and brazilwood,
 exported from the Indies to the Maghreb).
 2. Medical and culinary herbs (scammony, imported from Syria,
 cubeb brought from Socotra).
 3. Glass (sold for another merchant).
 4. Silk (by far the most common item).
 5. Other textiles (robes, made of brocade and scarfs).
 6. Corals (imported from Rum, that is, Christian Europe, and
 North Africa).
 7. Perfumes (ambergris-the Atlantic variety-and musk).
 8. Wax (from Tunisia).
 9. Millstones (from Syria).
10. A variety of cloths and household goods, which seem, however,
 to be items given as favors to business friends rather than articles of
 commerce.
N ahray b. Nissim, a wholesale merchant of high standing, whose
 activities we are able to follow for a period of fifty years (1045-1096)
 and whose archive contains over two hundred and fifty papers emanat-







ing from him, or addressed or referring to him, was active in the
following fields (arranged approximately according to the volume of
his business in each branch):
 1. Flax, exported from Egypt to Tunisia and Sicily.
 2. Silk (from Spain and Sicily) and other fabrics, from Syrian or
European (Rum) cotton to North African felt, and textiles of all
descriptions, from robes to bedcovers.
 3. Olive oil, soap and wax from Tunisia, occasionally also from
Palestine and Syria.
 4. Oriental spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, and clove, sent from
Egypt to the West.
 5. Dyeing, tanning, and varnishing materials such as brazilwood,
lacquer and indigo (sent from East to West); sumac and gallnuts
 (from Syria to Egypt); saffron (from Tunisia to the East).
 6. Metals (copper, iron, lead, mercury, tin, silver ingots), all West
to East.
 7. Books (Bible codexes, Talmuds, legal and edifying literature,
grammars, and Arabic books).
 8. Aromatics, perfumes, and gums (aloe, ambergris, camphor, frank-
incense, gum arabic, mastic gum, musk, betel leaves).
 9. Jewelry and semiprecious stones (gems, pearls, carnelians, tur-
quoises, onyxes, and the like).
10. Materials (such as beads, "pomegranate" strings, coral, cowrie
shells, lapis _lazuli, and tortoiseshell) used for ornaments and trinkets,
items that loomed large ip. his papers.
11. Chemicals (alkali, alum, antimony, arsenic, bamboo crystals,
borax, naphtha, sulfur, starch, vitriol).
12. Foodstuffs, such as sugar, exported from Egypt, or dried fruits,
imported from Syria.
13. Hides and leather. Also furs and shoes. All coming from, or
through, Tunisia and Sicily.
14. Pitch, an important article.
15. Varia, such as palm fiber, and items not yet identified with
certainty.
On top of all this, Nahray b. Nissim was a banker, as is evident from
the accounts written by him as well as from his correspondence. During
certain periods this must have been his main occupation.
The list by no means exhausts the types of commodities referred to
in N ahray's letters. They contain many other items, such as orders for
paper, for example. In view of the quantities specified, however, it
seems that he needed the paper personally in his threefold capacity of
scholar, merchant, and banker. The same applies to other items, such
as wheat and honey, which he probably used for his household rather
than for his business.18
 ·one wonders how one person alone could successfully handle such an
enormous variety of commodities, especially in a period that did not







 know the notion of fixed prices and where even the contents of a single
 package of the same item could obtain different prices according to
 quality and other circumstances. The technical knowledge required for
 such dealings would surpass the capacity of the most qualified man.
 Business was organized to solve this puzzle: because of widespread
 mutual assistance, a merchant was able to enlist the aid of an expert or
 specialist whenever he undertook to buy or to sell a commodity with
 which he was not familiar. He had to diversify his activities and to
 accept orders from many different categories of customers in order to
 spread the risk and to meet the fluctuation of the market. The difficul-
 ties caused by the lack of quick communication and other circum-
 stances contributed to the need to diversify. These matters will occupy
 us in some of the following sections.
Extreme diversification was by no means the only form of the
 wholesale business. It seems that the term tajir, which we already
 know as a designation for a big merchant, was reserved for those
 enormously versatile men who dealt in a great variety of goods. For we
 find the term side by side with those of specialists, as when a business
 correspondent of Nahray, writing to him from Jerusalem, describes
 how he took pains to "sell" the latter's Sicilian quarter dinars: "I left
 no tajir, wool merchant or clothier to whom I did- not offer them." 111
Bynames (such as al-nili, "the indigo merchant") and family names
(such as Ibn al-tammiir, "the son of the date merchant") derived from
 specific branches of commerce, as well as the high degree of specializa-
 tion expressed in them, indicate that concentration on a limited line of
 business must have been very common. Such names are particularly
 frequent in the domains of agricultural products of the Mediterranean
 area, Oriental imports, dyestuffs, and of luxury goods, but are found in
 practically every field. A few examples suffice to iUustra.te: (a) dis-
 tributors of acorns, fennel, gallnuts, lupines, sesame, or seeds in general;
 (b) dealers in ambergris, camphor, odoriferous wood, lacquer, m~ce, or
 (Chinese) rhubarb; (c) sellers of antimony, henna, saffron, "paints"
 (aJbiighi), or "dyestuff" (khiqiibi, by which was meant mainly indigo);
 (d) merchants in gems, unperforated pearls, gold nuggets, silver iµ.gots,
or corals.20 Not included here are the many names referring to textiles
and other industrial products bec~use the.Arabic .terms do not reveal
whether the person involved traded in the commodity, produced it, or
did both.
How far does the evidence of accounts and business letters confirm
the phenomenon of specialization, so widely attested to by names?
Since the Geniza is not an orderly archive preserving the full records of
any merchant, but a shambles · of fortuitous remnants, we are, of,
course, not in a position to answer this question with absolute cer-
tainty. We find large accounts, entirely devoted .to one branch, such as
flax, articles of clothing, or banking.transactions. We cannot, however,
conclude from this evidence that the firms from which those accounts







emanated limited their activities to the objects listed. Nahray b.
Nissim, the most versatile of all merchants known to us from the
Geniza, left us several documents that were exclusively bank state-
ments, and in one account for a partner which consisted of fifty entries,
two concerned cash, one mentioned a shipment of corals, but all the
rest specified pieces of clothing.21 Longer business letters rarely, if ever,
are confined to one item. Still, it is often evident that their writers had
one article as their main business, while all the rest represented side-
lines.
 The volume or excellence of the trader's prime commodity was
clearly the reason for his byname, which often stuck to his descend-
ants, even when they were engaged in an entirely different business.
Thus "the son of the date merchant," so frequently mentioned in
Nahray's papers, appears in them exclusively as a dealer in clothing.
"The son of the seller of odoriferous wood" and "the son of the lacquer
merchant" are often mentioned in letters from the eleventh century,
but as shipowners, not as dealers in the commodities suggested by their
family names. This question of diversification and specialization is
treated more fully in the study of the trade routes and the wares
carried on them. 22
 Itinerant and stationary merchants.-"During the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, the European 'merchants' continued to be peregri-
nators, moving constantly about in unending pursuit of profit. They and
their servants still accompanied their goods either by land or by sea." 23
In the countries bordering the Mediterranean on the east, south, and
west, the situation was markedly different. The Muslim handbook of
commerce mentioned earlier divides merchants into hoarders, travelers
and stationary shippers.24 Of the three definitions used, only the second,
rakkiiq, literally "runner/' appears in the Geniza as a technical term,
but in the more limited sense of traders moving from one little town of
the Egyptian Rif to another selling textiles. "I bought forty pounds of
silk from 'runners' in Minyat Zifta,11 writes a merchant around 1140.25
Seventy years or so earlier a merchant from Tinnis, the great linen
center, informed a business friend by letter that he was leaving for the
Rif for the duration of twenty days to sell silk. Numerous legal docu-
ments and letters refer to this type of business trip. 28
 These smaller traders of comparatively limited scope are to be
differentiated from the itinerant merchants engaged in international
commerce. It is the latter who provide the major portion of the busi-
ness correspondence preserved in the Geniza-which is natural, since
they had the need and the occasion to write letters more than others.
They, too, were not all of one type, but were roughly divided into two
groups. The first may appropriately be characterized as commuters, for
we find them moving incessantly between Tunisia, Sicily, and Egypt,
say, or between Egypt and the far West {Morocco and Spain), or
Egypt and Palestine and Syria. References to their travels are abun-







 dant, as well as remarks like: "This year I shall stay put and not
 travel," or: "It is already midsummer and you have not yet come."
 The other group may be called migrants. They were merchants who
 migrated to another country and stayed there for some years, doing
 business with their family and friends back home. Many, as the
 Geniza shows, settled in their new domicile, others went back and were
 replaced by younger members of the same family or same circle of
 merchants.
 Two reasons must account for the prevalence of travel in medieval
 trade. The shortcomings and hazards of transport required that a pro-
 prietor of merchandise either accompany it in person or entrust it to an
 employee or business friend. A captain or a sailor sometimes took care
 of shipments, but, as a rule, only when these were of limited volume
 and value.21
 The most compelling reason for travel, however, was the technique
 of trade, the belief so often repeated in the Geniza letters, that "one
 who is present secs what one who is absent cannot see." 2 ~ Personal,
 intimate knowledge of prospective customers as well as of the produc-
 ers or providers of goods to be purchased was regarded as the foremost
 prerequisite of successful business. Our letters demonstrate that as a
 rule the veteran merchants back in Qayrawan knew every customer in
 Old Cairo who bought the goods they dispatched. And they were
 familiar with the localities and offices where flax, the staple grown in
 many different places in Egypt, was bought on their account to be sent
 to Tunisia.
 The coming and going of the itinerant merchapts determined the
 rhythm of life-and not only in the metropolitan cities. "All people
[i.e., the foreign merchants] have returned the stores [rented by them
 for the business season) and are leaving," writes a Tunisian sojourning
in Old Cairo.29 "The synagogue is desolate, for the Maghrebis have
left," we read in a letter from the same city.30 A businessman in
 al-Mahdiyya reports: "Flax is being sought after this-year only at the
 time of departure [namely of the merchants who sell it in the West] or
 of the Andalusians [meaning the arrival of the prospective purchas-
ers]." 31 A man, writing from Bush (about 75 miles south of Cairo) to
his mother in Alexandria, remarks that many caravans are commuting
between Alexandria and Bush for the purchase of flax. 32 We shall come
back to these peregrinators in our chapter on Travel and Seafaring,
pages 273 ff., below.
 On the other hand, al-Dimashqi's division of merchants into travel-
ers and those who stay put and send shipments with others is fully
borne out by the testimony of the Geniza. The evidence it yields may
be summarized as follows: the majority of the writers of business
letters were itinerant merchants, but most of those to whom they were
addressed were stationary. Naturally, the latter had more opportunity
to dispose of their correspondence in the Geniza chamber. But the







references contained in letters and documents also prove that many of
the most prominent merchants were sedentary and conducted their
business through correspondence and representatives.
 Nahray b. Nissim, .whose multilateral activities have been discussed
above, traveled from Qayrawan to Old Cairo in 1045 and subsequently
returned on one or more occasions to his home country. Moreover, he
visited Jerusalem several times, as well as the major towns of Syria
and Lebanon. He frequented the flax-growing centers in Egypt, where
he befriended the Muslim and Jewish local m1thorities. The great
majority of letters addressed to him was sent to Old Cairo, however,
and the contents of his correspondence also reveal that during most of
his life he lived in that town.
 During the firsG quarter of the eleventh century, a great merchant
called Joseph Ibn 'Awkal loomed in the Geniza records as the predomi-
nant public figure. He transmitted the donations and queries from the
Jewish communities all over North Africa to the Jewish academies of
Baghdad, and the letters, treatises, and books sent by the latter he
forwarded to the communities or persons for whom they were destined.
 (But not before having them copied. For this reason, the Geniza
conta5ns so many fragments of these writings.) All communal, per-
sonal, and business letters addressed or referring to him assume that he
always lived in Old Cairo. None of the many letters allude to any
meeting with him outside this city. His correspondence reveals that the
dispatch from Alexandria of most voluminous and high-priced goods
sent overseas was not supervised by him in person, but entrusted to
agents or associates. Thus Ibn 'Awkal is a perfect example of
Dimashqi's third type of merchant, the one who does not accompany
his wares but lets them be handled by others.
 It is also true that medium-sized wholesale business could be trans-
acted by stationary merchants. The merchants whose role as social-
service officers and "trustees of the court" is described in M editerra-
nean Society, Volume II, chapter v, section B, were of lesser stature
than Ibn 'Awkal but still very influential in the community, and their
business was many sided and geographically of a wide scope. All the
same, their entire correspondence, as well as many court records, shows
them invariably as residents of Old Cairo.
 More or less permanent residence was particularly required of those
merchants who served as legal and commercial representatives of oth-
ers. This most important office of the wakil al-tujjiir, or representatives
of the merchants, is discussed on pages 186-192, below. The sedentary
character of such a wakil is here illustrated by the story of an elev-
enth-century merchant known to us through a remarkable series of
letters and documents.
 Judah b. Moses Ibn Sighmar was the scion of a great family of
scholars, judges, and merchants. In the summer of 1048 he traveled
from his native city of Qayrawan to Egypt. We find him also in







 Tripoli, Lebanon. For it was common practice for Tunisian merchants
 ~raveling to the East to visit the markets of Lebanon and Syria {and to
 make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem). Ibn Sighmar, however, settled in
 Old Cairo and married into a local family, "famous in East and West."
 He acted as legal representative of his Tunisian countrymen, and
 documents to this effect, bearing dates as widely separated from each
 other as 1055 and 1098, have been found. A letter from Mazara, Sicily,
 the longest business paper I have seen, and another from Alexandria,
 designate him as al-wakil, the representative. The letter from Alexan-
 dria is addressed to his office, and most probably also warehouse, in the
 Lane of the Leatherbottle Makers in Old Cairo.33
Ibn Sighmar must have been successful and munificent, as the honor-
 ary titles conferred on him indicate, and as is confirmed by the follow-
 ing statement found in a letter from Jerusalem: "In His grace God has
 brought Abu Zikri [Ibn Sighmar's byname], the member of the acad-
 emy, from the West, so that he should be in Mif?r [Old Cairo] a
 support for everyone coming from anywhere: from Iraq, Syria and
 Palestine, the West, and the countries of the Rum [Europe], being
 kind to them, spending on them his fortunes, and using his high social
 position (jiih) for their best. May God preserve the wealth He has
 given him and increase it and let him witness the joy [i.e., the wed-
 ding] of his son." 34
Letters addressed or referring to Judah lbn Sighmar show him as
 active in Old Cairo, and it is characteristic that thus far not a single
 instance of an exchange of written communication between him and his
 contemporary Nahray b. Nissim has been accounted for (although he
 is repeatedly mentioned in the latter's correspondence). The reason is
 self-evident. During most of their lives the two men were in the same
 city. Once, in 1075, Ibn Sighmiir visited his native city of Qayrawan,
 and there is one letter, sent around 1068, addressed to him while in
 Alexandria. But this very letter contains a passage that proves travel
 was for him the exception rather than the rule. For it was from his
 wife, who then was expecting her third child and whose firstborn was
 old enough to serve as his mother's scribe, and in her letter she says: "I
 cannot grasp that I should be in one city and you in another." It is also
 noteworthy that Ibn Sighmar had a slave who acted as his business
agent overseas.35
 The stationary merchants thus far discussed were all based in Old
Cairo. This circumstance is not so only because the Geniza chamber
was found in that city. As we shall see, Cairo during the eleventh
century was the exclusive metropolis of commerce and finance in Egypt,
with Alexandria trailing far behind. But there also were such mer-
chants in Alexandria, the Geniza reveals, who, besides doing business
for themselves, acted as shipping agents for others. In addition to Isaac
Nisabiiri (seep. 153, above), we know of at least four of his contempo-
raries whose considerable correspondence shows them to be residents of







Alexandria. 38 It should be noted that the contents alone, and not the
 number of letters and references, prove that the person concerned was
mainly or solely active in that city. For most of the letters coming
 from Alexandria were written by peregrinators.
Brokers, auctioneers, and other middlemen.-In addition to the five
 types of merchant described, namely the retailer, the small itinerant of
 limited scope, the commuter between one country and another (who
 normally was active in many branches), the specialist in one choice
 commodity, and the sedentary big or medium-sized merchant (who
often served as representative for foreigners), we come to another
 group: the brokers and other middlemen.
In his delightful book Travels in Persia, which describes life in that
 country during the seventeenth century, Sir John Chardin has this to
say concerning the respectable merchants: "They make no bargains
themselves directly; and there is no public place of exchange in their
towns; the trade is carried on by stock jobbers." The Mediterranean
 merchants of the High Middle Ages attended to their dealings in
 person to a far greater extent than did their Persian colleagues of the
seventeenth century, according to Sir John's testimony. Still, the serv-
ices of middlemen (and -women) were widely used. We hear much
about these people in the Geniza papers, but have comparatively few
documents from them themselves. This is natural, since their transac-
tions usually were conducted directly and orally.
 Throughout the centuries our sources speak of three types of middle-
men, although the distinction among them is not always evident to

 First comes the time-honored term simsar, or agent, borrowed by the
Arabs from the Persians and going back perhaps to the ancient
Sumerians. From the Arabs, the word came into Italian and German
 (sensale, Sensal) and into several other European languages. The
Geniza and cognate sources make mention of various kinds of simsars.
There was the real estate broker, confining himself, as modern realtors
often do, to certain neighborhoods. 37 In one Geniza document such a
person is called al-wiisita, literally the middleman. 38 A simsar could
specialize in textiles, having no store of his own, but receiving large
quantities of goods on commission.39 In a document dated February 26,
1225, two members of an orphans' court betake themselves to "the
bazaar of the clothiers" and sell there certain garments through "a
great simsar." This seems to indicate that the latter had his fixed seat in
that locality. By coincidence, another document written on the same
day and dealing with the same matter has been preserved. Here, the
"great simsar" is simply referred to as muniidi, or market crier, auction-
eer, and in both documents the compensation paid to him is called
dilala, or broker's fee.'°
 Dallii.l, or broker, is indeed the most comprehensive designation for
the group of persons with whom we are concerned here, and dilala is







 the general word for commission, occurring innumerable times in the
 accounts found in the Geniza. 41 A dalliil could be a wealthy person,
 participating with a large sum in an overseas undertaking, or a misera-
 ble broker earning a few dirhems a day. The term munadi, or auction-
 eer, as we have seen, could even be applied to a big agent, but usually
 was confined to persons who were actually engaged in hawking at
 market. Sometimes the locality in which such a man was active was
 specified in his designation, such as "the crier in the bazaar of the wool
 merchants," "the crier in the bazaar of the Exchange {Alexandria,
 1132) ," "the perfumery broker in Fustat." In most of our documents,
 r,owever, munadi, as the name of a profession, is not defined more
 closely, while it could be said of any merchant or artisan that he "cried
 out" (we would say "advertised") a certain commodity during a cer-
 tain period.42
Female brokers.-As the Geniza documents show, female brokers
 must have been of considerable economic importance. The ladies of the
 Muslim upper class were not allowed by their husbands to visit the
 bazaars of the clothiers, or at least to visit them as often and as long as
 they would have liked. Therefore, women agents frequented the harems
 and offered there the precious textiles. In a contract dated March 23,
 1138, a big tax-farmer cedes his rights on the taxes on the sale and
 dyeing of silks with regard to a certain quarter of Old Cairo. He
 reserves for himself, however, the right to do business with seven
 women, four of whom bore out-and-out Muslim names; two of these
 brokers are mentioned together with their (female) partners. In a
 detailed day-to-day account of a textile merchant and in a short note
 by the same, there appear another eight women taking specified fabrics
 on credit or paying for them. Here, too, most of the names are Mus-
 lim.43 We have even found a female Jewish broker dealing in Hebrew
 books!'
The most £requently mentioned woman in all the Geniza records is a
 dallala, or broker, who, to judge from her will, must have been very
 successful in her dealings. We tell her story in Mediterranean Society,
 Volume III, chapter ix.

 2. THE EMPLOYEES
It was regarded as degrading, even by the small craftsman, to be
 employed by someone else. For a man embracing the noble profession
 of merchant it was a disaster. Most characteristically for the notion of
 employee our sources regularly use the word !}abi, "boy," "young man,"
 even if he was already so advanced in years as to be given the honorary
 title "the elder." The idea was that only the transitory state of ap-
 prenticeship was commensurate with the respectability of a free man,
 while permanent dependence was deemed unbearable.1
Yet, the bigger merchants could not do without a staff. First, they
 needed clerks for their correspondence and accounts. This was espe-







 cially necessary since letters and the accounts accompanying them
 often were sent in a number of copies. In one case we read about five
 copies of each of thirteen letters forwarded from Alexandria to Tunisia
 via five different boats, and another case of one letter in four copies
 also sent from Alexandria to Tunisia.2
Merchants often wrote their correspondence in their own hand, espe-
 cially when they were abroad with no clerk close by, or when the
 secrecy of the subject matter made the employment of help inadvis-
 able. It was not customary to sign letters, but the handwriting of a
 great many merchants is known to us through their signatures in legal
 documents, through postscripts they added to the letters of friends,
 through introducing themselves by name, and in other ways. It is
 certain that larger business houses employed one or two or even three
 clerks, for we possess letters from them written in two to four different
 scripts. We have direct evidence of this. In a court record from Old
 Cairo referring to the years 1040-1041, four visitors from Tunisia
 testified to the authenticity of various business letters, written in
 Arabic characters, emanating from one lbn al-Majjani of Qayrawan.
 They did so by asserting that they knew the handwriting of the two
 clerks "who used to write the letters to the merchants for
 Ibn al-Majjani." 3
The employment of scribes by business houses must have been of a
 fairly permanent character. As stated, it was not customary to sign
 letters. The name of the sender appeared only on the address, namely
 its left upper corner, or was merely indicated by such phrases as "from
 your friend," or "from one grateful for your kindness." The recipient
 therefore had only one means of ascertaining the authenticity of a
 letter: his familiarity with the handwriting of his correspondent or of
 the latter's clerk. In exceptional cases (presumably when a new scribe
 was employed) the letter itself would be written by the scribe, while
 the chief of the business house would write the address.' This procedure
 may seem peculiar to us, but was natural in a civilization that had the
 proverb: "The address of a letter is like the face of its sender." Some
 sources indicate tr.at the scribes were paid by piece. We do not know
 whether this was a general practice, although very likely it was.
A merchant needed help even when he had only one store or office. If
 he was not assisted by a partner or a relative, he had an employee or a
 slave. If he was the proprielior of several business premises, such
 assistance was indispensable. In the contract on the conveying of the
 rights of a tax-farmer (mentioned on p. 161) the latter stipulated that
 the contracting party was not entitled to sell silk to "the young men"
 employed in his own stores. Incidentally, this stipulation shows that
 the employees, in addition to working for their master, were entitled to
 do bus1ness on their own account. This must have been the established
 custom as is evident from all relevant documents.
Compensation of the employee undoubtedly varied widely according







 to the status of both sides and the nature and value of the help
 provided. At the lowest level we read of a daily wage averaging 2 to 3
 dirhems. In the example given on page 96, above, it is not indicated
 whether the employee was engaged in manual or clerical work. In a
 highly interesting account submitted in 1046 to an employer, the writer
 lists his living expenses (approximately 1-½ dinars per month), which
 seems to imply that these were borne by the employer, for sundry
 personal expenses appear in the account as 'debits on the writer. But
 there is no indication in this, or in any other such account, of the
 existence of a salary .5 In two almost identical letters, one to his parents
 and one to his sister, a young man from Qayrawan reports that he
 intended to take service with a great Tunisian merchant in Old Cairo,
 but had heard that he "was mean and niggardly, employing a man for
 one year and letting him be without work for ten." Here, too, where we
 would expect it, there is no clue to the amount of remuneration.8 We
 must conclude that the relationships between employer and employee
 were regulated through the same legal instruments as those between
 independent merchants, namely partnership, commends, commission,
 or mutual service, with the proviso that the employer promised to
 provide work, while the employee undertook to follow the instructions
 of his master.
This state of affairs is learned from business letters in which the
 correspondents appear to be engaged with each other in regular com-
 mercial relations, but in which one side gives orders to the other. Thus
 we read in a long letter sent from Qayrawan to Egypt on August 9,
 1048, which also contains detailed accounts about transactions between
 the writer and the addressee: "I was happy to learn from your letter
 that you are coming this year. I allowed you to stay last year only
 because then you had not many goods." Later on in the letter, the
 "master" asks the "pupil" to buy certain choice textiles in Old Cairo
 for a business friend of his and to give this order preference over all his
 own affairs. Finally, he instructs him to do some errands for his wife in
 the Egyptian capital.7 In a court record dated 1039 and dealing with
 such a relationship (the enterprise concerned was the ritual killing of
 animals), th!:l senior partner explained that the junior was not permit-
 ted to do anything except on his command.8
In the two similar letters from the young Tunisian to his parents and
 sister, in which he expressed his hesitation over accepting a post as
 employee, he also made the following remark: "Moreover, I am afraid
 that I would have to travel too much in his service and thus be cut off
 from you." In the Geniza it is indeed from merchants in their capacity
 as traveling agents that we hear most about commercial employment.
 Goods and cash were entrusted to such young men whether they
 were Jewish employees of Jewish merchants or Muslim employees
 of Muslim merchants." The great Ibn 'Awkal {cf. p. 158) had at least
 two such aids at the same time, one Jewish and one Muslim. In a letter







 iii, B; 1
 addressed to him from Alexandria, his Jewish factotum asks him for a
 discarded robe of his for the High Holidays.10 This request recalls the
 custom of Muslim rulers of bestowing on meritorious servants robes
 embroidered with their own names. This ancient Oriental custom car-
 ried with it the connotation of "throwing one's mantle," conferring his
 authority, on the person thus honored. In any case, having been the
 ~abi of a great merchant was a distinction that stuck for lifetime. When
 a shipowner is called "the employee of so-and-so," it is very probable
 that he bore that designation long after he had become independent,
 or even after the death of his master. 11
The term ~abi, which we have translated literally as "boy" or "young
 man," was perhaps understood to mean "schoolboy" or rather "pupil,"
 since the employer was referred to as mu'allim, or "master," "teacher."
 The relationship itself was essentially that of the master initiating the
 pupil into business, and was actually called "education." We deal with
 this interesting aspect of medieval Mediterranean society in the section
 on vocational training (Med. Soc., Vol. II, chap. vi, sec. 5).
The role of slaves as business agents was of limited importance (see
 above, pp. 132 ff.). Commerce, as far as recognizable through the
 Geniza records, was mainly based on cooperation and partnership, not
 on employment and service.


 B. THE WAYS OF COMMERCIAL COOPERATION
 1. 11 FRIENDSHIP 11 AND INFORMAL 11 COOPERATION 11
In a Jetter sent on March 5, 1026, from al-Ahwaz, a great textile
center in southwestern Iran, to Old Cairo, the writer enumerates ship-
ments of choice fabrics dispatched to the addressees and asks the
recipients to seH them and with the proceeds to buy for him whatever
they deemed advantageous. He attaches a long list of exquisite Egyp-
tian textiles, which he requests them to acquire for him. The letter, as
usual, is fuH of polite phrases such as "may God reward you copiously"
 (since human beings are not able to reciprocate such great favors
appropriately), or "my money and your money are one," or "all profit
accruing to me comes from your pocket." Still, the tenor of the letter
makes it amply clear that the services expected were not regarded as a
favor, but as a duty of the writer1s business correspondents. This
aspect is expressly emphasized by phrases such as: "please buy . . . in
return for my services to you," or: "I am no stranger to you," or, the
normal conclusion of a business letter: "do not withhold from me your
letters with reports about your well being and your requirements so
that I may deal with them, as is my duty." 1
 The receivers of this letter were the three senior Tustari brotlters
whose probity and success attracted even the attention of Muslim
historiography, which generally does not occupy itself with the mer-







 chant class. (To be sure, Abii Sa'd, a son of one of the three brothers,
 became the most influential man in the Fatimid empire before he was
 murdered in 1047 [seep. 183, below].) The Tustaris, although them-
 selves hailing from southern Iran, had been established in Egypt for
 many years. Thus we see two firms (the man in Al-Ahwaz also men-
 tions his son as sender) in two very distant countries, Egypt and Iran,
 doing business with each other in an entirely informal way: selling and
 buying for each other. As is proved by the majority of business letters
 preserved in the Geniza, this form of commercial cooperation was the
 main pattern of international trade in those days.
We have observed two stationary firms exchanging services. Com-
 muting merchants did the same. An experienced Tunisian trader gives
 advice to a young business friend sojourning in Egypt:
 "So-and-so [also a young Tunisian active in Egypt] sent me a letter
 suggesting-which I intended to do anyhow-that you two should co-
 operate [literally: that your hand and his hand should be in your affairs
 and in his]. When you travel to Bu~ir [to buy flax] you take the trouble
 to purchase for him what he needs, while he will take care of oil and
 soap [which were procured in Tunisia]. When you tarry here [in Tunisia],
 you will look here after his affairs, while he will travel to Egypt and make
 purchases for you and for himself, for he is an expert in flax and other
 [Egyptian] goods. I shall be very pleased with this friendship between
 the two of you. For he will take Abu Sa'id's place with you [the writer's
 cousin with whom the addressee had a similar relationship and who was on
 his way to Tunisia]. I need not stress this matter any further, for your
 success depends on it." 2

 In the passages quoted, merchants of equal footing, whether station-
 ary or commuting, long established or just beginning, are informally
 cooperating with each other. We are able to observe similar relation-
 ships between "master" and "disciple," or between a big firm and one
 of far more limited size. In the letter of the trader to his young friend
 in Egypt, the Tunisian veteran imposes on his apprentice quite a lot of
 errands to be done for him in Egypt. On the other hand, he also gives
 him advice, what to ship on his own account to Tunisia where he, the
 writer, would take care of it. "By God, I know that working with me
 guarantees your prosperity. For you confide your affairs to one who
 will not spoil them." 8
In a long and angry letter to the great lbn 'Awkal one of his many
 business correspondents in Qayrawan makes a remark about their
 mutual relationship. Among many other things, Ibn 'Awkal had been
 dissatisfied with the writer's handling of a shipment of brazilwood,
 which the latter had sold in the capital of Tunisia, instead of sending it
 on, as instructed, to Spain. The Qayrawan merchant, proudly empha-
 sizes: "God's bounty is plentiful with me," and: "I need no special
 favors, for the little we have here in the West [Tunisia] is like the
 much you have over there [in Egypt]" and expresses his disappoint-







 ment that Ibn 'Awkal, instead of praising his initiative, scolded him for
 acting against instructions given to him. "I have not taken your
 brazilwood for me, nor made any profit with it. It gave me only
 trouble. I am working for you, because I honor you and because you
 help me through your high social position with the goods I ship to you
 on my account." 4
The list of services rendered by business friends to one another
 according to the Gcniza records is endless. First, a merchant had to
 deal with the shipments sent by his correspondent, namely, to accept
 and then sell them as profitably as possible, and then collect on them
(which was quite a different undertaking). From the proceeds, pay-
 ments often had to be made to persons specified. Then local goods had
 to be purchased either according to a list provided or at the discretion
 of the buyer. Their dispatch in good time and in seaworthy ships had
 to be arranged and supervised, often, owing to the lack of shipping
 space, a most exacting task. Sometimes, the goods had to be processed
 before being shipped. Flax had to be co:nbed, unbleached textiles
 bleached, pearls perforated, and so on.
The same services, albeit to a lesser degre•~, were expected to be done
 for friends of business friends. A short note from such a "friend of a
friend" (translated in Mediterranean People) illustrates. A merchant
in Fez, Morocco, had done a favor for a merchant in Old Cairo. Now a
 friend (not named) of the Fez merchant sends, via an Alexandrian
business friend, a certain commodity to the Old Cairo merchant with a
request to sell it and buy for its price a specified Oriental perfume.
Such farfetched reciprocity of favors was by no means exceptional. 5
For such transactions exact accounts had to be delivered, an activity
often more burdensome on the merchants, it seems, than the operations
themselves. The actions taken or recommended had to be explained,
and sometimes, evidently, to a critical reader.
The second largest group of services expected from a business friend
was the supervision and assistance of other merchants working for the
writer who were either terribly busy, had constantly to be reminded of
keeping their promises, or were inexperienced beginners who had to be
guided or foreigners who could not be entirely trusted. It is no exagger-
ation to say that every second Geniza letter sent abroad contains
reports or requests with regard to the activities of other merchants
connected with either the writer or the addressee.
Third, friends exchanged business intelligence: information about
prices (official and real), volume of business, prospective buyers, move-
ment of ships and caravans, and any other detail conducive to success-
ful transactions. The preparation of such reports, scores of which have
been preserved, must have required mountains of time and effort.
 Last, but not least, traveling merchants were expected to carry with
them goods of their business correspondents or to supervise their trans-
port. This was done in four different ways. Small consignments were







packed either into the big bales of the traveler or, as a smaller package,
above them. In the case of complete bales confided to him, the traveler
was requested to "sit on them," that is, to supervise them in person, or
to keep an eye on them when they were entrusted to another passenger
or a captain. Precious shipments of small size, as well as cash, were
carried in the traveler's k,haff, or light baggage.6
 Business cooperation frequently developed into personal friendship,
and one has the impression that this was regarded as natural, or even
as a necessary condition for success. Consequently we often find in
business letters the sort of request asked of a close relative or intimate
friend. These little-and sometimes not so little-requests are a pre-
cious source for social history, and are not confined to the world of
commerce and finance.
 Presents exchanged between business friends-a regular feature of
the India trade-seem not to have been customary in the Mediterra-
nean basin. A few exceptions, such as fifteen pounds of salted tuna fish
sent from Tunisia to a friend in Egypt, or two jars of wine plus "a
present worth a quarter dinar" destined for a junior business friend,
confirm the rule.1
 More often than not, informal cooperation was accompanied by one
or more partnerships concluded between the correspondents, frequently
with additional partners. Almost any larger accounts in the Geniza
contain items such as "you personally," "I personally," "our partner-
ship with so-and-so." Merchants appear as managers or capitalists in
commenda contracts concluded with their correspondents.
 This being so, it is natural that correspondents were sometimes
in doubt whether certain goods or sums were sent on their friends' own
account or on a partnership's account. Remarks to this effect are
common, and in general such questions were treated with a certain
laxity. A letter to Old Cairo from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, in which two
such occurrences are noted, reports also the following: The market
price for pepper in Tunisia was bad, 130 quarter dinars. The traders
from the East were happy when they could get rid of their stock for
130-132. The writer was reluctant to sell his Egyptian correspondent's
pepper at a price that was then (early eleventh century) regarded as
particularly poor. He therefore kept it until the time of the sailing of
the autumn convoys, when he sold it to some Spanish merchants for 133
quarter dinars. On the very night preceding the departure of the
convoys there arrived boats with new prospective buyers and the price
jumped to 140-142. The writer, a Tunisian merchant, who had retained
his pepper, did not want to keep all the profit for himself. He therefore
informed his correspondent that he treated all pepper handled by him
as a partnership so that they would share loss and profit in common.'
 When we realize the variety of activities, it is not surprising that
"dealing with one's friends business affairs" was one of the major
preoccupations of writers of the Geniza letters.• Naturally, things did







 not always work out well, and complaints, sometimes even bitter
 reproaches, are not lacking. We have already encountered one of the
 main causes of discord: acting against the correspondent's instructions.
Such instructions were sometimes very exact: "Please sell my saffron
 for five dinars per mann [a weight of two pounds] on two months'
 credit. If you do not find such a buyer, leave it until my arrival." 10
Sometimes they left more leeway, concluding with the polite phrase, "a
 person like you needs no instructions," or "your own opinion has
 preference/' to which the saying "one who is present sees what one who
is absent cannot see" would be added (cf. above, p. 157) .11 Often the
initiative is left entirely to the correspondent. The phrase normally
used in this connection is "buy for me what God puts into your heart"
or simply "whatever you deem fit." 12 But even given free rein, some
correspondents were not sure of satisfying their friends, Our letters are
therefore full of assurances that the writer had made every possible
effort for his friend's affairs. One writer repeats three times that he
 never gives preference to his own interests over those of the addressee,
and another mentions: "I have remained here in Alexandria [ for six
weeks] mainly for the shipping of your goods." A third assures his busi-
ness friend that he had endangered his own life and traveled to a city
with which his native town was at war mainly for the sake of his
 friend's affairs, which he describes in great detail.13 The usual com-
plaint was tardiness in rendering accounts or in forwarding the sums
obtained in a sale or in the dispatch of merchandise. Occasionally, ·we
find more serious reproofs such as charging an expenditure made on
behalf of the recipient's business on the writer's account.1•
It is, however, most noteworthy that in the very same letters wherein
the writer heaps strongly worded accusations on his business friend, he
expresses the greatest eagerness to continue their cooperation. We had
such a case in the angry letter addressed to Ibn 'Awkal (above, p. 165).
In a letter to him by another Qayrawanese merchant he is admonished
to pay the writer his due (with the unusual warning "remember that
life and death are in God's hand." It was bad style to dle with debts on
one's head). Still, the writer emphasizes: "Please honor me with the
execution of your affairs in buying and selling and whatever else you
may advise me to do for you, except what belongs to the elder Abii
'Imran. You will realize how eager I shall be in carrying out your
orders and you will honor me by them." 15
The phrase "except what belongs to the elder Abu 'lmriin" reveals
another aspect of informal business cooperation. Abu 'Imran (Musa
lbn al-Majjani) was the apprentice, confidant, and main representa-
tive of Ibn 'Awkal in Qayrawin, as is known from several Geniza
records. The Qayrawanese merchant who wrote that angry letter
wished to emphasize that he did not intend to encroach upon Abu
'lmran's prerogatives and protested the insinuation that he had asked
Ibn 'Awkal to make him instead of Abii 'lmrin his main representative







 in the Tunisian capital. Abii 'Imriin himself reports a case where his
 master had given instructions to another merchant with regard to
 business in Qayrawan without consulting or informing him, with
 detrimental results for both. 16
Even when terminating regular business relations with a correspond-
 ent, one tried not to close the door altogether. In the long letter referred
 to on page 159, above, a Tunisian merchant living in Sicily liquidates all
 his partnerships and other affairs with his Egyptian representative and
 renders detailed accounts. It was done at the request of the addressee,
 "but I desired it even more, for when a companionship lasts too long,
 one gets weary of each other." Then, after almost four thousands words
 of grudge: "I know, my lord, that your love of me is not marred by any
 uncertainty," and he gives him an order, "so that our close relationship
 should not be cut off entirely." 11
The most common, and, so to say, official designation for informal
 business cooperation, was ~UQba, or companionship. Merchants of lesser
 stature would simply be described as the -1iiQib, or "companion" of a
 merchant or firm of greater reputation, and this not only in letters, but
 also in documents.18 The Tunisian merchant, whose long letter was
 discussed in the preceding paragraph, wrote a few years before to his
 .Egyptian correspondent that both should have no l}a}Jib except each
 other, and that he would travel from Sicily to Egypt merely to renew
 their longstanding business association. 111 Friendship, ~adiiqa, was also a
 very common term. "Cooperation" mu'iimala, literally "having dealings
 with each other," would be used in order to describe a relationship as
 informal, not based on a legal instrument. Other expressions, such as
 "mutual kindness" or "close relationship" were also used. 20
In the last source cited, "mutual kindness" is described as "old." One
 business letter speaks of a l}U};lba of forty years. 21 Such relationships
 could and did last for several generations.
The nature of informal business cooperation as just described is not
 easy to grasp. For at first sight it seemed strange that a merchant
 should invest so much time and work in the mere expectation that his
 efforts would be properly reciprocated, or, as our sources say, "he
 serves there and I serve here," "you are in my place there, for you
 know well that I am your support here." 22 But this is exactly what
 happened. An 'umiila, or commission, was paid for special services
(discussed later in this chapter), not for the relationship with which we
 are concerned here. The fact remains that the Mediterranean trade, as
 revealed by the Cairo Geniza, was largely based, not upon cash bene-
 fits or legal guarantees, but on the human qualities of mutual trust and
 friendship.

 2. PARTNERSHIPS AND COMMENDA
 Informal business cooperation could last for a lifetime, even for
 several generations. Formal partnerships were of short duration in







principle and limited to specific undertakings, but this legal institution
was enormously developed. It encompassed practically every economic
activity: industrial, such as running a workshop, producing wine,
building a house; or commercial, equally as common in the wholesale
trade as in retail business; or connected with public administration
such as tax farming, the basis of the whole economy of the state, or
working in the royal mint or exchange, and occasionally even in public
office such as that of judge, court clerk, or cantor.
 The profusion of partnerships in the Geniza period was due to the
fact that it substituted for two large fields that are today covered by
other forms of contracts: employment and loans on interest. We have
already studied twenty-seven contracts of industrial partnership,
many of which are nothing but veiled forms of employment, and we
encounter similar arrangements in commerce and banking. We also saw
why medieval people were so opposed to the idea of being in the service
of another and preferred the dignity of cooperation.1 The difficult
problem of loans on interest is studied in the section on banking (pp.
250-258, below) . Even a cursory examination of the Geniza material
reveals that lending money for interest was not only shunned reli-
giously, but was also of limited significance economically. The reason
for this was in some measure the same as that which induced people to
avoid employment: "The borrower is a slave to the lender" (Prov.
22:7). Borrowing money manifested some sort of dependence-a state
of affairs underlined by the fact that loans were often given as an act
of charity. Therefore, the economic role of financial investment today
was then fulfilled by various forms of partnership.
 Partnerships could be concluded with regard to money, goods, or
work, or any combination, and the most variegated of them appear in
our records. There was no difference in principle among the variations.
Any of them could be and was ref erred to loosely as partnership, shirka
in Arabic and shilthiifuth in Hebrew.2 It is practicable, though, to dis-
cern between two main types of contracts: in one, the contractors offer
the various services in equal or unequal shares and partake in profit or
loss in proportion to their investments; and in the other, one or several
partners contribute capital or goods or both, while the other or others
do the work, in which case they receive a smaller share in the profits,
normally one-third, but do not participate in the losses.
 The first type was called shirka, partnership, in the s~rict sense of the
word, or, even more commonly, khulta, literally "mixing (of the in-
vestments)." The relationship was also expressed by some figurative
phrases, such as k"is wiilJ,id, "one purse," or lil-wasat, "into the midst,"
or baynanii, "between us," because, as we learn from several documents1
the "mixed" money was actually put into one purse, and, we may
imagine, this purse lay between the two contractors as they threw their
coins into it in the presence of witnesses. Such figurative expressions
were already found in talmudic literature in Hebrew, but seem to belong
to the legal language of the Near East in general.







The second type of contract was called qira<J,, meaning "mutual loan,"
 one lending capital and the other work until the completion of the re-
 lationship, or mu<f,iiraba, "mutual participation in an enterprise." Dif-
 ferent schools of Muslim law prefer either one or the other, but in the
 Geniza records they seem to be equally frequent and not related to a
 specific country or period. In the queries addressed to Maimonides the
 two terms are used interchangeably. We render these terms with
 commenda, since this medieval form of business cooperation in Europe
 was essentially the same as its Muslim counterpart and was perhaps
 derived from it. In the parlance of the Jewish courts, the commenda
 was called qirii<J al-goyim "mutual loan according to Muslim law"
 and was sharply differentiated from the qirii<J betorat '-isqii, "a
 qirii,<J in form of an 'isqii," the Jewish partnership, in which the manager
 received two-thirds of the profits but was also responsible for losses.3
 The Jewish 'isqa was less wmmon in the Geniza period than the Muslim
 commenda, as witness the extant contracts and an express statement
 to this effect in Maimonides' Responsa.' The 'isqa was less practicable.
 A merchant who invested work but no capital often did not have much
 money. Consequently his responsibility for losses was of only limited
 value.
 In a number of legal documents referring to partnerships the man-
 ager who also invests capital, albeit sometimes small or merely nomi-
 nal in amount, receives special benefits in cash or otherwise, which are
 described as "compensation for his toil and work," or "for his work and
 food." Since these expressions are invariably in Hebrew in the midst of
 an Arabic text, it stands to reason that a contract according to Jewish
 law is intended although Muslim law has similar provisions. The
 Mishna provided these benefits in certain partnerships in order to
 avoid their use for veiled taking of interest and usury. 6 As we shall
 presently see, some other aspects, such as the trustworthiness of the
 partners and the oath incumbent on them, are also expressed in He-
 brew terms. It is not always evident which law, Muslim or Jewish, gov-
 erned a contract, nor which school of lawyers within one of the two
 religions was followed. We are perhaps right in assuming that local
 custom ("the merchants' law") and the specific aims of the contractors
 in establishing the partnership were largely responsible for the condi-
 tions laid down in a contract. Both Muslim and Jewish laws, with a.
 few exceptions, leave to their followers considerable freedom with
 regard to the legal form of their economic undertakings, and Maimon-
 ides' Code states with specific reference to partnerships that customs
 current in a country are binding, so long as no stipulations are made to
 the contrary .6
 As the Geniza records tells us the following points had to be consid-
 ered in the establishment of a partnership or a commends.
 1. The number and status of the contractors.
 2. The object of the contract and the aims pursued with it (not
 always evident from the definition of the object).







3. The nature and extent of the contribution of the partners (capi-
tal, goods, premises, "or work, or two or more of these), and the specific
rights and privileges granted each partner.
4. The partners' share in profit and loss and their responsibility for
the capital invested.
5. Conditions governing expenditure for the partnership and living
expenses of the partners.
6. Conflict of interest, namely whether or not the partners could
enter into other partnerships involving a similar object while theirs
lasted.
7. Whether or not the partner(s) who managed the common busi-
ness was regarded as "trustworthy witnesses accepted in court" and
was therefore freed from "the oath incumbent on partners" (both
Hebrew expressions). Normally the stronger partner imposed this ex-
emption on the other contractors. Each partner was expected "to exert
himself for the common good, to shun cheating and negligence, to act
as a pious person and a gentleman, and not to put his own interests
above those of his associate," but only in comparatively few contracts
were such stipulations made in full.1
8. The duration of a partnership had to he defined, except in the
case of specific commercial ventures, which were, however, the most
common object of an association.
9. Similarly, it was important to state when the partners would be
obliged to render accounts. Normally this was done at the conclusion of
the partnership, hut in many cases interim accounts were stipulated or
promised.
 10. Finally, special conditions of any kind could he included.
 Normally a contract, let alone a letter referring to a partnership,
does not contain all the points enumerated. Much was left to current
practice or to oral agreements, and that incompleteness often led to
lawsuits. Such lawsuits appear in queries submitted to legal authorities
as well as in actual court records.
 It has been observed that Muslim lawyers wmally envisage partner-
ships only between two persons.8 This should be viewed merely as legal
idiom. In reality, as the Geniza shows, partnerships among three or
four (or more} associates were as common as those heiween two. We
came upon contracts among four and five persons while discussing
industrial cooperation. In an account written by Nahray b. Nissim in
1058, two out of five partnerships listed were among three merchants,
one of whom participated with a share of only one-eighth.' In a letter
to Nahray mention is made of a partnership to which two persons each
contributed one-third and two others each one-sixth of the capital.1° A
query submitted to Maimonides speaks of a partnership consisting of
at least three investors and one manager.11 Partnerships of three or
four members occur over and over, as we shall see.
The partnership situation was the same for Jews and Muslims. Two







 Jewish brothers in Qayrawin had a partnership with a Muslim in
 1048.12 Several instances of four associates, one of whom was a Muslim,
 are referred to in Mediterranean Society, Volume II, chapter vii, where
 the legality of the conclusion of a partnership betwe~n the followers of
 the two religions is discussed.13
The commonplace objective of a partnership is that where the two
 contractors put identical sums (200 dirhems in the· example here) "into
 one purse," "sell and buy, take and give and do business with their
 capital and their bodies" and share profit and loss, as well as manage-
 rial costs and living .expenses in equal parts.u Participations in busi-
 ness ventures with different shares are of similar frequency, while
 profit, loss, and expendiiure are divided in proportion to the invest-
 ment. In a court record from July, 1162, one partner contributed 55 out
 of a total of 150 dinars and shared one-third of the profit and loss,
 while each partner had the right of unilateral disposition of the com-
 mon money kept in a leather bag. The two were merchants engaged in
 the sale of silk in the Egyptian Rif, each of them traveling to a
 different town at a time. 15 A Tunisian merchant had a one-sixth inter-
 est in a deal of lacquer sent from Egypt, having a total worth of 365
 dinars, and five-sixths in a shipment of indigo and sal ammoniac
 dispatched from the same country. We saw cases of this kind in the
 discussion of partnerships consisting of more than two persons. The
 division of such shipments among the partners required great expert
 knowledge and used to be undertaken either by the receiving party, if
 he had sufficient authority, or by a common business friend in the
 presence of at least two other acquaintances serving as witnesses, or by
 a local representative of merchants. 18
Newcomers to a partnership received a smaller share in the profit
 than the experienced members who were already established in the
 business. A somewhat out-of-the-way example may serve as an illus-
 tration. In January, 1061, two men, father and son, were confirmed by
 the representatives of the Synagogue of the Palestinians in Old Cairo
 as washers of the dead and admitted a third partner, who was to
 receive only one-fourth (not, as one would expect, one-third), of all the
 fees and benefits accrued. 11
Sometimes the reason for the seemingly unequal treatment of the
 partners can only be surmised. In a partnership in a store of drugs, the
 two contractors share the work, profit and loss, as well as Jiving
 expenses, but one pays in 100 dinars and the other only 50. As the
 latter bore the by name "the druggist," we assume that only he had a
 license for the store or even that the very purpose of the contract was
 apprenticeship. This surmise is corroborated by the fact that the
 contract was made effective for two years, a period quoted in another
 document as sufficient for apprenticeship.18 Another contract in a store
 of drugs, to which each of the two partners contributed the very
 considerable sum of 300 dinars, states, as-expected, thl\t profit and loss







 were to be shared "equally in halves," but contains also the following
 stipulation: "When Mr. Amram [the other partner] is in town, he may
 join me in selling and buying, as it pleases him." It is not made known
 why Mr. Amram should receive an equal share in the profit, since he
 was not supposed to contribute work regularly. Evidently his jah, or
 social position, made a connection with him profitable.19
Benefiting from the prestige of one's associate is expressly mentioned
 as the aim of a partnership in an interesting document in which a local
 notable castigates two of his partners, brothers from a foreign country.
 He was supposed to receive half the profit and the two brothers the
 other half. The turnover from the store had been 4,000 dinars during
 fifteen months, while every month 30 dinars had been paid for "the
 debt on the store," to whom-is not stated. The notable had received,
 besides 10 dinars in cash, only half a dinar per week (the two brothers
 together got the same sum). Since he implies improper management by
 the brothers, his "sitting in the store," which was regarded as vital for
 the brothers' success, most probably was not very regular, that is, more
 often than not he did not work for the partnership. It is not excluded
 that the monthly debt was paid to none other than the complainant.20
The prominence of imponderables and the great latitude in the con-
 cept of the objective of a partnership are well illustrated by a contract
 concluded between 'Ulla, one of the two trustees of the court referred
 to above (p. 158) and a man called Yal)ya. The partners invested 150
 and 120 dinars respectively. Out of the total of 270, one received for his
 management 200, the other 70. Profits from all transactions made by
 either side would be divided in equal shares, and the same applied to
 any profit made by either side with capital received from third persons
 on commission, in partnership, or on commenda, while losses would be
 borne only for goods bought with the capital belonging to the partner-
 ship. Each partner had to restitute the capital handled by him in-
 cluding goods perished on transport by land or on the sea. The partner-
 ship was to last for two years. It was successfully concluded, for the
 document referring to it is a release in which the partners absolve each
 other from all obligations and responsibilities which might have re-
 sulted from their former connection. As we shall see later on, 'Ulla and
 Yal)ya. continued to have close mutual business relations of a very
 complex nature, but with less satisfactory results. 21
Partnerships, in addition to those involving cooperation with equal
 or proportional responsibilities, or those based on imponderables such
 as the benefit from a partner's social position, served two vital pur-
 poses. They provided a dignified form of emplo:vment and the most
 popular means for the investment of capital. These two objectives
 sometimes appear combined in one and the same relationship.
In an agreement made around 1080, a person known from other
 documents as working in the caliphal House of Exchange invests 500
 dinars in a banking business while his junior partner contributes only







58, yet shares in profit and loss at a ratio of ½4 • He is otherwise
entirely subordinate. The senior partner has full disposition of the
common capital and directs and supervises all actions of the junior.
The latter has no right to sign promissory notes and has no say with
regard to the granting of loans. The senior is exempt from the obliga-
tion of the oath of the partners. This contract is a typical example of a
partnership with employment and possibly also apprenticeship as its
main purpose.22
 A similar relationship, but without the element of apprenticeship, is
apparent in an agreement where one partner invests 600 dirhems in a
store of drugs and juices and the other only 20. The latter "sits in the
store" and does the selling, the former does the buying. Profit and loss
are shared equally, but the storekeeper receives a weekly payment of 9
dirhems, while his partner "takes out" only 4. The difference is re-
garded as compensation for work. The investor most probably was a
wholesale merchant in drugs and juices who had similar contracts with
a number of storekeepers. 23
 Mere investment was intended in such connections where the conduct
of the business was entirely in the hands of the manager. There was no
difference in this respect between investments in a store or in a specific
business venture, such as the purchase, transport, and sale of goods.
Samuel b. Judah Ibn Asad, a notable appearing in many documents,
entrusted in 1152 linen and other textiles worth 1,000 dinars to two
partners, each of whom contributed 50 dinars. The two were to sell
these goods and buy others in the cities and the Rif of Egypt for the
duration of one year, at the end of which profits and losses would be
equally divided between the investor, qii~ib al-mal, as he is called in
the document, and the two managers. In a judge's note from the summer
of 1156 on "a contract of partnership" for the conduct of business in
Upper Egypt the capitalist pays in 160 dinars, the manager 10, the
profit is again shared in equal parts (the note does not say anything
 about losses), while the agent "receives preferential treatment" consist-
ing in the payment of half a dinar (per week, seep. 177, below). In a
 contract for the renewal of a partnership we see a merchant putting 80
 dinars into a store for an additional year and sharing one-third of the
 profit or loss. With regard to these the manager was freed of the oath
 of the partners, but in case of damage to the capital, he had to prove in
 court that an act of God was involved. During the course of the year the
capital could not be retrieved. If the investor wished to withdraw his
 money at its termination, he had to grant "a period of waiting" of two
 months--a common term in any business transaction. 24
 Finally, partnerships could fulfill a function similar in certain re-
spects to that of a modem insurance company. In a contract made
during the last third of the eleventh century, a scholar gives to his elder
minor daughter 50 dinars and to his younger daughter 25, in order to
provide them with a trousseau when they reached maturity. Mean-







 while, the money was entrusted to a merchant in the form of a
 partnership to which he contributed only 5 dinars. Profit was to be
 shared equally by the merchant and the girls, while the former had to
 bear ¾2 and the latter '½ 2 of the losses. The capital itself was
 insured, being "a deposit of the court," for which the highest possible
 form of security had to be given. The father had no right to demand
 the money back or to interfere in any way in the operations of the
 merchant. In case anything happened to the latter, the rabbinical
 court, in consultation with three experienced elders and the person in
 whose guardianship the girls would be at the time, would hand over the
 money to another partner. The difference between the amounts given to
 the two daughters cannot be explained by the Jewish law of primogeni-
 ture, which applied to males only, but certainly had its reason in the
 difference in the age of the two girls. It was expected that by the time
 the younger girl attained maturity, the merchant would have added so
 much profit to her capital that it equaled that of her sister, who, it was
 supposed, would have married many years before.25
 A few additional instances of the contributions of partners, their
 participation in profit and loss, and their responsibility for the capital
 invested illustrate the wide range of variations prevailing in this matter.
 In a partnership covering export and import between Egypt and Syria,
 the manager provided approximately one-fourth of the investment
( 124-½ dinars out of a total of 484-½, while the capitalist contributed
 360), but shared profit and loss on equal terms with his partner.28 In a
 similar undertaking, a business trip to Syria, four partners intended to
 travel together. One of them, when prevented by illness from joining
 the company, stipulated that losses would be borne by himself and his
 partners in equal shares, while the partners would take ½2 more in
 profit, the difference being regarded as compensation for their work and
 their living expenses.21 A merchant traveling to Sicily in the spring of
 1058 received from an Egyptian business friend Oriental spices and
 aromatics worth 186-% dinars with a view to selling them on his native
 i!3land on condition that he shared one-third of profit and loss. The
 contract is expressly called "partnership." 28
 Actual contracts according to Jewish law, which give the manager
 two-thirds of the profit but make him responsible for losses, have been
 found, although they are rare. 29 The Muslim commenda is more com-
 mon, in which the manager receives only one-third the profit but is not
 responsible for losses; and there are reported instances were the losses
 were not borne by the manager. In one case, the investor lost almost 50
 out of 70 dinars entrusted to an overseas trader, but was convinced by
 "the elders of the community" that he had no claim against the man.30
 In another case, a "partnership" amounting to one thousand dinars,
 losses were incurred, whereupon the manager claimed to be not a
 partner, but the bearer of a comrnenda, and therefore not responsible
for the losses.81 A middleman who brought about the connection be-







tween the capitalist and the managers could become a member of the
partnership. In a query submitted to Abraham Maimonides we read
about a store of drugs in which 368 dinars were invested. The capitalist
received one-half the profit, while the middleman and the managers
each got one-sixth, the managers having an additional claim on a daily
or weekly remuneration. 32 The amount of the remuneration is not
indicated because it was irrelevant to the litigation that prompt.ed the
query. In other documents the sums mentioned affecting persons "sit-
ting in the store" are low, varying from 5 dirhems per week to half a
dinar (about 18 dirhems at that time). This fact may have its source in
the stipulation of Jewish law that the manager receives "the wages of
an unemployed," which are defined as the sum a person would consent
to accept in order not to have to work.33 In one contract, the partners
receive their wheat and wine in addition to half a dinar per week.34 In
 another, only the investor (of 200 dinars) receives wheat, wine, and
other living expenses except those on his house and school fees for his
 boy.s5
In business ventures of limited scope, the manager received his living
 expenses in addition to the expenditure on transport, customs, and
 so on, "out or the midst" (the partnership). This was common Muslim
 law, as well as a practice reflected in the Geniza records.38 In an
 account written in 1047, the living expenses (the Muslim term nafaqa)
 amounted to 22-½ dinars for 14 months, that is, somewhat less than
 half a dinar per week (more exactly, 0.381 dinar) .37
There were also partnership agreements where the manager received
 one-third the profit but bore the expenses himself. This usage explains
 why we find in one court record the investor claiming that the expenses
 had to be borne by the manager, while the latter declared that they
 were on the account of the partnership. In another legal document it
 was first stipulated that the transport of the goods was on the account
 of the traveler, and was later on changed to the condition "all expenses
 to the midst." Both records concerned the transport of corals, the first
 from the West to Egypt in 1085, the second from Egypt to Jedda, the
 port of Mecca, in 1036.38
In one case we saw the managing partner indemnified by receiving ½2
 more of the profit, while losses were divided equally. Another document
 refers to a similar arrangement granting the merchant doing the selling a
 preferential share of ¼- We also had an agreement in the opposite di-
 rection, namely with the profit shared equally, with the manager bearing
¼ less of the loss.311
It was customary for a merchant to engage in a number of partner-
 ships even in the same commodity, or for him to take that commodity
 from one business friend on commission and from another on partner-
 ship. We read about such connections with others even in letters to
 most prominent merchants.4° There were limitations in this matter
though. A Tunisian merchant writes to the husband and son of his







sister in Egypt: "All I bought this year is in partnership with you. I
did not send anything to anyone else." 41 In an unfortunately much-
mutilated document of the dissolution of a partnership the manager is
permitted in the future to trade with others in the merchandise con-
cerned. By contrast, in a tripartite contract a partner undertakes,
under heavy oath and under a penalty of 10 dinars, not to do any
business in any form in any type of silk (evidently the object of the
previous partnership) or to conclude any partnership connected with
that commodity. Against this, his former partners release him from
claims that might result from their former business connection. More-
over, one of them now associates with him in tax-farming three Egyp-
tian villages. 42
 As to the duration of partnerships, joint specific ventures lasted as
long as their natures-and the goodwill of the manager-warranted. In
the case of a partnership in ambergris transported from Tunisia to
Syria and exchanged for brazilwood, which in its turn was sold with
great profit to European merchants, the operation lasted ten years,
when the investor finally brought the manager to court.4 s The standard
period of a partnership, even in a store, was one year, after which it
was renewed, if so desired. Special circumstances could induce the
parties to contract for two years or for a stretch of time appropriate
to the nature of the relationship, as in the case of the capital destined
for the trousseau of two minor girls described above. But even there,
where the provider of the capital had relinquished the right to reclaim
it, accounts had to be submitted to him every year. In joint business
undertakings that often lasted longer than one year, accounts were
made every year. 44
 Special conditions attached to a contract of partnership are very
prominent in the Geniza records. "I have heard that my partner has
gone to Damascus, although I have instructed him not to leave Ramie
and that all his selling and· buying should be done through Siba', the
representative of the merchants"-we read in an old letter.n In a
contract written in 1116-1117 the two investors allow the manager to
do business in the Egyptian RH and the three seaports Damietta,
Tinnis, and Alexandria, but nowhere else (which probably referred to
the capital, where the two were active themselves) .'8 In an agreement
made at approximately the same time, the manager undertakes to
confine his sales and purchases to Aleppo and Antioch and other places
in northern Syria and to sell only for cash, since these were conditions
imposed on him by his two partners who provided the capital.47 When a
manager acted against such stipulations and something happened to
the principal, he was held responsible for the whole loss.48
 Sometimes it was expressly stated that the managing partners were
free to act as they saw fit.49 Where no such statement was made, it was
taken for granted. "I have no right to raise objections against you"
writes a merchant in Sicily to his partner in Egypt, "with regard to







purchases made by you for our khulta, just as you have no right to
remonstrate against my actions here." In a previous letter, the same
merchant had suggested to his friend that one-third of their common
capital should "travel," that is, be invested in overseas transaction~,
while each of the other two thirds should be used by the two partners
respectively for local dealings. The proceeds from the writer's own
consignments sent from Sicily to Egypt should be divided, half going
to the khulta, and half to the sender's own account. 50 It must have been
usual in both commercial and industrial partnerships that one con-
tractor granted the other a loan, which the latter wholly or partly in-
vested in the common undertaking. We have such contracts from
the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. In the last one, only
600 of the 3,000 dirhems received as a loan were put into the partner-
ship.111
 The termination of a partnership was as complicated as its initia-
tion. This example, involving a store of drugs, illustrates. One of the
partners was a "druggist" and son of a "druggist," the second was the
son of a money assayer, while his own profession is not indicated. The
partnership was dissolved under the following conditions:
 1. The druggist receives from his partner 14 dinars, payable in
monthly installments of 1 dinar.
 2. He acknowledges the assessment of the value o'f the store, which
 was handed over to him.
 3. He will pay debts on the partnership to the amount of 800
 dirhems. Liabilities in excess of this sum will be borne by the two
 partners in equal shares.
4. The assets of the partnership belong to the two in equal shares
 and both will cooperate in collecting them.
5. Sixteen flasks (presumably of rose oil), which had not yet been
 paid, belonged to the druggist. Any losses with regard to this item will
 be borne by the two in equal shares.12
Other Geniza. records referring to the dissolution of a partnership
 contain similar arrangements. One, concerning a bank in the Mediter-
 ranean port of Damietta, shows that a 'full six years after the with-
 drawal of two partners, who had invested 600 dinars, the accounts with
 at least one of them had not yet been settled.113
Most court records related to these matters are, however, mere
 releases, that is, statements to the effect that the parties concerned no
 longer had any claim against one another. Such releases, as explained
 in our Introduction (p. 11, above) , are full of legal verbiage but
 contain little subject matter. Clearly, the settlement was made out of
 court, or before Muslim notaries. Express references to the latter are
 found in such documents of release with regard to partnerships. This is
 indeed to be expected. Since the most common form of legally valid
 business cooperation was the Muslim commenda, it is only natural that
 such contracts should be made before a Muslim authority ."







 3. FAMILY PARTNERSHIPS
 In September, 1112, a merchant and his nephew (the son of his sister)
 appeared before a notary in Old Cairo to renew a family partnership,
which had existed for years but had lacked legal sanction. Each of the
two had been used to making transactions and concluding contracts
without the knowledge of the other, with the commitments sometimes
incurred in the name of both and sometimes only in the name of the
 contractor. The two relatives now made accounts, assessed their prop-
 erty, and laid down rules for their future cooperation. It is intensely
instructive to observe the conditions under which this informal relation
was converted into a formal partnership. The joint capital, 3,750 dinars,
a very respectable sum, belonged to the two in equal shares. The geo-
graphical scope of the business was to be vast, comprising the West,
that is, the Muslim countries of the Mediterranean west of Egypt,
Egypt itself, and "Yemen," a term used to encompass the whole trade
route to India. The absence of Palestine, Syria, and the J.Iijiz from
this list was the result of the state of insecurity created in those coun-
tries by the advent of the Crusades. As previously, each partner was
entitled to act independently of the other, while any commitment in-
curred by one would be binding on the other, irrespective of whether a
particular document or transaction was made in the name of both or
only of one of them. All profits obtained by any transaction made by
one of the two likewise belonged to the partnership. Unlike previous
usage, certain personal expenses would not be borne by the common
purse. Since the uncle had married with money provided by it, though,
the nephew would have the same prerogative when he married. No time
limit was set to this contract.1
 Thus, family partnership was characterized first by its comprehen-
siveness. Any profH accruing to the relatives from any work done by
them belonged to the common purse. Such a stipulation was found by
us in a regular partnership only once, but there the contract was only
for two years, and there were other restrictions attached.2
 Secondly, the family partnership was endowed with overriding legal
power. Whatever form a partner's transactions took involved the other
members equally. In conformity with this legal situation we read the
following in the will of a merchant who had made his brother sole
executor and guardian of his children: "Everything that is registered in
my name or the name of my brother or that of us two or in the names
of our children, as well as all the pieces of jewelry for the little ones
[i.e., the girls for their future trousseaus I, and the real estate, the
sheep, the orchards, and their rights of tax-farming will be divided in
equal shares-after payment of the items mentioned before-one-half
going to my brother and the other half to my children." Naturally, the
dying man would have had no right to dispose of the property of his







 brother and his brother's children had not the overriding power of
 family partnership been recognized by the authorities with which such
 property was registered (Muslim or Jewish, or, most probably, both).
 The partition of the estate was a legal necessity, for the belongings of
 minor orphans were under the jurisdiction, or at least supervision, of
 the court. De facto, since the surviving brother was entrusted with the
 administration of the property of his nephews, as well as with their
 education (as the will expressly states), he was expected to continue
 the partnership until it could be formally reinstated when the orphans
 came of age.3
In his penetrating study, "Family Partnerships and Joint Ventures
 in the Venetian Republic," Frederic C. Lane makes this general state-
 ment: "In most societies, at most times, it has been the great family
 which by its wealth, power, prestige and presumption of permanence
 has been the outstanding institution in private economic enterprise." 4
 The Geniza world was no exception to this rule. During the eleventh
 century, its trade, which then was still flourishing, was dominated by
 "the great houses." We are able to salvage from the debris of the
 Geniza the family connections of all the more prominent merchants
 engaged in trade. From Fez in Morocco to Al-Ahwii.z in Persia, there
 are letters not only from merchants as individuals, but also as firms,
 many letters being addressed to, or sent in the names of, two or more
 brothers or to or from a father and his sons. It is indicative of the
 decline in the twelfth century of trade among the Geniza people that
 no such addresses have thus far been traced from that period.5
The Tahertis of Qayrawan ideally exemplify a family business for
correspondence about the head of the family (called Barhiin), his four
 sons, and eight grandsons has been traced. One of his daughters was the
 mother of the great merchant Nahray b. Nissim. Another daughter was
 married to one of the Berechiahs, a leading Qayrawanese family, and
 there were several other such connections. The Tii.hertis are repeatedly
 referred to in the plural as "the sons of the Tii.herti," a name designating
 its bearer as an immigrant to Qayrawan from Tahert, Algeria, which
 was first borne by Barhiin's father. Their prominence in the Geniza
 remnants was partly owing to their sheer number and influence. They
 are described in a letter written by an opponent as "one band, united
 by one spirit." Or the preservation of so much material related on them
 may have been caused by accident. A letter discloses that one of them
 was in charge of collections made for the Jewish academy of Jerusalem,
which explains the connection with the Synagogue of the Palestinians in
Old Cairo where the Geniza chamber was located.11
A quick reading of their extensive correspondence conveys the
impression that the second generation brothers Taherti worked to-
 gether on a permanent basis, while the grandsons were connected with
 each other through more informal cooperation, strengthened by part-







nerships contracted for specific business ventures. The brothers divided
their work among themselves in such a way that one or two, but not
always the same ones, stayed in Egypt for several years, while the
others were active at their base in Qayrawan and other places in
Tunisia or in Spain. In a most detailed rendering of accounts for the
year 1024, which was submitted to one of the two brothers then in
Egypt, the assets of each of the latter are kept asunder, while the items
belonging to those remaining in Tunisia are lumped together under the
heading "for your brothers." 7
 At times it is not evident in the Geniza records whether partnerships
between brothers or between a father and a son were of a transient or
of a more permanent character. Such partnerships came before the
court usually a'f ter the death of a participant, when the heirs had to be
satisfied or settlements made with third parties.8 Partnerships between
 close relatives, as among the third generation Tahertis, were definitely
limited to specific undertakings and sometimes outsiders were involved
in them too. 0 In general, it is not evident from our sources how father
and son or brothers cooperated in the trade between the eastern and
western parts of the Mediterranean. We observe them in business on
both ends of the trade route, but the arrangement is not revealed.10
In retail stores and workshops it was perhaps common that brothers
 and even cousins worked and lived together without formal arrange-
 ments. Usually we hear about such cases only when something went
 wrong.11 But close relatives were known to conclude formal partner-
 ships even though it concerned small business. An example for a
 workshop was provided above (p. 89). The following agreement,
 dated 1181, is particularly illustrative. Two brothers conclude a part-
 nership in a store for a certain period (which is not preserved) with
 equal shares in profit and loss. They will live together and eat at one
 table, all the common cost for food to be borne by the store. In
 addition, each receives 1 dirhem per day. If one brother (it seems to
 imply the younger one, a bachelor) does not want to partake in his
 brother's food, he will receive 2 dirhems per day for living expenses to
 the other's 4. The preferential treatment of one brother very likely
 meant that he was the master and the other the apprentice.12
At the root of the family partnership in those days was the mutual
 responsibility in which parents and children and brothers and sisters
 were held by both state and society. We have ample opportunity to
 study this practice with regard to the payment of the poll tax. The
 situation was similar in the world of commerce. When a man became
 bankrupt in Old Cairo, his father, a high community official, had to go
 into hiding. 19 Once a wine merchant traveled to Aden in South Arabia
 after having sold bad wine. His father was brought to court, but could
 not be convicted because, according to strict law, a father was not re-
 sponsible for his son's debts. But "righteous elders" intervened, and the
 old man paid the entire sum demanded by his son's customers.1' Con-







 versely, we find a member of a prominent Damascene family and busi-
 ness firm granting a release to a former partner's sister, confirming that
 she was not responsible for any liabilities resulting from his connections
 with her brother.15 Even more impressive is a magnificently written
 record of March 30, 1052, containing this testimony: when, shortly after
 the murder of the "vizier'' Abu Sa'd, his brother Abu Na~r was also
 killed, claims against the latter were automatically transferred to Abii
 Man~ur, a remaining third brother.16
Joint responsibility was the basis of family partnership, but one did
 not automatically lead to the other. The general impression conveyed
 by the Geniza records is that the members of a family usually worked
 together, but preferred to keep their accounts separate. Tal],ababii.
 wa-tal],iisabii., "love each other, but make accounts with each other" is a
 principle recommended in a saying used all over the Arab world. While
 the existence of big family business is well attested in the Geniza, es-
 pecially for the eleventh century, the complete and long-range pooling
 of resources, as we have found in the document of September, 1112,
 and in the will discussed at the beginning of this subsection, seems to
 have been the exception rather than the rule.

 4. COMMISSION AND AGENCY
"Some fifteen years ago, I happened to travel to Sicily. So-and-so
 confided to me one ~nd a third qintii.rs of indigo, which had cost him
 thirty seven and a third dinars. This was done without any specifica-
 tion. I did not know whether the merchandise was given to me as a
 commends (qirii.g} or a shipment (risiila), and if it was a commenda,
whether it was according to Muslim or to Jewish law. I was certain
only that I had not taken it in the way of purchase on my own account."
Thus writes a man in a query submitted to Maimonides, after he had
been captured by pirates and had ransomed himself with his own
money.1
This passage is a good illustration of the different conditions under
which a merchant could carry with him goods given to him by a business
correspondent. He could take them on his own account-unpaid for as
yet-in which case, of course, he was fully responsible for any loss,
including acts of God. Secondly, he could contract a partnership or a
commends, for which various legal instruments were available, as we
have already seen. Finally, he could handle such goods on the account
of his business friend, so that both the shipment and the profit made on
it belonged exclusively to the other. The Arabic terms used in this con-
nection are risii.la, ''shipment," biga'a, "goods," and kha~ia, "separate
account." The first has just been quoted from Maimonides' correspond-
ence, in which it is common. We shall meet it again. For the two others,
these passages from a letter written in the middle of the eleventh cen-
tury serve as examples: "Nothing is owing to you any more either from
our partnership or from the goods." And a few lines later: "I do not







know to whom this belongs, whether it is from our partnership or from
the [i.e., your] special account." 2
 What remuneration was expected by the traveling merchant? Our
sources show three alternatives. First and foremost, the services were
reciprocal and part of that peculiar informal cooperation already de-
scribed (pp. 164 ff.). Secondly, a merchant traveling to a foreign coun-
try would take along shipments of another merchant as a reward for
being granted a commenda or partnership) or both, covering the same
voyage. This arrangement was extremely common. It is essentially only
a variant of the first. Thus the notable 'Ulla, whom we have already
met as a close business friend of Yal}ya, in 1084 sent the latter to the
Maghreb on a commenda worth 152- 1 ½4 dinars, but confided to him
also a risala of scammony on the same voyage. 3
 The third alternative, which seems to us the most natural, the pay-
ment of a commission, is next to nonexistent in the Geniza records.
A Sicilian merchant, traveling home from Egypt in the spring of 1058,
received from one business friend a commenda worth 186- 1 %4 dinars on
the usual condition that he would receive one-third of the profit, and
with another he concluded a partnership with equal shares. What's
more, the latter entrusted him with 4 bales of flax to be sold in Sicily,
for which service he would be remunerated with an 'umala, or com-
mission.•
 The record, which is a draft, does not say how the commission was
to be assessed-nor do we learn this from the innumerable business
letters and the many accounts that have survived. For in the rare cases
wherein commissions are mentioned, they clearly refer not to the serv-
ices of the merchants engaged in international trade, but to local go-
betweens who secured the goods directly from the producers, or who
served as salesmen. Once, when it was hard to get soap for export in
Tunisia because of government restrictions, an 'umala of % dinar had
to be paid for the purchase of 645 pounds of soap worth almost exactly
14 dinars. The commission represents 2.68 percent of the price. With
this may be compared a brokerage of 2-% dinars granted for mediating
the purchase of 7 bales of flax in Egypt, worth approximately 108 dinars.
These cases are from the eleventh century. A middleman instrumental
in the sale of a quarter of a house for only 14 dinars, in 1139 received
almost 7 percent of the value transferred. (This tallies with the 6
percent cashed by the realtors in the United States today for similar
transactions.)
 The female broker, who handled books (above, p. 161), received one-
third of a dinar in 1179 as brokerage for a Pentateuch that she sold for
7-½ dinars, or 4.44 percent. In 1229, an agent obtained 2 dirhems for
selling a copy of Maimonides Guide for the Perplexed for 30 dirhems
and 1 dirhem for the sale of a medical book worth 10. In the last case,
where we have two items in one document, we see that the smaller the
object the larger the percentage of the commission, which is, of course,







 reasonable. Similarly, a salesman charged with distributing a com-
 modity to a large number of customers expected a higher-than-average
 commission. For at least thirty sales of brazilwood and other Oriental
 commodities made in Sicily between August, 1064, and July, 1065, an
 'umala of 6.5 dinars was paid on proceeds totaling 162.5 dinars, or
 exactly 4 percent. But for the purchase of 7 bales of flax, costing ap-
 proximately 108 dinars altogether in Bu~ir, Egypt, around 1050, a
 brokerage, called samsara, and amounting to 2-1/a dinars was given by
 the buyer, or about 2 percent. 5
The general term ju'l, payment, which occurs frequently in reports
 about transactions, is but an abbreviation of ju'l al-diliila, recompense
 for a broker's work. As expressly stated in more than one document,
 b:rokerage had to be paid by the buyer.8 Therefore, it is mentioned in
 accounts of sales only when, for one reason or another, the seller had to
 remunerate the middleman. Indeed, we find remarks such as "but you
(the seller) pay the ju'l" or "from this, brokerage and discount are to
 be deducted." Similarly, when out of thirty-four sales listed in one
 account, only two contain the item ju'!, we have to assume that the
 brokerage was paid by the buyers, or, since most of these were old
 customers, the services of a middleman were bypassed. Still, in the
 account of a Tunisian novice in the Egyptian trade he was charged with
 a fee for brokerage, for all but one item sold in Alexandria in 1046.7
It is obvious that the amount of the brokerage varied from one type
 of sale to another. This is well illustrated by the following details
 selected from an old account from Tunisia, throughout which the term
 used is ju'l.1
 Value Approximaf.e
Goods (in dinars) Brokerage percentage
Lacquer 85I-½1.8
Indigo, quality I 21-5/24 ½2.5
Indigo, quality II17-¼ 3/8 2.25
Rose marmalade and
Prunus mahakb (a
medical plant)871-11/241.8
Sugar 33-11/24½1.5
 This again points out that the average brokerage for general goods
 was around 2 percent. For more lasting objects, such as books and
 houses, and for distribution to a larger number of buyers, far higher
 fees were paid.
 In many Geniza letters the addressee is advised to sell bil-qism
 wal-rizq, literally "with apportionment and livelihood." This phrase
 has been understood to mean that the writer grants the seller half a
 share in the profit, in addition to living expenses. Nothing could be
 more erroneous. The expression is merely an abbreviation of biqism
 Allah warizqih and similar phrases, which mean "sell for whatever







 price God apportions to us and grants us as a livelihood." In other
 words, the addressee is given free hand to sell for whatever price he
 may obtain.11
 Since merchants used to contract formal partnerships or commendas
 with one and the same traveler to whom they also entrusted goods on
 commission, and since business in general was largely conducted on
 the basis of mutual trust and friendship, it is not surprising that the
 Geniza records teem with cases in which the parties were not sure on
 what conditions they had collaborated, or who made contradictory
 statements about the subject. A characteristic and commonplace exam-
 ple is contained in a court record referring to the notable 'Ulla and his
 business friend Yaf:iya (see above, p. 174): "Mr. 'Ulla made a number
 of claims against Mr. Y af:iya concerning commendas, shipments, part-
 nerships, and accounts, some made in writing and others without writ-
 ten records, as well as about living expenses and profits made on a
 number of journeys to Darnietta, [Alexandria?], the countries of the
 West and other places." For instance, 'Ulla declared that the sum given
 to Yal).ya on his trip to the West (above, p. 184) was a commenda, on
 which the agent would receive a third of the profit but had to bear the
 expenses. Y af:iya claimed that it was a partnership to which he had
 contributed 50 dinars with the stipulation that the profit would be
 shared equally the expenses covered from the proceeds. Against
 this 'Ulla argued that the partnership referred to by his opponent was
 concluded only with regard to a trip to Damietta, not to the West.
 Such vagaries were not confined to the merchant class. When the
 mother of Ibrahim II, the Aghlabid ruler of Tunisia, was sued by two
 merchants for a debt of 600 dinars, she argued that that sum was in-
 cluded in a previous deal with the claimants, which had been settled.10
Regular fees were also paid to brokers and market criers and to the
 representatives of the merchants. We turn now to this important office.


 C. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MERCHANTS AND
HIS WAREHOUSE
 Friendship and mutual trust, the very foundations of Mediterranean
 commerce during the High Middle Ages, were not sufficient to meet the
 needs of a developed economy. Foreign trade could not be based on
 personal relations alone. The gap left by informal cooperation was
 filled by the professional representative of the merchants, the wakn
 al-tujjar, rendered in Hebrew as pequl ha-so'JJarim, abbreviated to
 wakil and paqid, respectively. The nature and development of this most
 important office, about which we read next to nothing in the literature
 of this period, is richly illustrated by the Geniza records. It is significant
 that one of the recently discovered Judea-Persian tombstones from







 Afghanistan commemorates an "upright elder" bearing the Hebrew
 title paqid (dated 1173) .1
The representative of the merchants had three different, though
 interconnected, tasks. As his title indicates, he was primarily the legal
 representative of the foreign merchants. A person who had a claim
 against a tardy debtor in another country would give a power of at-
 torney to a friend traveling or living there to represent him in court.
 Such a representative was called wakil, and many statements dealing
 with authorization of this kind have been preserved. But not every one
 had a friend willing or able to represent him in court in a foreign
 country. In this case, he would apply to a professional wakil. The
 Geniza shows that even when a merchant living in a distant country
 had close and influential friends in Old Cairo, he would sometimes
 find it advantageous to confide his cause to the wakil tujjar (all the
 while asking a friend to watch that the wakil attended properly to the
 matter) .2
This origin of the office of the representative of the merchants in the
 practice of law explains why quite a number of the Muslim wakils
 mentioned in the Geniza were qadis, or judges, and, as we see from the
 contexts, did not only bear the title, but actually held the office. Such
 a combination of qadi and wakil seems to us to conflict with the im-
 partiality expected from a judge. The Muslim qadi was, however,
 largely an administrator, a local ruler, who needed economic power in
 order to give weight to his juridical and other decisions. These matters
 are explained in detail in the section on the Muslim judiciary.•
The representative's second task involved storage. This problem, as
 far as is evident from the Geniza, was solved in four different ways.
 One asked a friend to take delivery of one's shipments and to deposit
 them in his own store. Or, when arriving in the foreign country, one
 rented a qa'a, or ground floor of a house, which served the newcomer as
 storage room, office, and living quarters. There were also warehouses,
 called makhzan tujjar, and caravanserais, where one could leave one's
 goods. (The merchants of the Geniza records seem not to have liked to
 stay in a caravanserai.) However if a merchant did not accompany his
 goods and had no engaging business friend, he would store his ship-
 ments with an agent who also could take care of the marketing. This
 double function of storage and marketing was fulfilled by the diir al-
 wakiila, "the agency house" of a representative of the merchants. A
 proper wakil had to have a dar, and he is sometimes referred to as ~ibib
 dar al-wakala, "proprietor of an agency house."'
With this a third and most vital task was combined. The wakil al-
 tujj ar served as a depositary for the merchants and a neutral arbiter
 between them. When a participant in a partnership went abroad, he
 would not (or not in all cases) send the goods purchased there to the
 store of his partner, but to a wakil, who would either store or sell them,







 as advised. The money thus obtained could be left with him as well.
 Partners would confide in him their common goods for sale. We often
 find in letters the request to have the writer's merchandise sold in the
 house of the wakil, and in one case we read about a commenda stipulat-
 ing that the traveling partners should sell (in Ramie, Palestine) solely
 through a well-known local paqid.6
Since the warehouse of a wakil was a neutral meeting ground for the
 merchants, it served them also as a bourse. One would form there a
 IJ,alqa, or "circle" for auctioning, for example, some loads of antimony
 imported from Spain. Or one offered for sale, 'ar<f,, flax brought to the
 capital, or cheese from Europe. An important document, dated 1141,
 states that offers for the conclusion of a partnership were binding only
 when they were made in a dar wakala, or a merchant's warehouse, but
 not anywhere else. This clearly indicates that these places had some
 official standing. It is also natural that there was a notary in the wakil's
 warehouse so that commercial contracts, such as the conclusion of
 partnerships or commendas, could immediately receive their proper
 legal form. A letter in Arabic characters is addressed "to the dar al-
 wakala, to be delivered to the illustrious and noble qadi Sadr al-Din,
 who acts in it as witness [i.e., notary] .11 6
How did one become a representative of the merchants? Ibn Muyas-
 sar, the Egyptian historian, while reporting the execution of the chief
 justice of the country (who was his namesake) in October, 1136, gives
 the following details about the latter's antecedents. After the terrible
 years of famine and disturbances, when order- was restored (around
 1075) by Badr al-Jama.Ii, the caliph, with a view toward reviving the
 economy of Egypt, ordered him to bring from Syria people with capital
 and wealth. Among these was the father of the future chief justice, who
 was a very rich man from Caesarea, Palestine. He was appointed
 preacher (in the caliphal mosque) "and opened in Mii;;r [Old Cairo] a
 dar wake.la, in which he stayed until his death." 1 Great wealth and an
 official position enabled the newcomer to the country to become a
 representative of the merchants.
In another passage by the same historian we read the following: "In
 this year [1122/1123 A.D.] he [the vizier al-Ma'miin Ibn al-Bati'ibi]
 ordered the erection of a dar wakala in Cairo for the merchants arriv-
 ing from Iraq and Syria." Cairo, we remember, was the new city built
 for the use of the government, while Old Cairo, or Fustat, was the busi-
 ness center of the capital. Obviously, the new vizier wanted to divert
 some of the business to the seat of the administration.8
The semiofficial character of the dar waksla is evident in the two
 cases described. It is underlined by the titles borne by two Jewish
 representatives of the merchants, one living in Fatimid and another in
 Ayyubid times, which designated them as persons serving the govern-
 ment." When we read in a letter from Old Cairo ''So-and-so is today a
 wakil tujjir in partnership with Abii Mul.)ammad," we get the impres-







 sion that some official confirmation, or at least license, was necessary.
 The cooperation of a Jew and a Muslim in a dar wakala had practical
 advantages and is found elsewhere.10
Uniformity should not be expected in the ways of becoming a wakil
 tujjar. If someone was influential and skillful enough to represent many
 foreign merchants in court, and wealthy enough to keep a large ware-
 house, he would apply for a license and, if he was on good terms with
 the proper officials, would get one. There must have been many inter-
 mediary stages between the regular well-to-do merchant who would
 occasionally act both as attorney and as business agent to others, and
 the full-fledged wakil. One such intermediary position was occupied by
 our model merchant N ah.:ay b. Nissim. As soon as ten years after his
 first known arrival in Egypt he seems to have served there as a legal
 representative for his Tunisian countrymen. In a magnificently writ-
 ten power of attorney given to him in 1055 and issued in Qayrawan, his
 name is entered repeatedly in different ink from the rest of the docu-
 ment, which seems to indicate that the mandate was given to him not
 as a personal acquaintance of the mandating party, but as a professional
 legal representative. 11 In countless letters Nahray appears in Egypt as
 business agent, legal representative, and intercessor in public affairs
 for his Tunisian compatriots. But he was clearly no full-fledged, of-
 ficially recognized wakil tujjar. Whether he was preoccupied with his
 banking activities, or with his scholarly pursuits, or whether he lacked
 the capital for a dar waka.Ia, his apparent failure to occupy that posi-
 tion cannot be questioned because of lack of information in view of
 the enormous mass of material on him. I mention this in order to stress
 the point that a "representative of merchants" held some formal ap-
 pointment and was not merely an influential and much-sought-after
 commercial leader.
As in any other vocation, a representative of merchants could succeed
 his father or other senior member of his family. The Geniza details
 several cases of fathers and sons or grandsons, or uncles and nephews
 successively occupying th5s position. We are particularly well informed
about four generations of Jewish representatives of merchants in Aden,
 South Arabia, whose activities, however, fa11 outside the scope of this
 book. 12
In a maritime city a wakil tujja;r could simultaneously serve as
na?,ir, or superintendent of the port, and as tax-farmer of the customs
and other dues. There is evidence that the government made use of the
 office of wakil also for supervision of the foreign merchants. We have
a document to this effect with regard to a funduqani, or proprietor of a
 funduq (fonduk), or caravanserai. But since the term dar wakala
 became practically identical with that of fonduk we may assume that
 the funduqani largely fulfilled the same functions as the wakil. In this
document, which is written in Arabic characters, a Muslim proprietor
of a caravanserai undertakes to transport to the $ina'a (the "Arsenal,"







 the English word is derived from the Arabic), the river port. of Old
 Cairo, all goods that had evaded the payment of dues and all those for
 which customs had to be paid, whether they had been brought to his
 own place or to other caravanserais, or had otherwise come to his
 knowledge. On the blank reverse side of the duly signed official docu-
 ment was written a Hebrew poem. Whether this leaf was abstracted
 from the relevant government office by someone solely in search of
 waste paper is another question.13
Representatives of the merchants were found not only in the larger
 cities and seaports, such as Old Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta, Tyre,
 Tripoli (Lebanon), and Aleppo, but also in provincial towns, such as
 Minyat Zifta. 14 Great business centers such as Old Cairo, Tyre, and
 Aleppo, had several Jewish peqide sol;mrim simultaneously, while for
 the capital of Egypt and Tyre at least we know that at the same time
 Jews confided their wares also to Muslim wakalas. In an ancient He-
 brew letter, probably from the tenth century, greetings are extended to
 all the peqide ha-sol}.arim in Aleppo, and in a document from Damietta
 from the end of the same century a woman grants a release to repre-
 sentatives of the merchants (in the plural). The document is fragmen-
 tary and their names are not preserved. 15 A court record, dated July
13, 1094, states that a merchant had bought goods in Tripoli, Lebanon,
 with capital entrusted to him, transported them to Egypt, and sold
 them in various "houses of the wakils." He had received from these
 houses part of the price, and when the man who had provided the
capital arrived, tbe latter took delivery of what was still found on his
account in the "houses of wakils." 16 An unfortunately very much ef-
faced letter from the beginning of the thirteenth century anxiously
inquires about the state of the wakils and what had happened to them
and how the public and they were affected.11 This query seems to imply
a government action against the representatives of the merchants,
perhaps for evasion of dues and customs as described in the preceding
paragraph.
 We are not yet able to know how the various agency houses divided
the available business among themselves. We just saw how one travel-
ing merchant, working for one capitalist, entrusted the goods he im-
ported to a number of different agency houses. Another traveler to
Syria sent such varied goods as 5 bales of cotton cloth, 6 baskets of
sugar, a bale of gallnuts (and other commodities whose names are not
preserved) to the same dar wakala. To be sure, it belonged to an il-
lustrious qadi whose firm also handled mercury from Spain and lacquer
imported from the Orient.18 Waki1s of this type were as many sided as
the general merchants discussed above, page 153. We may assume that
others dealt with goods of all types brought from one country (as when
items as different as shelled almonds and la.sin silk, both Sicilian
products, were sent to one house) .19 Others again might have been more
restricted in scope.







The wakils must also have differed widely with regard to the power
 and influence they wielded. A wakil who served also as judge or superin-
 tendent of a harbor, or as a farmer of customs, or in several of these
 capacities at a time, was in a stronger position than a newcomer who
 opened a wakala for his compatriots in the foreign country. Sometimes
 we find a wakil styled "trustee of the merchants" too. This title is
 parallel to the legal term "trustee of the court" and designates a person
 with whom cash or valuables were deposited for extended periods, be-
 cause his probity and economic and social position provided the neces-
 sary safeguards. In one case, a representative of the merchants bearing
 that title is entrusted with an estate handed over by the Muslim to the
 Jewish authorities. 20 In another, a widow deposits the belongings of
 her minor daughter with a man "in the qaysiiriyya," or caravanserai,
 who might have fulfilled a similar function. 21 Complaints against wakils
 who detained goods in their dar or failed to settle accounts are not
 infrequent. 22 Everything depended on the specific circumstances of the
 persons concerned. I;Iisday lbn Shaprut, the most prominent leader of
 the Jews of Spain during the tenth century, describes his influential
 position in his letter to the king of the Khazars as follows: "All the
 business and all the affairs of the many merchants who come here from
 all the countries are being arranged through me." This remark clearly
 refers not so much to the office of a director of customs (as assumed
 hitherto), as to that of a wakH tujj ar. As a successful physician I;Iisday
 obtained access to the court. He used the influence he gained there to
 establish himself as a great representative of merchants. The Geniza,
 too, shows persons called physicians acting as wakils. 23
The commission collected by a wakil varied according to the services
 rendered. In two sales of flax made at the same time the wakil received
 almost exactly 2 percent. In those sales, a simsar, or broker, was also
 engaged. In the account, though, the brokerage is as usual lumped to-
 gether with the allowance granted to the buyer, so that it is impossible
 to know its amount and to compare it with that received by the wakil
 in connection with the same transactions. 24
A dar wakala served also as postal address. A merchant writing from
 Tripoli to Old Cairo asks his business friend in the future to send his
 mail to the dar of a repeatedly mentioned wakil in Ramle, Palestine.
 A letter from France addressed to Moses Maimonides was forwarded
 t-0 him through a peq'id sol}ar'im in the Egyptian capital. The "well
 known paqid 11 Ibn Sha'ya in Old Cairo is required in one letter to
 forward all mail arriving from the writer from Damascus to a pro-
 vincial town, and asked in another to deliver a letter immediately after
 its arrival. To be sure, such services were rendered by any store large
 enough to be known to the postal couriers.25
In conclusion, the wakil tujjar, as we know him from the Geniza,
 was not the head of a merchants' guild, which was nonexistent, but a
 representative of foreigners and others who, for one reason or another,







 were unable to attend to their business in person. The ideal man for
 such a vocation '¥as a successful merchant of means who himself had
 come from a fortign country or was the son of such a person, but who
 had lived long enough in his new domicile to become well entrenched
 there and influential. We have read above about the father of the
 future chief qadi of Egypt who had immigrated from Caesarea, Pales-
 tine, and built a dar wakala in Old Cairo. Abu Zikri Judah Kohen, a
 Jewish wakil tujjar in the Egyptian capital, came from Sijilmasa,
 Morocco, and directed the activities of his Maghrebi countrymen both
 in Egypt and on the long trade route to India. In the eleventh century
 we find in Old Cairo a Muslim proprietor of a dar wakala, called
 Al)mad Ibn al-l;larrani, that is, whose father had come from Harran
 in northwest Mesopotamia, a trading center of great antiquity. At the
 same time, the wakil mostly referred to in Ramie, Palestine, was one
 called Ibn al-I;Iulaybi, a derogatory nickname describing his father as
 a native of Aleppo in northern Syria. The very first peqid sol_i.arim
 known to us in Fustat was one Ezekiel b. Mas'ud al-'Aqrabani, from
 'Aqraba in Transjordan from where other people also emigrated to
 Egypt.2s
There must have been some connection between this office of the
 wakil tujjar and the institution of the consulate in the Halian merchant
 colonies in the Levant. It also stands to reason that the shah-bender,
 the provost of the merchants of Cairo in later centuries, might represent
a more developed stage of the wakil tujjar of the High Middle Ages. 27
 A discussion of these problems is best deferred until the publication of
 the Geniza documents dealing with the India trade which contain con-
 siderable material about this characteristic institution of medieval
commerce. 28


 D. BUSINESS PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES
Personal dealings and public sales.-Buying and selling were done
 either by man-to-man dealings, "in sitting" namely in a store, a bazaar
 street, a bourse, or in a toll house, or by public auction through partici-
 pation "in a circle," fi 'l-l}alqa.
The term "sitting" applied to both the vendor and the buyer. "I ar-
 rived in Alexandria on the Muslim holiday and did not find him sitting,"
 that is, his store was closed. "I shall sit with these goods in a store,"
 that is, sell them locally, "or travel with them to Syria." "Let there be
 no other business to you on Sunday morning except sitting in the bazaar
 of the clothiers and picking up all you need/' that is, while shopping,
 the buyer would sit down in the stores where he intended to make his
 purchase.1
Selling at auction could be done by the vendor in person, through a
 broker, or through a representative of merchants who, in turn, would







avail himself of the services of a middleman. "I intend, if God will,
to convene after the Sabbath 'a circle' for these three bales and to sell
them." "As soon as the goods were out of the customs house, I sent two
pieces with a one-eyed young man to the House of so-and-so [a bourse].
'The circle' was formed in the afternoon and he sold. . . .11 "The wakil
who was in charge of the sale of the Egyptian silk sent a broker to the
}:ialqa, but despite the efforts of the latter it brought only five dinars for
ten pounds, from which the fees for the wakil and the broker had to be
deducted." 2
 The eame person would write with regard to the same types of com-
modities (metals and medical plants) once "sitting down for the sale"
and once "standing up for the sale," the latter presumably referring to
auctions. Whether the phrase "standing by" a friend in his purchase
has retained in the Geniza the connotation of physically standing up
is not known. 3
 Once a price had been called out and a buyer had accepted it, the
seller was not allowed to take a higher price later on. 4 Circumstances
decided whether it was advantageous to sell at auction or by dealing
person to person. An Arabic manuscript, we read, could be sold only
in an auction. Europeans once bought indigo "in the circle" and paid
exorbitant prices. 5 But a merchant writes: "Goods sold on the open
market bring nothing," and this seems to have been the prevailing
opinion.ci Property of orphans had to be sold by the court in public. If
such property was immobile, it was offered for sale either daily for
thirty days after the morning and evening synagogue service, or for
two months after the morning service of Mondays and Thursdays.7
 Business localities and seasons.-E ven in our sophisticated society,
business tends to concentrate in certain areas and periods (downtown,
Christmas sales). For various reasons, such concentration was more
intensive in the Middle Ages. We read about streets and markets
named for the types of merchants located there, such as the clothiers,
wool merchants, dealers in secondhand garments, vendors of wax or
of seeds of spices. Occasionally•; the Geniza confirms that the business
alluded to in the name of the locality was actually done there. 8 We have
already pointed out that the assignment of a specific locality to a
profession was by no means carried out rigidly (p. 83). The same ap-
plies to commerce. A letter addressed to a perfumer in the Street of
the Cobblers in Alexandria was not an exception. And in the bazaar of
the flax merchants in Qayrawan silk was traded as well, although silk
came from Spain or Sicily and flax from Egypt.' Certain localities
whose names did not say so served as markets for specific goods. Thus,
the Qalu~ of Old Cairo, a word derived from Greek kalos, beautiful,
was the great bourse for the sale of flax. This is proved not so much by
the fact that the gate leading to it was called the Flax Gate, but by the
numerous direct references in the Geniza to deals in flax made there.
An inquiry about the prices of the Qalus involves seeking information







 mainly about the prices of flax in Old Cairo. Similarly, The Square
 invariably means the Square of the Perfumers, although there were
 other business centers bearing the name square, such as the Square of
 the Money Changers.10
In addition to open bazaars and squares, there were buildings devoted
 specifically to commercial transactions. The qaysariyya (spelled in the
 Geniza mostly with s, and not with ?) a Greek word derived from
 Caesar, betrays by its very name the foreign origin of this institution,
 although the history of the term is not yet known in detail. In Mamluk
 times there were a number of buildings in the Egyptian capital which
were thus called. The Geniza papers of the Fatimid era usually speak
 about the qaysariyya, implying that the merchants concerned normally
 did business only in one such building. "He relies on you that you will
 collect all that is due to him in the qaysariyya." "Be not remiss in the
 collection of all that is still outstanding in the qaysariyya." Two men
form a partnership for work in a "house" (see below) in the qaysariyya,
each contributing 3 dinars, while their entire equipment cost 1-½
dinars. In a partnership with an investor a weaver undertakes to sell
the materials he makes only "to the clothiers in the qaysariyyas," by
which perhaps the "wool qaysariyya" and an adjacent building men-
tioned by a Muslim historian are meant. The Qaysariyya of the Per-
fumers, given as address in a letter written around 1200, presumably
replaced the Square of the Perfumers, so frequent in earlier documents.11
 These illustrations of life in the qaysariyya should be appraised in
relation to references to another such building mentioned even more
frequently in the Geniza, the ?affayn, "the two rows/' presumably a
colonnade with ad,jacent rooms. First of all, the 1;1affayn appears as a
business address. Since we find among the businesses located there that
of the maker of purple cloth 'Ariis b. Joseph, a figure common in the
Geniza papers, the place must have harbored industry as well as com-
merce. Secondly, i~ was a market where a variety of goods, such as
textiles and hides, was offered for sale. Thirdly, continual reference is
made to "the accounts of the ~affayn," to debts to be collected there,
and to agents and bankers. In short it was an exchange in which all
kinds of transactions were made.u
 Those markets and bourses were not merely locations where business
was conducted, but administrative units which were farmed out by the
government for the coilection of dues. The tax-farmer was designated
either as such, q,amin al-suq, or with the more dignified title ~ii~ib
al-silq, "the master of the market," which is pre-Islamic and found in
both Aramaic and Hebrew. We find this designation everywhere 1 for
example, in Old Cairo itself, in Palermo, Sicily, in Tyre, Lebanon, and
in Manbij, Syria. The dues collected by him is discussed in the sub-
section on customs below.18
 Last, but not least, a great variety of "houses," or rather compounds,
are referred to in the Geniza, which intrinsically were toll houses, but







fulfilled also many other commercial functions. These houses were
named after the main or only commodity handled within, such as flax
(in Alexandria and other cities), silk, gems, oil, sugar, rice, raisins, or
almonds (in Old Cairo) , or they bore general names, such as the House
of Blessing in Old Cairo, or the Blessed House in Alexandria, where we
find also the New House, the House of Dues, and others. Since tolls had
to be paid for goods passing through or brought to any city, it appeared
practical to assign to each major commodity one-and in larger cities
several-customs station that served at the same time as distribution
center. The payment of tolls and the storage and sale of goods are
constantly referred to in connection with those "houses." Letters
addressed to them seem to indicate that the merchants concerned had
stores or at least regularly did business there. As in any other customs
house, official money-assayers were stationed in such bourses. "A purse
from the House of Blessing" means a purse bearing the seal of that
office and testifying to the value of the money it contained. Finally,
court sessions related to commerce, such as the handing over of the goods
of a drowned foreign Jew to the local Jewish court by a Muslim judge,
would also take place in such a "house," and an account in the hand of
N ahray b. Nissim repeatedly refers to "the qadi of the Qal~" {see p.
193, above) .14
 Along with these manifold public business centers there were the
semipublic houses of the representatives of the merchants, as well as
the caravanserais which, as we have seen, served as storehouses and
bourses.15
 Market days must have been a regular institution, but are not often
mentioned in the Geniza documents. On market days one might obtain
items generally unavailable in stores and credit was granted one ufrom
one market day to the next one." 16
 The comparatively regular movements of caravans and of convoys
of ships divided the year into seasons of brisk and sluggish business,
and this alternation is vividly reflected in our sources. A month or so
before Passover, when preparations were made for the sailing of the
spring convoys, one expected "the markets to become lively." 11 At
least one hoped for this in the period immediately following the spring
holidays.18 Again in midsummer, when the caravans from Sijilmasa,
Morocco, and from Tunisia arrived in Egypt, and when everyone was
"burning" to buy goods for shipment in the boats sailing in September,
"business was moving ahead." 1' The Muslim holidays were naturally
another great occasion, especially for the textile business. A good piece
of clothing was not to be had in Alexandria at that time, as one letter
reports, for everything was sold out.z0 In a letter from Sicily (or Tu-
nisia) the hope is expressed that "the market will be revived with the
arrival of the army." Not only in modern times has war been conducive
to good business.11
 Transaction procedures.-A transaction was caJied safqa (with ,,







 not ~), or clasping of hands, a Middle Eastern, but also an almost
 worldwide form oi concluding business. Even the sale of a house, re-
 ferred to in a document dated 1143, was confirmed by handclasp. Ac-
 cording to Muslim law, mere oral offer and acceptance were sufficient
 to make any agreement binding. Jewish law required a more formal
 procedure, the so-called "symbolic purchase" (see Med. Soc., Vol. II,
 •· sec. B) .22
 chap. vu,
With some exceptions, transactions of sales were not put in writing.
 It was therefore of utmost importance to have them witnessed by as
 many trustworthy and easily available persons as possible. Both Muslim
 and Jewish laws demand only the presence of two witnesses. For the
 sake of publicity, though, and to secure witnesses in case the trans-
 action was contested af tcr the lapse of some time, or questioned in a
 distant locality, a large number of business friends was usually as-
 sembled for any deal of importance. The witnesses would also mention
 the deal in letters to their correspondents overseas to make it known in
 the country from which one or both parties to the sale originated. The
 witnesses were preferably chosen from the religious community to
 which the parties belonged, because in case of trouble the matter would
 normally come before a court of that community. Transactions before
 a Muslim notary were witnessed by Muslims even when both parties
 were J ewish.23
Written contracts of sale were made only for houses and other im-
 mobile property, for slaves, and for books. A sale by two ladies in
 al-Mahdiyya of a Bible codex worth 20 dinars serves as an example.
 The codex is carefully identified in terms of its former proprietors, and
 the two ladies are described as known "by their faces" to the two
 scribes signing the document. The ladies, presumably cousins, confirm
 their readiness to sell, accept receipt of the payment, and acknowledge
 their and their heirs' responsibility to indemnify the buyer should his
 proprietorship ever be contested. In conclusion, the husbands confirm
 the actions taken by their wives. Contracts in regard to slaves and
 houses are discussed on pages 140-141, above, and in Mediterranean
 Society, Volume IV, chapter ix, section A, respectively. When we
 find in the Geniza a contract on the sale of "one-half of four sacks of
 flax," costing 18 dinars, and 250 pounds of scrap of flax, worth 4 dinars,
 the reason for putting this transaction in writing was the fact that the
 two contractors had been partners in the flax, and partnerships usually
 were made and dissolved before a notary .2'
In many cases, a "favor," samiil],a, or small discount, was granted
 at a sale. Most accounts do not specify the amount, but lump it together
 with the brokerage or simply state that the price mentioned represents
 the sum paid after the deduction of the discount. As far as the samil;ia
 is specified, it fluctuates between 1-1/2 per mill and 2-½ percent. The
 following instances illustrate the widespread custom. The Sicilian
 merchant (referred to above, p. 176) who in March, 1058, carried along







 spices and aromatics worth 186-o/s dinars for a business friend in Old
 Cairo, was instructed by the latter to grant "favors" equaling the
 amount of 1 dinar. This represents about ½ percent. In an account
 from the same city and the same year, 1-1/s dinars were discounted
 from 94-½ dinars, the price of 3 bales of flax, about a 2 percent dis-
 count. A letter from Ascalon, Palestine, written a little later, reports
 that at a time when Egyptian flax was "deep in the earth," that is,
 obtained only modest prices, 3 pounds of flax were given as "favor" on
 a bale (which comprised an average of 450 pounds, but sometimes con-
 siderably less). Thus the reduction here amounts to something between
 % of a percent and 1 percent. In an account frorp. Tunisia written on
 vellum around 1025, a discount was granted only on two out of thirty-
 one bales of Egyptian flax and consisted only in 1-½ and 3-½ per mill
 respectively. Of particular interest is another old account from Tunisia,
 also written on vellum. In one case, only ½2 dinar, a mere trifle, was
 discounted from a sum of 85- 1 %4 dinars, while another item, costing
 21-¾ dinars, obtained a samal}a of over half a dinar, almost exactly
 2-½ percent. In a number of other instances the amount of the reduction
 is, as customary, not ind.icated.25
This account also reveals the nature of the samal}a. After having
 stipulated a price of 44 dinars for 275 pounds of lacquer, the writer
 was forced to grant a discount of half a dinar because some of the
 lacquer had become yellowish. When it was discovered that part of a
 shipment of sugar had been affected by moisture and had coagulated,
 he had to make "a gift," but of how much is not said. 28 In al-Mahdiyya
 when, during a deal in Egyptian flax, a ship carrying the same com-
 modity arrived in the port, the seller granted a discount of 16 from a
 total of 539 pounds. Thus it seems that, despite its frequency, a reduc-
 tion was allowed only when warranted by special circumstances.21
Payment and credit.-Business was normally conducted on credit,
 and to a far higher degree, perhaps, than is the case•in our own society.
 As we have seen, this applied even to retail business. In wholesale, the
 deferment of payment was paramount. When Maimonides was asked
 whether this procedure was not religiously objectionable since it
 involved some sort of veiled interest, he replied that without it most
 livelihoods would come to a standstill.28
As in the medieval fairs of the Champagne, the process of selling
 fell into two quite distinct phases: the sale proper and collection of
 the payment. Normally, a waiting period of two months was allowed,
 whether the merchandise sold was silk, a dyeing stuff, or a perishable
 material, like certain medical plants. A one-month postponement was
 rare. Occasionally, as in the sale of flax or antimony, we read about a
 deferment of four months. In one instance, a sale of wine worth 80
 dinars, a comparatively high sum for such a commodity, a delay of
 six months was granted. A salesman of silk in the little towns of the
 Egyptian Rif had to make the rounds of his customers collecting the







 price a year after his sales. Specific conditions, connected with the
 locality, time and circumstances of the transactions concerned often
 accounted for such differences. In a letter from Qayrawan, written in
 August, 1052, at a time of great political unrest, a merchant provides
 his brother in Alexandria with the following information: "So-and-so
 and so-and-so have been in Susa only since Sivan [June, which means
 three months]; there they sold, and there they collected the payments.
 I have been here in Qayrawan since Shebat [January, seven months]
 and am stuck with the flax dealers in my endeavour to collect from
 them." And, in an earlier section of the same letter: "From the bazaar
 of the flax dealers payments are obtained only after many months. They
 act highhandedly against Muslims, let alone against Jews." A merchant
 of Palermo whose silk was sold in Egypt with a slight loss, but who
 had to wait for payment a long time, writes to his correspondent in
 Egypt: "My real loss is the delay of payment. I would have preferred
 to sell with a heavier loss and to cash the price instead of letting the
 money idle for three years." 29
One gets the impression that the period of collection itself was
 again subdivided: first, a seller "demanded payment," that is, he
 agreed with the buyer what and when he would pay, and later he
 "cashed." This passage from an eleventh-century letter from al-
 Mahdiyya is illustrative: "We sold the linen for 38-42 [quarter dinars
 per one hundred pounds]. When we had completed the sales, we in-
 tended to collect the prices. However, then there happened in the
 country what you know, so that the collection became interrupted.
 After much effort and pressure we were able to demand approximately
 600 quarter dinars out of the total [i.e., an agreement was reached
 that the buyers would pay that sum]. Payment has not yet been made;
 thus I have nothing to report in this respect." 30 Or we read in a letter
 from Old Cairo: "I shall make an effort to cash what is due us on
 the bazaar." 31
Frequently we read that the term of the delay of the payment granted
 was not kept by the buyer. In a rather intimate letter to a business
 friend a writer complains that, in addition to the usual two months
 allowed, the addressee had let pass another five months without pay-
 ing; "thus, you have slaughtered me without a knife [i.e., ruined me]." 32
 In the sale of wine worth 80 dinars referred to above, payment was
 made in five installments, the latest being not six months, as had been
 stipulated, but a full year after the deal. In countless letters the ad-
 dressee is asked to receive payment for the writer. In one, an Alexan-
 drian merchant requests three such collections, one of which was due
from a very prominent banker in Old Cairo, and another payment was
 on a debt of 100 dinars, which the writer was reluctant to demand from
 the buyer "lest he should become angry." He apologizes for troubling
 the addressee with things "concerning which those who are involved
 behave in an improper way." 33
Selling on credit was not entirely disadvantageous for the vendor, as







the price obtained was fixed correspondingly. This is well illustrated in
a curious story reported in a query submitted to Moses Maimonides. A
Jewish agent had sold an unspecified object belonging to a Muslim to
another Jew against cash payment. The proprietor insisted on a delay
of payment, of course, against a higher price. This was a clear case of
taking interest. Still, Maimonides ruled that the transaction was permis-
sible, since the profit was going to the Muslim (and not to a Jew who
was not permitted to take interest from a coreligionist) .34
 For prompt payment, or rather for what the Geniza documents call
"speeding up," a cash discount was granted. For partial acceleration of
the payment, in one case, a little over ½ dinar was discounted on a
price of 29-1/g dinars, from which already 1-¼ dinars had been deducted
for brokerage and "favors," (cf.above, pp. 196 ff.). On a similar price of
29-½ dinars, from which the same items had been subtracted to the
amount of 1-% dinars, a cash discount to the value of 1-¼ dinars was
given for full "speeding up." The goods concerned were bales of flax.
It should be noted that remarks about such cash discounts are extremely
rare in the Geniza papers, and it is natural that no discount was granted
 for commodities which sold well. "Do not sell your caraway for less
than 3-½ [dinars] per qint,ar, cash or credit," writes a merchant from
Alexandria to his friend in Fustat, "otherwise, keep it." 35
Similarly, references to earnest money or down payment are so
 infrequent that the exact meaning of the terms used is by no means
clear. 'Urbiin (or 'arabiin) is, of course, Greek arrhabon, but in the
 passage cited is seems to mean prepayment of the full sum rather than
 earnest money. The passage is contained in the story told on page 167,
 concerning the sudden rise in the price of pepper in al-Mahdiyya, when
 boats with prospective buyers arrived unexpectedly. "They bought it
 for 140-142 [quarter dinars for one hundred pounds] and I took 'urbuns
 to that amount." 88
In another letter from Tunisia, the term qaddam, "to pay in advance,"
 is used. The writer had given 25 dinars on two units of coral strings,
 which he sent on to Egypt, each of which cost 15 dinars. This seems
 to indicate that he would pay the remaining one-sixth of the total price
 only after receiving the payment for the corals from his business cor-
 respondent in Egypt. SimiJarly, a Cairene merchant writing from
 Damascus informs his partner that he had sent 21 camel loads of
 paper, for which he had "paid in advance" 250 dinars, while the trans-
 port cost 5~½ to 6 dinars per load. This would make a total of 115-½
 to 126 dinars for transport, about half the sum "paid in advance."
 Since 50 percent of the original price as cost of the transport on the long
 and arduous route from Damascus to Cairo seems by no means ex-
 aggerated, we may assume that the advance payment on Damascene
 paper, like that made on Tunisian corals, covered most of the sum to
 be paid. Aclditional sources are needed for the elucidation of this
 interesting facet of medieval commerce.11
Anothe~ aspect of payment about which we would like to know more
 /







is its deferment until the arrival of the buyer in his hometown. A
Jewish merchant in al-Mahdiyya allowed his Muslim customer to pay
part of the price of a commodity sold to him in the latter's native city
of Qayrawan according to instructions which he would receive. This
form of payment is regarded as a special case of the transfer of debts
which is discussed in the subsection on banking and finance (pp.
241 ff.) .38
 Business principles and policies.-The guiding rule of commerce dis-
cernible in the Geniza papers was keeping one's capital working all the
time. "Do not let idle with you one single dirhem of our partnership,
but buy whatever God puts into your mind and send it on with the
very first ship sailing." This is the advice of a Spanish merchant writing
from Tyre, Lebanon, to his partner in Old Cairo. As a result of such an
attitude, a rich Tunisian, arriving in Palermo, Sicily, on the eve of
the High Holidays did not find in his office 1 dinar cash, although he
had there goods worth 2,000 dinars. 89
 The very technique of trading was governed by this principle. One
ordered "exchange goods" when shipping a merchandise to another
country, such as wool, flax, and cinnamon to be bought in Egypt against
silk robes, silver, scammony, and saffron sent there. One would "offer"
a Western commodity such as silk "against" an Oriental product such
as tamarind, or buy oil in Tunisia with the money from the sale of
lacquer sent there. But nowhere do we read in the Geniza documents
about outright barter. All transactions are expressed in monetary values.
We must, of course, remember that gold and silver coins were regarded
also as goods in those days and, under certain circumstances, traded
as such. It was therefore quite natural that a merchant in Sicily should
send to his business correspondent in Old Cairo 11 130 dinars for the
four bales of flax, but the silk for the price of the cinnamon." When a
Moroccan merchant asked a traveler from Alexandria to exchange his
ambergris in Spain for silk, the latter, scrutinizing the markets, sold
it instead for gold, explaining, after his return, to the Moroccan's
Cairene friend that his own choice was more advantageous.'°
 "Profit is made through buying well." 41 Therefore, "never buy when
you are in a hurry." 42 This principle refers both to the quality of the
merchandise, about which we read much good advice, and its timing.
One should buy before the prospective buyers arrived from overseas,
but after the pilgrim caravan, which carried much of the Oriental
goods, had returned from Mecca. 43
 The vital question was what to buy. The general principles that
regulated the fluctuation of prices, erratic as they sometimes seemed
to be, were well known to the merchants and are discussed in the sub-
section on commodities and trade routes (pp. 217 ff.). Because of the
slowness of communications it was difficult to keep pace with develop-
ments overseas or even in another city. Since all the countries between
Spain and South Arabia formed one closely knit trading area, changes







 affecting business in one country immediately had repercussions on the
 situation in others. We find, indeed, that the greatest concern of the
 writers of the Geniza letters was business intelligence. The term used
 for it, akhbiir, "information," was identical with that of the intelligence
 services of the government and the police. One inquired first about
 prices, of course, but then also about many other things, such as the
 volume of business, the availability of capital, the movements of ships
 and caravans, the arrival and departure of merchants, the general
 situation in a country, and the safety of communications. While writing
 from Alexandria to OId Cairo one would ask for the prices not only in
 that city, but also for information about Yemen and Syria. In letters
 from Jerusalem inquiries about "the West" would be included with
 questions about prices in Old Cairo and the state of the Nile water. A
 Qayrawii.nese merchant traveling to the Egyptian capital wrote from
 Alexandria that he was unable to proceed because he had to wait for
 the "news from the West." Price lists were attached to many letters
 put regularly at the end so as to provide the latest information obtained
 on the day the letter was sent off .H
As for sale, one tried to be first on the market. The ancient Near
 Eastern maxim; "sell as long as the dust is still on your feet [from the
 journey to the market]" is echoed in countless Geniza letters in which
 the addressee is advised to send a commodity ordered with the very first
 ship sailing, or to sell a shipment announced at the hour of its
 arrival. 45 The government seems not always to have encouraged this
 tendency. An Alexandrian merchant had succeeded with some others
 in sending a certain commodity to Old Cairo earlier than most of
 his competitors. The customs house kept the earlier arrivals for a full
 five days until all the merchants from Alexandria had brought in the
 same commodity. 46 When a consignment arrived late, it would be re-
 ported as unsalable because "it was behind the bales of other people." 47
 Needless to say, there were also situations where "moving slowly was
 preferable." We read instructions, usually accompanied by an explana-
 tion of the reasons, to keep an article until it had attained a certain
 price or to sell it only to regular customers but not to others. When a
 wealthy merchant writes that he had been unable to sell Egyptian flax
 he had imported to Tunisia and Sicily two years before, he certainly
 means that he refused to dispose of it at an unfavorable price, for in
 the same letter he reports about sales of flax realized by him for other
 people. 48
Geniza letters often contain maxims reflecting a wisdom derived by
 merchants from long experience and applicable to any society. "Leave
 one thing for the sake of another," that is, do first things first, or
 renounce even attractive projects in order to succeed in the really
 important undertakings. "In case of doubt, hold back"-and wait for
 further instructions. "Success in business does not depend only on the
 effort made," that is, failure is not always one's own fault. I discuss







more of this material in Mediterranean Society, Volume IV, chapter x. 49
 The merchant's profession was regarded as one requiring high
technical and ethical standards. "Your actions are not those of a
merchant" was a reproach made to a business friend when the writer
was "very angry" with him. 5° Complaints about unethical behavior of
businessmen are suprisingly rare, if we except tardiness in payment,
which must have been a rather common malady. An accusation of the
type found in a court record from 1041-1042 against a prominent
merchant suspected of tampering with the weight of shipments is
absolutely exceptional. Even with regard to customs, cheating was by
no means rampant. The exalted religious postulations addressed by
al-Ghazali, the great Muslim theologian, to the merchants of his time
were not altogether unrealistic. The businessmen of the Geniza re-
peatedly assert that they act for God's sake. "May God reward me for
what I do with my fellow merchants. I do not aspire to a compensation
from men." 51
 Profits and losses.-It is to be expected that our information about
this subject must necessarily be less complete than we would wish. We
have detailed reports about purchases, sales, and prices, but these re-
ports are rarely, if ever, related to one another, and, with respect to pro-
fits, we must be content with occasional remarks. There is some circum-
stantial material that enables us to make certain general deductions.
 Goods sent out of Egypt to Tunisia in spring, 1048, were sold partly
at a profit of "2 dirhems on 1" and partly at "1 dirhem on 1." The
iact is mentioned as an illustration of the truth that in a good year it
pays to import high-quality merchandise.62 In two cases, different from
each other in time, place, and object, 50 percent, or almost 50 percent
was regarded as a good profit, and in a third, 25 percent. The first was
a sale of pearls in Tunisia, early in the eleventh century; the second,
one of brazilwood in Syria made around 1080, and the third, purchases
in Tunisia for sale in Egypt. 58 At the same time, a foreigner in Egypt
describes how he missed an opportunity to get 25 dinars for his mercury
which was worth 19. "Had I luck, I would have made a profit of 6
dinars," or about 30 percent."
 A most detailed account concerning a bale of purple cloth shipped
around 1100 from Old Cairo to Tunisia reveals that that article cost
66-¼ dinars in its place of origin and was sold at its destination for
 264-½ 4 local dinars worth around 94 Egyptian dinars. Freight, dues,
 and other expenses amounted to about 14 dinars, so that a profit of
 approximately 23 percent was obtained.55
These examples are illustrative of itinerant wholesale business. The
 following details concern retailers and local merchants. An immigrant
 to Palestine from the West, who had married a local girl, was given a
 loan of 5 dinars to enable him to open a store in Jerusalem (around
 1050). The store brought a profit of 1 dinar in the course of two months,







which represents a yearly average of 120 percent. Since small sums
like that just mentioned were sufficient for operating a store, it seems
that small storekeepers were indeed able to make gains approximating
the amount of the capital invested. 58
 The greater merchants could not expect such profits. A partnership
between a notable and two young brothers had a turnover of 4,000
dinars in fifteen months, all transactions, as is expressly stated, bring-
ing profit and none loss. They had to pay 30 dinars per month, a total
of 450 dinars, for a debt, and all three together each week received 1
dinar for expenses, which amounts to 65 dinars for the whole period.
Besides this, the notable had taken out 10 dinars on one occasion. Thus
the total income for the partnership was 525 dinars, not a very high
sum for such a turnover. The senior partner claimed indeed that the
profit had been larger. 57 Two partners who bought silk in Old Cairo,
and sold it in the towns and villages of the Egyptian Rif, made a profit
of 12 dinars on sales totaling 101 (including the profit, as the document
expressly states), which is about 13 percent and which seems to have
been regarded as normal.5 8 In a large account dated 1058, the profit
made is indicated in two cases. It was 2 dinars on a sale of lapis lazuli
worth 14, a handsome 16.7 percent of the original price, but only 5
qirats on women's clothing sold for almost 5 dinars, a bare 4 percent
approximately.59
 The scarcity of details about profits is matched by an abundance
about losses. There is hardly a single lengthy Geniza letter bound
overseas which does not contain some such information about goods
either damaged by seawater or other agents, or partially lost by jetti-
soning or totally by sinking. In addition to reports about accidents
caused by uncertain communications we read bitter remarks about the
vagaries of the market owing to many unforseeable factors, such as the
unexpected arrival or nonarrival of goods or prospective buyers and the
general economic situation created through caprices of nature un-
harnessed or of political upheavals, both in the country where the
business was conducted and elsewhere. Throughout this book, and in
particular in the next chapter, telling examples of such occurrences are
described.
 The merchants of the Geniza period met the constant menace of
impending losses in three ways: by spreading the risk, by striving
 for substantial gains, and, in extreme cases, by mutual help. All com-
merce was based on participating in a number of ventures of limited
scope, although it varied widely in practice, some businessmen splitting
up their available capital into a great many small fractions, while the
majority participated in fewer undertakings with more substantial
sums. The latter were the true merchants, known to us by their more
or less extended correspondence, while the former, it seems, mainly
intended to let their capital work without too much risk to themselves. 80







 Reports about losses usually are concluded with the consolation that
God will replace the deprivation suffered. Sometimes we read that
such restitution had taken place simultaneously with the loss. After
reporting the sinking of one bale of flax in one ship and the jettisoning
of two other bales from another, a loss of over 100 dinars, the writer
continues: "However, the prices here in al-Mahdiyya were so good
that you have retrieved a multiple of what you have lost." Most of
the reports on misfortunes are so styled as to suggest that those con-
cerned were indeed in a position to cope with them.111
 If, however, through acts of God or through his own fault, a merchant
found himself unable to meet his commitments, his fellow merchants,
as a rule, would come to his assistance and prevent his becoming bank-
rupt. No type of formal insurance was known to the people of the
Geniza letters, but this readiness for mutual help must be regarded
as a form of it. Such help was extended in many different ways, loans
of capital or goods, without interest of course, being the most frequent
form. In cases of insolvency, the authorities and more prominent mem-
bers of the community intervened and arranged for a settlement, mostly
acceptance of payment in installments of small sums over a long term.
In more serious cases, one-third of the debt was remitted, another
third paid in cash, and for the remaining third payment in install-
ments promised.62 When things got to their worst, namely when, after
the declaration of bankruptcy, the person concerned was unable to
make the payments agreed upon in the settlement, the communal
authorities would assemble the more affluent merchants who would then
make contributions in cash. 63 The declaration of bankruptcy, or "oath
of destitution," would be admitted only after approval by the highest
communal authorities. It seems that when such a declaration was ac-
cepted by a Jewish court, it was regarded as sufficient by the Muslim
judge or police concerned with the case. In a document made out in
Minyat Zifta, Lower Egypt, in 1175, two persons testify to the poverty
of a person who had been condemned to imprisonment for insolvency
when his Jewish debtor had brought him before a Muslim court. The
deposition, which is signed by five, makes sense only if we assume that
it was intended to save the poor debtor from imprisonment." A docu-
ment dated 1161 reports on a collection made for a widow by a well-
known tajir, or big merchant. The contributions ranged from the Nagid
to the slave (and business agent) of the tajir, who gave his share (2
dinars, the same sum as that donated by the Nagid and his master)
on the very day on which the document was written. The participation
of the slave seems to indicate that the dead merchant had been con-
nected with his master by partnership or otherwise. In any case, such
a collection also represents some form of mutual help. 80
 Accounts and bookkeeping.-"! received a letter from Isaac Nafiisi
[ a prominent India merchant] scolding me for having asked him to
write down his account for me. I sent him a letter of apology, re-







 nouncing my demand and promising never to ask him again to commit
 his account for me to writing. This is in fact hypersensitivity on his
 side. You know well how of ten I publicly expressed my gratitude
 toward him while he was away in India and Yemen." 66
"God forbid that I should request exact accounts from you or anyone
 else. I simply wanted to know how much I still owe and what you have
 shipped." 61
 Many utterings such as these seem to indicate that the merchants
 resented giving accounts and viewed requests for them· as expressions
 of mistrust. There is some truth in this assumption. Business coopera-
 tion was regarded as a relationship of mutual trust and friendship, and,
 consequently, did not require minute reporting on the actions taken.
 In reality we see that for most transactions referred to in the Geniza
 letters exact accounts are rendered, and, even when they totaled many
 hundreds of dinars, not a single qirat or even }.iabba, respectively ½ 4
 or ½2 of a dinar, is overlooked. Shorter accounts are included as part
 of the letters, while longer ones are referred to as being enclosed, and,
 in some cases, both letter and account have been preserved.68 Requests
 for statements about specific transactions or the business done during
 a year or more are extremely frequent, although they are often made
 indirectly: one asks the addressee to remind one's business correspond-
 ent of this duty. In one letter the addressee is repeatedly requested to
 urge a third person to make accounts for a fourth. 69
 Accounts were often written on single sheets,7° like letters, and, like
 these, sometimes in a number of copies. This was done for reasons of
 safety or because, in addition to the addressee, other persons, such as
partners, were involved. "Send me your account in three or four copies,
for the peace of my mind depends on the account. Please take the
trouble this year and do what you have failed to do for me during last
 year and the one before." And in the same letter: "'Ata' [the writer's
cousin] sent you an account in two copies about the transactions be-
t.ween you and them [i.e., 'Ata' and partners]." "I sent you one copy of
the account from Sfax and one from al-Mahdiyya. Please report about
all the actions taken in connection with it." Statements about indemni-
ties to be paid after the foundering of a ship were also required to
be submitted in two copies. 71
 Longer accounts, even when sent to a customer, would be written in
booklet form. To be sure, the examples preserved could originally have
been copies retained by the sender for his own use. But we find actual
references to such "account books" as accompanying business letters.
"You mentioned that X [a debt owed to the addressee from the pre-
vious year J was listed in the account book. I looked through the letters
and books that I received and found .... " "I am returning to you your
account book so that you may see for yourself what you have sent me
and what you still owe." 72
 The popular format of such a daftar, or booklet, was narrow; they







 were between 3 and 4 inches wide. Their length varied between a short
 type (5-½ to 6 inches), and a longer one (7-½ to 11 inches). The
 reason for this narrow format was the custom of carrying one's ac-
 counts in one's sleeve in order to have them ready for reference, if
 needed. Thus we read in an eleventh-century deposition in court: "So-
 and-so took a daftar out of his sleeve and said: I do not like to enter
 anything in my daf tar the correctness of which has not been established
 by me." 78
There were, however, also account books of regular book size, written
 either on paper or, in Tunisia only, on vellum. They may represent the
 a~l, or original, retained by the sender, although some are formulated
 as addressing the customer.74
To forestall misunderstanding, it should be noted that not a single
 complete account book from the classical Geniza period has come down
 to us. All we have are loose leaves folded in such a way as to form part
 of a booklet and sometimes also bearing a number. For a long time
 these account sheets puzzled me. They invariably start on the left page
 of the front side-Hebrew and Arabic, we remember, are written from
 right to left-then continue on the two inside pages, and conclude on the
 right outside page. Sometimes the first page, alone or together with one
 or more of the consecutive pages, is the continuation of an account be-
 ginning on a preceding leaf not preserved. After the sequence of the
 pages had been established, there was something even more puzzling.
 All the four-page sheets examined were consecutive. This means that
 they could not have been part of a bound booklet (unless it was the
 center fold). The mystery was solved by the observation (made by my
 wife) that most of the sheets were perforated by two holes not in the
 fold, as would have been the case with a bound volume, but at some
 distance from it. In other words, when they were assembled, the sheets
 were folded and laid not one inside the other, but one above the other.
 This means that such a daftar was not like a ledger in which accounts
 were entered, but resembled a modern file into which prepared sheets
 were inserted from time to time. 75
This technical aspect of the Geniza account books had to be ex-
 plained in some detail because it divulges certain aspects of their
 nature. There are no ledgers in the Geniza, no remnants of systematic
 bookkeeping. What we do have is a great variety of accounts, which,
 when kept together in a daftar, certainly formed an important source
 of reference, but hardly could have served to reflect the financial shade
 of a complex business. In view of the enormous diversification of com-
 mercial undertakings studied above (pp. 153 ff.) we must admire the
 skill (and good memory) of those medieval merchants who were able
 to control far.flung and diversified operations without the technical aids
 at the disposal of later generations.
If we disregard household accounts and short memos, often scribbled
 on the backs of letters received and on smaller or larger scraps of paper,







 the following main types of accounts have been found or are referred
 to in the Geniza.
1. Reports to partners or customers about shipments received, sales
 and purchases made, goods or cash or both shipped, and balances out-
 standing. The basic form of this type is what could be called a "season
 report," namely business done during a summer, from the arrival of the
 convoys of ships in the spring to their sailing in the fall. To this, an
 appendix superscribed "Sold after the sailing of the ships" would often
 be added. Since balances were normally carried over to the next busi-
 ness season, such reports frequently cover more than one year. One
 very detailed but only partly preserved account of monthly sales of
 Oriental products in Sicily covers the period from August, 1064, to
 October, 1065, but at the end the Egyptian partner is requested to do
 what the writer had done, namely to send in a similar account for the
 Muslim years 454-457 (Jan.15, 1062-Dec.2, 1065). The preserved part
 of the document makes it clear that with the rendering of the account
 this specific business relationship, which had lasted for four years, was
 completed. In return for the Oriental products shipped from Egypt, as
 usual, part goods and part gold had been sent back from Sicily.76
2. Accounts for specific connections or transactions, such as a part-
 nership, a sa1e, a purchase, or a transport of goods. A partnership, in
 turn, could be concluded with regard to a specified object, such as a
 certain quantity of silk, or a consignment consisting of different goods,
 such as gold, silver, corals, seven types of clothing, and some smaller
 items, such as almonds. Such specific accounts usually bore super-
 scriptions: "Account of the silk held in partnership with Barhiin b.
 Salil}," or "The Partners:hip with Yeshii'a" (the consignment of differ-
 ent goods referred to above}, "Expenses in Abu $ir" (a detailed report
 of the purchase of large quantities of flax in Bu~ir and another locality
 in Egypt and their transport to Rosetta), "Sale of the Tripolitanian
 and :(lasani dinars" (a long account of a banker to a business friend),
 "Account for the Elder Abu '1-Afral) 'Arus b. Joseph" (about a
 transport of purple cloth from Old Cairo to Tunisia (cf. above,
 p. 202) .77
3. Accounts made for the writer's own use. These are again of two
 basic types, one of a general nature listing payments and receipts,
 purchases and sales, and the other restricted to specific types of goods
 or transactions. Strange as it may seem, these general current accounts
 nowhere bear a date (except when referring to a shipment having ar-
 rived some time in advance of the writing), nor is any other principle
 of arrangement apparent in them. The sequence of the transactions
 listed was obviously regarded by the merchants as a sufficient aid for
 remembering their approximate dat&. It may be that the muwiiyarna,
 daily account or journal, mentioned in some Geniza letters, was the
 name of these current accounts, presumably because they were entered
 day by day, but without noting the date. One wonders whether the







 ruz-niima, which is the Persian word for "journal" and designated a
 governmental account book, lived up to its name or not. In such an
 official journal, most likely, the receipts issued were copied exactly,
 and since these necessarily contained a date, it was automatically re-
 corded. The merchants, though, did not confirm their transactions in
 writing and consequently did not attribute particular importance to
 the exact date. 78
The personal accounts dealing with specific objects differed widely in
 nature. One, superscribed "Pledges for the Cheese," contains eighty-
 one lines listing persons to whom cheese, but also a few other com-
 modities, such as wax, wine, and silk, were sold, mostly on credit of
 course. With regard to four, more complicated transactions, dates are
 provided. Another account is entitled "Details about the Cashing of the
 Draft (suftaja) ," with the word "cashing" emphasized by a stroke
 drawn above it, in the first as well as in the nineteenth line near the
 conclusion of the record of intricate dealings. No dates are given. Of a
 still different type is an account beginning as follows: "God's blessings
 make rich [Proverbs 10:22]. Bought with God's blessings-Praise to
 him-for 'Ariis b. Joseph [the writer of the account]: A Bundle of
 Silk." There follows a specification of the type, weight, and price of the
 silks bought, which amounted to several hundred dinars, as well as a
 note about a shipment and a debt, but again no dates are given.79
Mention must also be made of the accounts submitted by community
 officials, which have been preserved in great numbers and which are
 illustrative of financial practices in general. Their main characteristic
 is the lack of a comprehensive account showing the total revenue and
 expenditure of the community for a certain period. Each individual
 item of revenue was earmarked or used for a specific purpose. Similarly,
 and in .accordance with the principle of the "exchange of goods" (dis-
 cussed above, p. 200), many business accounts note against each sa1e a
 purchase made, carry over the balance to the next twin operation, and
 so on. The bigger merchants show themselves more efficient in their
 accounts than the public administration. They first list all the credits
 and sales, then the debits and purchases, and conclude with the bal-
 ances and an indication of the actions taken or to be taken. 80
Even these methodical and comprehensive records would invariably
 "close the account" at the end of each year. This "closing of the ac-
 count" (a term perhaps taken over by several European languages from
 the Arabic) appear-s to have been more than a mere arrangement for
 convenient reckoning. It seems to have involved an obligation to settle
 one's debts. "I shall demand payment as from the beginning of next
 month. Try to come here too, and collect what is due you from your
 sales, for only four months remain until the end of their [i.e., the
 Muslims'] year." The yearly closing of the accounts was probably
 derived from the practice of tax collection. Taxes were often paid in
 installments, but had to be paid in full by the end of the year, or at least
 shortly thereafter. 81







 The Muslim year, which is about eleven days shorter than a sun
 year, is totally unsuited to serve as a financial year. Still we find it
 used throughout in the Ceniza records, although the merchants would
 sometimes prefer the far more practical Jewish calendar. We find this,
 for example, in the years 1045-1046, when the Muslim New Year fell
 in July, the midst of the business season.82
During the eleventh century numbers were rendered by Hebrew let-
 ters, and in later times also by the Coptic (originally Greek) numerals,
 both of which do not lend themselves easily to arithmetical operations.
 As is well known, during the entire Middle Ages Arab numerals were
 used only by mathematicians in their scientific works, but not by
 Middle Eastern merchants until they learned the great technical merits
 of these numerals from the Europeans. Nowhere in the Geniza accounts
 do we find traces of arithmetical operations. All computations seem to
 have been made by heart-and rarely do we find a mistake. In the
 exceptional case where we do come upon an inaccuracy, the circum-
 stances suggest that it was because of the sloppiness of the copyist
 rather than an error in computation. One business letter does state: "I
 was in a hurry and made a mistake in the addition." Similarly, a docu-
 ment about public revenue and expenditure corrects an error defacing
 an account rendered for the preceding year. 83
An account book was a file into which a merchant entered, in addi-
 tion to notes about his own payments and receipts, a copy of any
 account submitted to a business correspondent. This copy was called
 a~l, "root," "original," because it was admitted in court as circum-
 stantial evidence, if not as formal proof. There are several references
 to this practice. A member of a partnership declares on his deathbed
 that all the sums pertaining to the partnership had been listed in his
 daftar, in his own hand. When a claim was brought in Jerusalem
 against a representative of merchants in Ramie, he was asked to go
 down to that city and to verify the facts from his account book. In a
 court record from 1099 two parties make peace after old accounts were
 found by which the mutual claims could be settled. Even more telling
 perhaps is the following passage from a court record: "One of the
 witnesses remembers the fact, although it is not recorded in a daftar.'' a.
All in all, though far below the standards reached by the Italians in
 the late Middle Ages, accounting in the Geniza period followed well-
 established practices indicative of a long tradition and was a vital
 instrument in the maintenance of an orderly economy.


 E. COMMODITIES, TRADE ROUTES, AND PRICES
 On goods in general.-The list on pages 153-154, above, of all the
 goods handled by a single merchant gives a good idea of the great
 diversity of the Mediterranean trade in the eleventh century. About
 two hundred items of wholesale business recur in the Geniza documents,







 around forty of which were of major importance. With regard to the
 four groups of silk and silk wares, flax and linen cloth, dyeing and
 varnishing stuffs, and medical and culinary plants, there is enough
 material for a Ph.D. dissertation on each. But the object of this book is
 society rather than economy, human relations and not technology. So,
 while surveying the main commodities of the Mediterranean area, the
 routes they traveled, and the prices they obtained, we have in mind the
 people who traded and those who used them rather than the materials
 themselves.
The Arabic language of the Geniza letters, like the English, possesses
 a number of synonyms for the notion of goods. In one short letter we
 find four different designations for the same object; and there are
 others. 1 The vocabulary is equally rich in the various degrees of qual-
 ity. There are at least twelve grades, "mediocre," as in English mean-
 ing poor rather than average. 2 In many letters, as one would expect,
 the addressee is admonished to buy solely of the very best quality.
 In others he is advised to take along also poorer stuff if it is inexpen-
 sive. Thus, a merchant in Qayrawan instructs his correspondent in
 Egypt that in Sicily only first-class indigo can be sold, while a modest
 quality of lapis lazuli may also find a market. 3 Prices often varied for
 slightly different qualities, packed together in the same bale. We have
 long lists to this effect, and astonishment is expressed that the European
 merchants do not pay the same attention to the nuances in quality. 4
 On the other hand, for the sake of expediting transactions, one would
 sometimes forego such minutiae and sell or buy en bloc. A business
 letter sent from Fez, Morocco, to Almeria, Spain, wisely leaves it to
 the man on the spot to decide which of the two methods to follow. 5
Goods were usually ordered and shipped in round numbers: 100
 pieces of cloth, sent from Qayrawan to Egypt; 400 such pieces and 400
 gowns, going the same way; 25 Sicilian pounds of shelled almonds, also
 shipped to the East; 50 mantles, 10 pairs of stockings, 10 carpets, two
 orders of 20 pairs of shoes, and another two of 20 knives and many
 other commodities ordered in round numbers from Spain; 700 hides, all
 bought for the same price in Sicily. A hundred jugs of wine were esti-
 mated to have a value of 250 dirhems in Egypt, and 50 beehives, or
 rather swarms of bees, cost 20 dinars there. This list could go on in-
 definitely. A newspaper report from January 6, 1967, announces the
 discovery of 40 millstones in a boat buried beneath the sea floor off
 the Palestinian coast. Since a handmill consists of two stones, this
 consignment probably contained the same quantity of "20 millstones,"
 as the one mentioned in the Geniza letter cited on page 60, above, as
 sent from Palestine. 6
Bear in mind that in those days goods did not come from an assem-
 bly line. Although traded in round numbers, they were not delivered
 by the producer in such quantities. A merchant would order 20 pieces
 of clothing, but advise his correspondent to collect them from various
 stores in the bazaar.7 Or, 165 gowns worth 165- 1 1}b dinars would be







shipped to a customer, but they had been picked up in quantities of one
to six pieces, in the course of 29 purchases made in 19 different stores
(as the accounts of these operations, rendered to a partner, tellingly
reveal) .8 In other words, trading in round numbers did not depend on
industrial techniques, but was a device of commercial expediency. We
often find, too, that shipments would contain whatever quantities a
merchant was able to secute with the means at his disposal. In general,
it seems that the closer a business relationship was, the less the prin-
ciple of round numbers prevailed.
 Despite the great variety of goods in wholesale trade which appear
in the Geniza papers, there are sizable areas of commercial activities
which are not represented at all. The main cereals, such as wheat,
barley, and rice, are next to absent, except in purchases for private
consumption or in sales of the products of one's own fields. Thus far,
only one legal document ref erring to a wholesale merchant in grain
has come to light.9 There is nothing about trade in camels, horses,
mules, or donkeys-the cars and trucks of that period-either as
mounts or beasts of burden, and nothing about cattle for either food or
breeding. Only the sale of chicken, so popular with both Jews and
Egyptians, is a frequently mentioned occupation. The slave trade, in
the ninth century still partly in Jewish hands, is not represented in the
"classical" Geniza at all. 10 Similarly, transactions in arms and in tim-
ber, both of which to a large extent came from Europe, are referred to
in the Geniza papers only in connection with purchases for private or
communal needs.
Trade routes and volume of commerce.-Even more pronounced were
the limitations in respect to trade routes. The Rum-Byzantines, Ital-
ians, and others-were customers of first-rate importance for the goods
sold on the markets of Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, and Sicily. As a rule,
though, it was the Europeans who came to these markets, not the
Arabic-speaking traders who transported the goods to Europe. There
are scattered references to business trips to Constantinople, Salerno,
Amalfi, Genoa, Marseilles, and other Christian cities, as well as to "the
 countries of the Rum" in general, but it is clear that such trips were
 neither regular nor made by a great number of merchants. As to exports
 from Europe, it was perhaps natural that timber should have been
carried to Egypt in Venetian, Genoese, and Amalfian boats. Byzantine
 textiles and medical plants, both ref erred to so frequently in the Geniza,
were imported by traders other than the Jews specializing in these
 articles. To all intents and purposes, the Arabic-speaking Jewish mer-
 chants of the Mediterranean area (with the possible exception of those
of Sicily and Spain) were confined to the realm of Islam. They were
 connected with their coreligionists in Europe by bonds of general cul-
 ture, religion, and philanthropy (extended by the former to the Jatter),
 but not by business relations of any significance. The European traders
 with whom the Geniza merchants dealt were exclusively Christian.11
 The trade routes within the Arab world were characterized by the







 overlapping of long- and short-distance itineraries. During the tenth
 and earlier parts of the eleventh centuries, Tunisia and Sicily formed
 the hub of the Mediterranean, selling the goods of the East to the West
 and vice versa. The Tunisian and Sicilian ports therefore appear as the
 terminals of most lines originating in Egypt. At the same time there
 were ships that operated directly between Alexandria and the ports of
 the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Spain, such as Seville, Denia,
 and Almeria. One unfortunately fragmentary Geniza letter refers to a
 seemingly direct line between Alexandria and Bijii.ya (Bougie) in
 present-day Algeria.12
 The Sijilmasa caravan, named for its Moroccan desert port of de-
 parture, which also served as a terminal for the Saharan traffic, passed
 through Qayrawan on its way to Egypt. A few days after it had left
(we read in one letter), another caravan set out for Egypt from the
 capital of Tunisia. Siisa, the northern port of Tunisia, where the famous
 Siisi fabrics were made, and Sfax, the outlet for the olive oil grown in
 the south, normally traded with more distant countries through al-
 Mahdiyya, the port of the capital which, since 1057, served as the
 capital itself. Still, we find ships sailing directly from Egypt to these
 smaller ports and delivering goods which the merchants of the capital
 had to buy there. The city of Tunis, of limited importance in the
 eleventh century, had a direct line to Alexandria and served as a
 terminal for a caravan route issuing in Tripoli, Libya, forwarding the
 goods received to Palermo, Sicily, by boat. Tripoli, itself an important
 maritime city, was more often than not bypassed by the ships going to
 the West, evident over and over in the Geniza. From one letter, how-
 ever, we learn about four boats leaving Alexandria for Tripoli on a
single day. The smaller harbors between Alexandria and Tunisia, such
as Tobruk (of World War II fame), Barnik {the ancient Berenike),
or Syrta, would be touched by the international traffic only when ships
were in trouble or for some other special reason. Barqa, the capital
of eastern Libya (comparable to Benghazi today) held a position in
the middle between Tripoli and the sma1ler harbors.13
The Syro-Palestinian coast, stretching from Suwaydiyya, the harbor
of Antioch, in the north, to Ghaza in the south, is represented in the
Geniza by fourteen ports, of which Ascalon, Acre, Tyre, Tripoli
 ('farabulus), and al-Ladhiqiyya were the most prominent. Here again
we have this overlapping of short- and long-distance lines. In one letter,
sent from Alexandria to Tyre, the writer first asks the addressee to give
certain instructions to a young man who would arrive in an 'mhari, or
Nile boat, in that port and, then proceed northward-or as they said
at that time, "go down"-to 'farabulus. He also reports: "A number of
ships have arrived from al-Ladhiqiyya and likewise from Damascus
which were loaded in al-Ladhiqiyya," a statement that implies of
course that these ships had not touched Tyre on their way to Egypt.
One letter from Alexandria is written on board a ship sailing to al-







Ladhiqiyya on the night before its departure. 14 A letter, anxiously in-
quiring about "Acre ships" that might perhaps bring female prisoners,
supposes the ships had sailed from that port.15 An announcement from
Alexandria that five boats had arrived from Suwaydiyya, carrying
gallnuts, jujube, raisins, walnuts, sumac, and tragacanth gum, and
specifying the prices these "northern" products obtained, also leaves
the impression that these boats had not called at any of the thirteen
Syro-Palestinian and three Egyptian ports (Damietta, Tinnis, Ro-
setta) that lay between that Antioch port and the maritime capital of
Egypt. For otherwise, as usual, a statement to this effect would have
been made.16
 Long- and short-distance traffic lines existing side by side are natural
for our modern techniques of transportation. For the Middle Ages it is
remarkable. :Nautical and other technical considerations are weighed
in the next chapter. What calls for comment here is that the very
organization of commerce was favorable to such duplication. In view
of the clumsy means of locomotion available at that time, one wonders
why the Moroccans did not simply transport their goods to Qayrawii.n
and have them sent on to the East with the caravans of Tunisia. Ob-
viously, the volume of commerce between Mororco and Egypt was, at
least sometimes, sufficient to make the establishment of a direct caravan
line between Sijilmasa and Cairo profitable. There must also have
been enough merchants in Egypt who had dealings with Spain and
Morocco, to the exclusion of Tunisia and Sicily, to justify the estab-
lishment of direct shipping lines between Alexandria and the ports of
Spain. Certainly the great India trader I;Ialfon b. Nethanel was such a
merchant. Over thirty letters in his archive show him active in Spain
and Morocco, but nowhere in his extended correspondence, comprising
about seventy-five items, is there any allusion to his ever having been
in Sicily or Tunisia.17 When a letter from Alexandria, written around
1065, informs its addressee that in a ship arriving from Denia, Spain,
not a single Jewish traveler had arrived and that neither that ship nor
the one coming from Almeria carried any goods for him (with the
addition, "may God not thwart your efforts"), one gets the impression
that such occurrences were exceptional. About one hundred and twenty
years later, Maimonides remarks in a responsum that Jews, even
 learned ones, were regular passengers on the boats commuting between
Seville and Alexandria.18
 Yet, with very few exceptions, the Geniza has preserved no letters
 dispatched direct to Egypt from Spain or Morocco. 19 (I;Ialfon received
 his "western" rorrespondence while he was in these countries and car-
ried it with him to Egypt.) This lack might have had its reasons partly
in specific circumstances (discussed above, p. 21). To a large extent,
however, it might also find its explanation in the technique of com-
merce of that time. Only the bigger merchants would engage in long-
distance trade with all the risks it involved. The rank and file, which







 form the bulk of the Geniza people, traveled from one great emporium
 to the next, and moved on only when they were not able to sell what
 they had or buy what they were after. The Andalusians sold their silk
 or copper and the many other products of their country in Tunisia and
 there bought flax and spices and other goods that had come from Egypt
 and Syria. A recurrent topic in the business correspondence from
 Tunisia was whether to sell the goods imported from Spain locally, or
 to forward them to Egypt, and vice versa. 20 The westerners normally
 did business in Lower Egypt and in Palestine and Syria. When they
 were not successful, they moved farther afield, to Jedda, the port of
 Mecca, or to Upper Egypt and Yemen. 21 Goods that could not be sold
 in the cities of Egypt were taken to the towns of the Rif, or "country-
 side." Supplies remaining from deals in Tyre were shipped to the north-
 ernmost big port on the Syro-Palestinian coast, al-Ladhiqiyya. And
 when there was a poor summer season in Alexandria, everyone packed
 his wares and traveled to the Wcst. 22
Thus far we have considered only the main trade routes. There were
 others but they were used only by a minority of people represented in
 the Geniza papers. There was traffic between Cyprus and the Syro-
 Palestinian coast and Egypt, as well as between Egypt and the three
 main ports on the southern shores of Asia Minor, namely (from East
 to West) : Tarsus, the birthplace of Paul; Seleucia, today Silifke; and
 Antalya, the ancient Attaleia, today Adalia. Two ships from Antalya,
 one with seven Jews on board and one with ten, were captured by
 Muslim pirates at approximately the same time, so that traffic must
 have been rather lively, at least during the period concerned (around
 1028). One letter speaks about a voyage from Egypt to Constantinople
 via Jaffa, Rhodes, and Chios, but the trip, rather than following a
 regular route, might have been occasioned by military operations. A
 letter describing a journey in a ship going from Egypt via Constanti-
 nople and Crete to Amalfi in Italy seems likewise to imply that the
 itinerary was not common. The great Greek port of Salonika is re-
 peatedly referred to, but in a way that betrays there was not much
 trade between it and Egypt, at least so far as the merchants who left us
 their papers in the Geniza are concerned. The sea routes to the cities
 of Italy and southern France were of prime importance, but, to repeat,
 were not frequented by the Jews of the eastern Mediterranean. South-
 ern France became even more conspicuous in the Geniza in the thir-
 teenth century, but then it was French Jews who traveled to the East
rather than Oriental Jews trading with the West. 28
 What was the volume of the business carried on along the trade
routes surveyed? Almost every Geniza letter contains some details
about the quantity and value of goods and there are also some occa-
sional remarks about the general state of commerce and its volume.
But merchants usually concluded partnerships and commendas with a
number of correspondents, with the consequence that a letter or an







account usually reflects only a fraction of the transactions done during
one year. And remarks about business at large usually were made only
when demanded for special reasons. Still, the data provided in the
Geniza are so abundant that a comprehensive inquiry into the subject
should prove to be very instructive. For the time being, we must be
content with illustrative examples.
 Around 1065, at a time .of famine and grave disorders in Egypt, the
total volume of olive oil imported from Tunisia to Alexandria was
estimated by a merchant writing from that city as comprising five
thousand ziqq, or skins. 24 In another letter by the same man, written
eight days later, the same total import is estimated as amounting to
six thousand skins.25 This discrepancy seems to indicate that these
estimates were not entirely without foundation. A caravan of five
hundred camels carrying Oriental spices from Qulzum (today Suez) to
Cairo was regarded as very large. 26 With this may be compared the
arrival of a single Jewish merchant from Almeria, Spain, in Fez,
Morocco, with five camel loads.21 A report from Alexandria during a
winter of the early years of the eleventh century states that a great
number of travelers had been detained in the city because many ships-
five are specified by name-needed repairs. Over five thousand camel
loads of goods were left wintering in Alexandria together with the
stranded merchants. 28 In another letter, written by a merchant to his
son at the end of the business season, he lists the names of the ships
that had arrived from Sicily in that particular year and summarizes:
"altogether ten ships, each carrying about five hundred passengers."
There is no indication that the letter, which was written in the second
half of the eleventh century, intended to state anything exceptional.
The number of ships mentioned is paralleled by the many references
to spring and autumn convoys, which invariably consisted of less than
ten boats, five being the average. "Sicily," mentioned in this report
from Alexandria, most probably included Tunisia, since the Tunisian
boats often called on Palermo or Mazara on their way to Egypt.
Travelers were predominantly merchants. When a considerable number
of pilgrims arrived on a ship in a certain year, the Geniza letters take
cognizance of the fact. Most of the pilgrims also engaged in business
ventures. Thus, this report about five thousand passengers making use
of the most frequented trade route between Sicily and Egypt, during
one year might be representative of the situation as a whole. Notice
the predilection for the round number five displayed by the writers of
the Geniza letters. The habit might mean that the average capacity of a
big ship was actually four hundred passengers, as suggested by other
documents. 29
 As to the volume of business of individual traders, by happy coinci-
dence, we possess reports for two years of alJ the consignments sent
by Ibn 'Awkal (see p. 158, above) from Alexandria to Tunisia and
Sicily. In one year it consisted of 179 standard bales {weighing between







450 and 600 pounds) and 2 smaller bundles, and in the other, 89 bales
shipped to al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, and 57 to Sicily, altogether 146 bales.
The majority of these consignments certainly contained flax. Whatever
their contents, they were worth several thousand dinars, or hundreds
of thousands of dollars in our money. 30 In an account written in Tunisia
in approximately the same period (first half of the eleventh century),
a total of 133 bales of flax worth 2,318 dinars was sold for one merchant
during one season, and in those early years the dinar had a higher value
 than later in the century. Another account from that period shows that
 2,033 dinars were cashed in Qayrawan for consignments of indigo,
 sugar, and silver (vessels or disused coins). A partnership between two
merchants in 160 bales of flax is referred to in a court record of the year
1041-1042. These are examples of quantities sent by the greater mer-
 chants represented in the Geniza. 31
 A stroke of luck provided reports for the entire business conducted
by a merchant from Qayrawan with his uncle and cousin, respectively,
 during two different years. In one year it amounted to 1,628 quarter
 dinars and half a qirat, or 407-¼ 8 dinars, and in another year to 675
 dinars. 32 This tallies with two detailed accounts, one for the senior
 Taherti brothers regarding the year 1024 and the other for one of the
 junior Tahertis in 1048. The first specifies the weight, quality, and price
 of 23 bales of flax, received in Qayrawan from Egypt, against which
 Tunisian textiles worth 2,828 quarter dinars, or 707 dinars, were
 shipped. The second details a great variety of Sicilian and Tunisian
 goods shipped to Egypt of a total value of 281 dinars and 16,889-½
 dirhems. The dinar at that time contained an average of 36 dirhems.
 Thus the second sum equaled 469 dinars, and the total was 750 dinars.
 There is little doubt that this account lists all the goods sent from
 Qayrawan to the Taherti sojourning in Egypt, for his relations with
 the writer of the account are known to us from a number of documents
(partly dated), which show that the latter was his representative and
 "disciple" who took care of all his affairs at home while he was
 abroad ,83 A merchant from Alexandria, who had been connected with a
 business correspondent in Old Cairo for many years, writes to him as
 follows: "I have not asked you for the old accounts, but please, with
 your usual kindness, provide me with the complete account for this
 year, written [or sjgnedJ in your own hand." After having submitted
 this request, the writer specifies the assets and liabilities himself: 310
 dinars were expended by him and about 250 by his correspondent.
 In this case, however, we definitely know that both merchants had
 dealings with others too. 8'
The contracts of partnership, such as those discussed above {pp. 173-
 179), the court records dealing with debts and other obligations re-
 sulting from wholesale transactions, and, above all, the business letters
 themselves show that the value of goods exchanged between average
 overseas traders in one season amounted only to several hundred dinars,







sometimes to over a thousand, but often only to a few hundreds or
even less. Shipments comprising more than a hundred bales during one
year and worth over two thousand dinars are exceptional. This, taken
together with our assumption that about eight thousand merchants
commuted on the Tunisia-Sicily-Egypt maritime trade route in a
normal year, gives some idea of the scope of Mediterranean trade
within the realm of Islam during the eleventh century.
"Medieval commerce at its peak was great only in comparison with
that of earlier periods. When compared with that of the modern world,
it shrinks in size to a trickle." 85
This statement, made by a competent economic historian, is certainly
confirmed by the evidence of the Geniza documents. If, however, it is
compared with the size of the population and the standard of living of
that period, their volume of commerce is impressive both in view of
the achievement of the individual merchant and with regard to the
place of commerce within the medieval economy in general.
The jungle of prices.-The study of prices in the Geniza, let alone in
Arabic literary sources, is like attempting to solve an equation with
four unknowns: the exact nature, type, and quality of the commodity
traded ; the identity of the weights, measures, or other indications of
quantity referred to; the value of the money paid; and, finally, the
time, place, and specific circumstances of the transaction concerned. In
many cases, when prices are indicated, one, or more, or all, of these
elements are not expressly mentioned and may be established only with
the aid of other sources. "The price of silk here is 25." Such remarks
abound. An analysis of the letter in which this remark occurs would
show that it was written in Alexandria in the second half of the eleventh
century. Other documents reveal that silk was regularly traded in
quantities of 10 pounds and that there was a standard price of 2 dinars
per pound. Thus the remark in question would mean that, at the time
that letter was written, 10 pounds of silk in Alexandria cost 25 dinars,
or 25 percent above the standard price. Since there is no indication of
any monetary crisis in that letter, at least the approximate value of the
dinar may be taken for granted. In many cases, however, auxiliary
sources assisting us in the correct assessment of incompletely indicated
 prices remain to be found. 86
An investigation into the economy or even the society of a given
 period cannot be complete without an understanding of the meaning of
the prices occurring in its writings. A study of the Geniza with this
 aim in mind is particularly rewarding, because the same subject often
 is illustrated from many angles: by formal, detailed accounts; by court
 records and contracts; and, in particular, by numerous and often very
significant references in letters from different times and places. A full
and authoritative appreciation of this rich and reliable, but widely
scattered, material will be possible only after the completion of many
preparatory special studies. What follows gives an idea of the nature







 of information to be expected from these sources and the problems
 involved in their perusal.87
The Geniza papers have two different terms for the notion of price,
 si'r, the price of the unit sold, and thaman, the total proceeds of one
 sale. This distinction is extremely useful for our research, especially as
 many papers are damaged and incomplete. Unfortunately, the writers
 of our letters are of ten content with mentioning only the total proceeds
 from transactions made for the addressee, since the latter was familiar
 with the qualities and quantities shipped. Such statements, disappoint-
 ing as they are for the history of prices, are nevertheless valuable as
 indications of the volume of the business conducted by the person con-
 cerned:~8
The market price, as opposed to that actually obtained, is also desig-
 nated by the word si'r (similar to Hebrew and Aramaic, from which
 it is derived). The identity of medieval with ancient N car Eastern
 terminology in this field goes even further. In Arabic) as in Hebrew,
 one would write: "I do not know how it [ a commodity] stands today,
 for the price has not yet come out." The fixing of the official price, for
 which several other terms exist, must sometimes have been a long
 drawn-out affair, for the writer of the passage quoted, who lived in
 Alexandria, already knew the price for this commodity {mercury, usu-
 ally from Spain), as it had been fixed in the warehouse of a Muslim
 judge in Old Cairo. Another merchant, who had already bought flax
 before the promulgation of the official price, urges a friend to send him
 immediately 200 dinars, for "the price will be fixed after the [Easter]
 holidays," and he wanted to buy more before that event. In Spain, too,
 we hear about purchases made before the price was "defined." 99 The
 detention of goods by a customs house until more of the same supply
 arrived [noted above, p. 201] might have had its reason in the endeavor
 to prevent sales before a reasonable price could be fixed. This was a
 principle acknowledged in both Jewish and Muslim law. 40
 Price lists have been preserved from Almeria, Spain (originally sent
 to Morocco), from Palermo and Mazara, Sicily (forwarded to Egypt
 directly or via Tunisia), from the Syro-Palestinian ports, but mainly
from Tunisia and Egypt, the most important ones from Egypt being
 lists prepared for merchants en route to India. Some of these notes
 were intended to be confidential, as was occasionally emphasized, and
 one was written for this reason in mirror script, its decipherment re-
 quiring the use of a mirror. Others give the impression that they were
copied from lists published by an authority, most probably "the master
of the market," who would compile them in consultation with the more
prominent merchants. For many items, two and even three prices are
indicated, the higher usually quoted before (and not, as we would do,
after) the lower price. The lists of market prices were directives, not
official tariffs, for the Geniza letters everywhere assume that one buys
and sells for whatever price one is able to fetch. The differences be-







 tween the official and the actual prices sometimes were negligible; for
example, market prices in quarter dinars for one hundred pounds, in
Qayraw in, for pepper: 120 or 135 (see next paragrap h), sold for 119;
 indigo: 100-300, according to the very different qualities, sold for 270-
277. Sometimes, when specific conditions prevailed, the discrepancy was
considerably larger. When wax, one of the export staples of Tunisia,
was worth in Qayraw an 6-% 4 (dinars for one hundred pounds) the
 writer was able to buy it for 4- 1 %4 , because, as we learn from the same
 letter, no ships were availabl e for its transpor t overseas. By special
 favor, he was permitte d to load his buy on the Sultan's ship sailing to
Egypt.41
 The market prices for transit goods would normaHy be fixed some-
time after the arrival and before the departur e of the main caravans
 and convoys of ships. But they were, of course, susceptible to change.
 There are many assurances that a merchan t would "watch the price"
 and not even open his bales until the very best price was fixed, and
there are many references to actual fluctuations. We have two price
lists from Qayraw an sent at the end of the summer season and sepa-
rated from each other by only five days. In them is revealed that while
goods as different as flax, indigo, musk, and cinnamon did not change
their prices, pepper went down from 135 to 120 {see preceding para-
graph), and brazilwood, that great staple dye of the Middle Ages, fell
from 300 ("and not to be had") to 200, and only cubeb (an Indian
aromatic and tonic) rose from "4 [pounds] for a dinar" to 3-½. 42 A
Tunisian, writing from Old Cairo to his cousin in Alexandria on a
Sunday in July, reports that in the preceding week he had sold fifty
jars of honey, a staple export of his native country, at the market price
of 3-½ dinars, some of them for ½6 dinar less. On Sunday, the price
was 3 dinars and 10 qirat,s, or ½2 dinar less than on Friday. It was
known that large quantitie s of honey were on their way to Old Cairo,
but the seasoned trader remarks that it was by no means sure whether
their arrival would push the price down. He sold his remaining fifty
jars anyway, having the week before already ordered another one
hundred from Alexandria. In a postscript, written on the following
Thursda y, he reports that much of that commodity had indeed arrived
and the price had fallen to 2 dinars and 20 qirat,s, or a drop of one-
sixth the original price during one week, but that the sales were still
profitable.43
 In the same letter, after having described the fluctuations of the
prices of other commodities, the writer resignedly remarks : "Prices
follow no princi,ple," an observation in which he is echoed by another
merchant, writing from the same city, but a century Jater: "The prices
are in the hand of God," which means: they are inscrutable. The latter
saying was common in ancient Arabic literatur e (also in the form:
"God fixes the prices") , where it is ascribed to the Prophet Muhamm ad
and others. A most eminent contemporary American economist to whom







 this dictum was reported thought that it contained the best theory of
prices known to him.«
While fully aware of the capriciousness of markets and prices, the
Geniza merchants often provided explanations for the specific phenom-
 ena that they had to report. "Flax did not sell, because it was the time
 of buying olive oil [namely for export]," we read in a letter referring
to Sfax, the south Tunisian port with olives growing in the hinterland.
"The price of indigo rose during the last two weeks. It was in demand
by both Syrians and Maghrebis. In my opinion, it will rise even more,
for the Maghrebis will buy it, because flax is scarce and expensive,
while indigo sells well in the Maghreb." In other words, the prices of
one commodity are influenced by the lack or availability of capital
caused by developments with regard to other commodities. "Silk,"
writes a man from Qayrawan, "is scarce, but still sells badly," which
means that rarity alone is no guarantee for a good market, a truth al-
ready discussed by the ancient Arabs. We also hear the opposite:
"Sugar sells well because of its scarcity." A cousin of the merchant who
complained about the unprincipled behavior of prices in Old Cairo uses
the same maxim with regard to al-Mahdiyya, but adds an explanation:
"The prices of our city follow no principle, even the rate of exchange
 [between the gold dinar and the silver dirhem] sometimes rises up to
seventeen points and sometimes goes down at the same rate according
to demand and so do the goods, for our place is very weak." In the same
letter he notes: "The prices in general are quiet." Another letter from
the same city enlarges upon this point by explaining that a poor coun-
try such as Tunisia had become at that time, cannot have a stable
economy, since even slight changes in supply and demand throw its
market out of gear. How the uncertainties of seafaring in those days
were influential on the fluctuation of prices is shown in the next chap-
ter (p. 302) ,45
Pepper.-The historian studying the movements of prices and rea-
sons for their fluctuation is confronted with formidable difficulties. The
various commodities were traded in specific weights, measures or recep-
tacles, often differing according to place and period, and in the relevant
communications often not indicated. Thus the standard weight for
pepper (as it appears in our accounts) was a buhar, comprising three
hundred pounds, on the Indian route, while on the Mediterranean it
was one hundred pounds j there was also a IJ,iml, or camel load, which
was approximately identical with the 'idl, or ship's bale, both having a
nominal capacity of five hundred pounds. Even at the very time the
letters now in our hands were written, an uncertainty as to the exact
weight of a standard camel load or ship's bale must have prevailed.
Thus we find in a list of market prices from Old Cairo, submitted
around 1050: "Pepper went up from 80 [dinars] for 480 (pounds] to
its· former price of 85," but in another one, communicated about ten
years later: "Pepper 80 for 505." 46
 Still another letter from Old Cairo, written around 1110 and reporting







an actual purchase, refers to a standard weight in the following pas-
sage: "I bought 2 bales of pepper, one weighing 375 and the other 378,
having 3 pounds overweight; price 83-¼ dinars without cost [ of trans-
port, dues and freight]." This seems to indicate that the standard
weight of a bale of pepper at that time was 375 pounds, which is not
surprising, for the actual weight of individual bales during the eleventh
cent,ury was mostly less and often far less than five hundred pounds. 47
The average market price for a bale or load of pepper in Old Cairo in
the 1050's was, according to the two reports reproduced above, 80
dinars. We find quotations in the same period which were far lower (60
and even 55) and others markedly higher. A merchant in Alexandria
bought a bale, inclusive of the cost of transport, for 145 dinars.
Even if we assume the exorbitant sum of 20 dinars for the extra ex-
penditure, we arrive at a price of 125 dinars for the bale. Another
Alexandrian orders his Cairene correspondent to hand over to a relative
200 dinars for the purchase of a bale of pepper and in another letter
written at the same time sends him 100 to buy himself a camel's load
of pepper, "but nothing else." All these details are taken from the
correspondence of N ahray b. Nissim (cf. above, p. 153) .48
Disregarding the last two items, which must have been written at
 the time of an abnormal boom, we find that the price for one hundred
pounds of pepper was variously noted in Old Cairo during the second
 half of the eleventh century as amounting to 11, 12, 16, 17, and 25
 dinars. Even for a commodity so common and so often referred to as
 pepper, only a provisional estimate is possible in the present state of
 research. Its average price (if such a thing existed) in Old Cairo during
 the period concerned seems indeed to have been around 17 dinars for
 one hundred pounds. 49
To be compared with this are the prices at the receiving end, namely
 in Tunisia and Sicily. At the beginning of the eleventh century a camel
 load of pepper cost 83 dinars in Sicily, that is, approximately the same
 price as in the two cases registered for Old Cairo a few decades later. 50
 In those early years, however, the purchasing power of the dinar was
 higher. For the middle of the eleventh century in Sicily and Tunisia, I
 noted the following prices for pepper; the list wa~ compiled at random
 and is by no means exhaustive.
(1) 15 dinars for one hundred pounds of pepper ("lame" [i.e., hard
 to sell]; 51 (2) 22-½ ("the official price, but no one sells for it"); (3)
 23-¾; (4) 25, datable at 1063 approximately; (5) 26-¼; (6) 28; (7)
 29-3/4, 30, 33-¾ (see above, p. 219}; (8) 32-½, 33 ("bad"), 35, 35-½;
(9) 33 ("because in request by Europeans"); (10} 35-¼ (around
 1064); (11) 36, 38 (the latter "sold to Europeans");-- (12, 13} 37-½,
 both referring to Sicily; (14) 45; (15) 62 (written at the end of the
 eleventh or the beginning of the twelfth century).112
None of the letters containing these prices is dated, but, with the
 exception of 1, 5, 12, and 15, most of them can be ascribed with a high







 degree of probability to the 1050's and 1060's. The average price ob-
 tained would be around 34 dinars, or twice the price of pepper in Old
 Cairo at the same time. The costs of packing, customs dues, and trans-
 port have to be deducted from this, which, although varying greatly
 according to the availability of cargo room and the security of com-
 munications, would rarely be more than 20 percent. In view of the
 great risks and losses regularly incurred, an average profit of 80 percent
 seems reasonable.
Our analysis of the prices of pepper, if correct, reveals a fluctuation
 that is not excessive and a difference in price between the countries of
 export and import which corresponds to what one would expect under
 the circumstances. We should not generalize and assume that the same
 was true of other staples. All must be scrutinized separately, even
 though they do noL lend themselves to such an analysis as conveniently
 as pepper and a few other Oriental staples, such as lacquer and brazil-
 wood. There were different varieties and qualities of pepper and we
 hear much about them in the India trade. In the Mediterranean ac-
 counts, however, pepper appears as a uniform standard commodity.
 Thus, at least the first of the four elements necessary for the evalua-
 tion of prices (cf. above, p. 217), namely the nature of the commodity,
 may be taken for granted.
Silk.-The staple goods produced around the Mediterranean, such as
 silk, flax, indigo, corals, and many others, were not so standardized.
 Silk is referred to in the Geniza papers in twelve varieties, differing
according to qualUy and the ways and degrees of processing (specified
 in n. 53). Moreover, the fabrics were distinguished according to the
countries of origin, which ranged from Spain to Sicily, the mai!} pro-
ducers in the West, to Syria, Iraq, and the farthest provinces of Iran
in the East, and even to India and China. 53 This bewildering variety
was mitigated by the the production of a standard silk worth 2 dinars
per pound, or rather 20 dinars per ten pounds. We find this price from
the thirties of the eleventh century to the fifties of the twelfth and
beyond. 54 This standard silk must have had a stabilizing influence on
the economy comparable in a measure to that of the gold dinar itself.
In the India trade it sometimes replaces the cash usually sent from the
West. The standard unit of ten pounds seems to have been regarded as
sufficient, if put to work, for guaranteeing a modest livelihood for a
family. A merchant stranded through shipwreck in Sicily sends this
quantity to his wife in Egypt, and another receives it from the estate of
his orphaned nephews in order to maintain them by trading with it.55
But despite the existence of such standard silk, the variety of silks on
the market was so great that an inquiry into their prices is extremely
hazardous. With regard to flax or indigo the difficulties are even more
pronounced.
 Research into the silk trade becomes particularly complicated be-
cause of its specific role in the finance of the Fatimid period. It fulfilled







a function similar to that of stocks and bonds in our own society. In
other words, it represented a healthy range of speculation, while pro-
viding at the same time a high degree of security. When I read for the
first time about such diverse shipments as oil, wax, and silk, or sales, in
a little town, of cheese, oil, wine, and silk, I was puzzled. Later on, I
realized that everyone, in addition to his substantial business, dabbled
in silk. It was a matter of capital investment rather than of commerce.
Needless to say, the Geniza contains many records of merchants who
traded that commodity as their main line and in quantities of over a
hundred pounds. 56 Nevertheless, the enormous popularity of dealings
in silk and the subsequent profusion of references to them hamper the
efforts to bring the entire material under control.
 Yet the following notations on the market of Alexandria, which seems
to have been the international exchange for this commodity, as well
as those made in some other places, may be taken as fairly representa-
tive. The list contains the prices for 10 pounds (if not noted otherwise) 1
and with the exception of the last three items, in ascending order. (1)
21, 22, or 23 dinars (around 1100); (2) 23, 24, 25 (not yet datable);
 (3) 22, 30 (1100); (4) 25 (1060); (5) 2-% (per pound, same time ap-
proximately); (6) 28-¼ (1100); (7) 2-¾ (per pound, in Old Cairo,
around 1040) ; (8, 9) first-class Spanish silk was sold in Tinnis, the
 port on the eastern arm of the Nile, frequented by merchants from Asia,
 for up to 30 dinars per 10 pounds, and, once, even for 33 dinars (around
 1075); (10) 35 (reported as exceptionally high, with regret that the
 silk was not sold at that time [ around 1145]); (11, 12) in an account
 dated 1046, 11-½ pounds brought in Alexandria only 16-¾ dinars, or
 slightly over 1-½ dinars per pound, and 19 pounds of "peeled" silk
 were sold for less than 24 dinars; (13) in a court record from Old Cairo,
 dated 1098, 15 pounds of silk are valued at 15 dinars. Still, taken
 together with the details provided in note 54, the prices seem reasonably
 steady throughout a century (1050-1150), with a tendency to reach
 25 or 50 percent over the standard price of 2 dinars per pound. 57
We are in a less fortunate position with regard to the prices in
 Sicily and Tunisia, the countries of origin and export, respectively. At
 the beginning of the eleventh century a Maghrebi pound of silk, which
 had approximately the same weight as the Egyptian, cost 1-½ dinars,
 but at that time, as we remember, gold had a somewhat higher value
 than later in the century. 58 In August, 10481 a pound of silk cost in
 Tunisia again 1-½ dinars, but, as we have seen, two years before it was
 sold for almost the same price in Alexandria. According to the same
 account, Sicilian silk was worth, in Tunisia in 1047, 94 dirhems per
 pound, or about 2-½ dinars. 59 The same price for Sicilian silk is noted
 in Sicily itself about two decades earlier, and somewhat later we find
 even there the unusually high notation of about 3 dinars per pound. 80
 So, for the time being, a detailed comparison of the prices of silk in
 countries of export and import is not possible. In general, it appears







 that the margin of profit in this commodity was smaller than the one
 we assumed for pepper, a difference that might be explained by the
 usually smaller quantities and far smaller weights involved, as well as
 by the larger number of persons engaged in the silk trade.
 Flax.-In volume of business, and consequently in the richness of
 information provided by the Geniza, no commodity can be compared
 with Egyptian flax. Tunisia and Sicily were the Liverpool and Man-
 chester of the eleventh century with Egypt providing the main raw
 material," flax. Silk was traded in pounds and ounces, flax in hundred-
 pounds and in bales containing 350 through 600 pounds. The very
 quantities handled required that only professional merchants special-
 izing in this branch approached it. As a corollary, we possess detailed
 businesslike accounts for commerce in flax to an extent not available
 for any other commodity. These accounts are full of technical details
 the like of which are not to be found anywhere else. Thus far, twenty-
 two different varieties, mostly bearing the name of the localities where
 they were grown, have been identified (discussed inn. 61). The varieties
 were frequently subdivided according to quality, sometimes designated
 by fanciful epithets, such as "Fayyiimi" [i.e., grown in the province
 of Fayyiim], specified as ''a stroke with a knife," meaning perhaps "a
 hit," since something exceptionally good was ordered.61
 There were three price groups according to place: the centers of
 the flax-producing agricultural districts of Egypt; the Qalii~ exchange
 and other markets of Old Cairo and Alexandria; and the countries
 of import, Tunisia and Sicily. Actually there was a fourth, or rather
 first, stage: the villages where the flax was grown. We indeed see the
 merchants going to the villages, not so much to buy cheaper, but, as
 is repeatedly stated, to supervise in person the scutching and hatcheling
 of the flax, processes on which the quality of the fiber destined for ex-
 port depended so much. We rarely read about purchases directly from
 the farmers. In one letter a young merchant is strongly advised not to
 make his purchases in the villages, but to reside in Bii~ir, where the
 same could be done more conveniently.62
 It is not surprising that the countries of import should provide us
 with most of our information regarding both market prices and actual
 sales. The letter from which the following passages are quoted contains
 details about both and, like many a letter from Tunisia or Sicily, has
 much additional intelligence about the trade of flax as well. It was
 written around 1040.
 "Flax. Misari: 4.0-28. Tfibi: 45-33. Mala.I: 28-20-18. Fayyumi:
 28-20-18. First-class Fayyiimi sells well and the Misari is the bread
[i.e., the most lucrative article] of our place." 63
 The prices are in quarter dinars per one hundred pounds. Thus, the
 highest quotation was 45 quarters, or 11-¼ dinars, and the lowest 18
 quarters, or 4-½ dinars. This wide gap demonstrates how precarious
 generalizing about prices of flax might be. The list of market quotations
 is found, as usual, near the end of the long letter (although the writer,







 an uncle writing to his nephew, adds much good advice and sundry
 news), the account is close to the beginning, as was also customary.

 In other accounts items of flax sold separately also appear. These
were quantities too badly damaged by seawater to attain any regular
price and therefore were disposed of in bulk. The price of three bales
was about 8-½ dinars per hundred pounds, or similar to the average of
the various market prices noted above. The nominal weight of a bale at
the time of this letter obviously was five hundred pounds, as usual."
One more account from Tunisia, delivered a few decades earlier;
the prices are given here in silver dirhems, not in quarters of gold
dinars. Most fortunately, the exchange rate of gold and silver coins
in force at the writing of the letter is expressly stated. One dinar then
was worth 40-½ dirhem.s.
Account of the six remaining bales [after most of the shipments had
been stained by sea water] :

 Thus the standard bale at that early time (beginning of the eleventh
 or end of the tenth century) contained six hundred pounds and the
 average price for one hundred pounds was 4-½ dinars.66
 The account quoted was submitted to the prominent Cairene mer-
 chant Ibn 'Awkal. Fortunately, four other reports on the sales of his
 shipments of flax to Tunisia and Sicily have been traced. In one, which
 is particularly extensive, can be read details about 37 bales, obtaining
 seventeen different prices. (The document is partly stained with mud.)
 The prices range from 112 to 190 dirhems per one hundred pounds, and,
 since in sixteen cases the totals are converted into quarter dinars, an
 exchange rate of 1 dinar being worth approximately 39-1/2 dirhems could
 be established. The only variety called by name is Fayyumi, ranging
 on the low side (as above, p. 224), with 110, 120, and 130 (three times)
 dirhems. The average price was about 3.9 dinars for one hundred pounds
 of flax. 67 The three other accounts or reports on market prices sent to
 Ibn 'Awkal contain far higher quotations and may be of a considerably
 later period. Two of them are on paper. To be sure, the one reporting
 the highest prices mentioned in Ibn 'Awkal's correspondence is on vel-
 lum. It runs as follows:
 "Flax. Biif;iiri: 9-½-7 dinars per qintar (one hundred pounds).
 Ashmiini: 6-½-4-¾. Good, old Malal: 280-270 (dirhems) .68 Other
 (Malal): 220--160." It is interesting to note, that in the same city
(Qayrawan) and in the same business season, some varieties of flax
 were quoted in gold and others in silver. If we assume again an average
 exchange rate of 1 :40, the prices for Mala.I would be 7-6-¾ dinars for
one quality and 5-½-4 dinars for another, which corresponds to the
quotations mentioned above {p. 224). ln another account for Ibn
'Awkal from the same city, Bu~iri was 8---6 and Mala.I 6-5, but both
were described as selling badly or not selling at all. A letter to him from
Alexandria reporting prices in Palermo, Sicily, simply states: "Flax
in Sicily [the Arabic name for Palermo ]-25 quarter dinars per qintar,"
or 6-% dinars. The letter apparently refers to the late 1020's. 69
 The most complete account of sales of flax in the Maghreb comes
from the year 102410 and is very much at variance with all we have read
thus far. It contains details for 23 bales, ranging in weight from 339 to
359 pounds, the majority weighing around 350, which must have been
the standard at that time. With one exception, the bales were divided
into two bundles, the majority of which differed from one another in
price by ¾ to 2-½ percent. This method of keeping even slightly dif-
 fering qualities apart is expressly recommended in letters. 71 The prices
 range from 34 to 46 quarter dinars for one hundred pounds, with 44
 and above, that is, 11 dinars per qintar, forming the majority. 12
 From 1040 on, the number of letters preserved, and with them refer-
 ences to flax sold in Tunisia or Sicily, become abundant. During the
 middle and later parts of the eleventh century, 4-½ dinars per qintar
 appears to have been the lower limit of the poor varieties and 17-½







the maximum for the best, with 7-11 the average. 73 These great fluctua-
tions are characteristic of a country's single industrial crop, the quan-
tity and quality of which were liable to change every year. "The flax
is mediocre or even poor and little in quantity," writes a man from
Bii~ir, and at the same time announces an unusually high shipment of
17 bales from that small town to Old Cairo. 74
 Quotations from the flax-growing centers in rural Egypt or on the
exchange of Old Cairo or Alexandria are not as plentiful as those from
the countries of import. Another difficulty is that there are many quota-
tions in bales, not in pounds, and we have already seen that the size of
bales was not constant. In a letter from Bu~ir addressed to Ibn 'Awkal,
a camel's load of flax (presumably then weighing six hundred pounds
[see above]) is estimated as being worth 25 dinars, or 4-¼ dinars per
qin~r. 75 A few decades later, the market price there fluctuated between
lS-19 dinars for one quality and 16 and a price not preserved for a lower
grade. The standard bale at that time comprised five hundred pounds,
so that a qint;ar would have had a value of 3.2..,3.8 dinars. 76 A detailed
account from the same town and approximately the same time shows
that at the time of Jading, 14 bales (for shipment on the Nile to Old
Cairo) cost 216-½ dinars, that is, about 15-½ dinars per bale, or some-
where around 3 dinars per qintar. 77 This is seemingly in perfect accord
with the price of 15-% 4 dinars for one bale "including all expenses
laded on the ship of Mujahid," found in an account from the year 1046.
The ship of Mujahid is known to us from at least five other Geniza
documents as commuting between Spain, Tunisia, Sicily, and Alex-
andria, and not between Bu,ir and Old Cairo. Thus a Mediterranean
port must be meant here, the transport to which entailed many ad-
ditional expenses. But bales on such seagoing ships were often smaller
than those on Nile boats because of the ever present danger of jet-
tisoning on the former. 78 Finally, by the end of the eleventh century, a
hundred pounds of flax were sold in Bu,ir for 2-½ dinars, while the
writer of the letter wanted to pay only 11 dinars for a bale, instead of
the 12-½ for five hundred pounds he paid.19
 The prices in Old Cairo were somewhere between those obtained at
Bii~ir and those at the countries of import. Two bales of Bii,iri flax "all
expenses included" in the Egyptian capital cost 45 dinars in 1057, or
4-½ dinars per qintar, and slightly more if the bales, as in the next
case, were somewhat under the standard weight of five hundred pounds.
The same account notes a price of 6 dinars and 1 dirhem for a Laythi
qintar of flax, which is almost the same price because the Laythi
pound was heavier by approximately one-third than the regular pound
referred to here.80 In the following year, 3 bales of Asyuti, each weighing
450 pounds, were bought on the Qiil~ bourse of Old Cairo for 7 dinars
per qintiir, while a Laythi qintar of another unspecified variety cost 6.81
 Our survey of the prices of flax during the eleventh century shows
quotations of 2-½ to 4-¼ dinars per one hundred pounds in Bu,ir, one







 of the centers of flax growing, of 4-½ to 7 on the bourse of Old Cairo,
 and of 4 to 11-½ dinars in Tunisia and Sicily up to 1040, approximately,
 and of 4-½ to 17-½ later. Because of the great differences between the
 varieties traded and the contrasts between good and bad years, these
 quotations have illustrative rather than statistical value. All in all,
 the fluctuations of the market seem to have been far more accentuated
 in flax than in the silk trade, while the margin of profit was nearer
 to that recognizable in pepper.
Sal ammoniac.-Before departing from this elusive subject of prices,
 here is one example of a minor staple, a commodity that appears reg-
 ularly in accounts and business correspondence but whose volume is
 restricted by its very nature. We choose sal ammoniac, a chemical very
 much used in medieval metallurgy for the process of tinning and solder-
 ing. It was found in Central Asia, and we possess Arabic, Persian, and
 Chinese reports about its mining, or rather its gathering. According to
 one Arabic geographer, it was found also in Sicily, but in all Geniza
 papers it appears as an article of export from Egypt to Sicily and
 Tunisia.82 Its name nushiidir (often spelled with <J), which is Persian
 also betrays its origin in an area outside the Arabic-speaking world.
 The rather frequent family name Nushadiri, trader in sal ammoniac,
 is derived from it. Sal ammoniac was sold in units of mann, or two
 pounds, the standard price being 1 dinar for 2 mann. In the following,
 an attempt is made to arrange chronologically a number of quotations
 for this commodity.
1. Tunisia (1000); winter; 1 dinar for 2-¾-3 mann (sold). No de-
 mand.
 2. Qayrawan ( 1020) ; late winter; 1 dinar for 2-½ mann.
 3. Sicily (1030); early winter; 1 dinar for 2 mann.
 4. Al-Mahdiyya (1035 or earlier); midsummer. "I sold 72 mann
 for the price of 18 or 18-½ dirhems; total, with the deduction of the
 discount granted, 1,391. There remained 34 mann with which I debited
 myself at the highest price obtained, total 629; and waste, weighing
 6-½ pounds, worth 7 per pound, total 45; grand total 2,065." The ex-
 change rate of the silver dirhems was at that time approximately 1 :36.
 Thus, the price of sal ammoniac was again 1 dinar for 2 mann.
 5. Old Cairo (1050); summer; 100 pounds cost 27 dinars, again 1
 dinar for 2 mann. The writer of this letter is the addressee of number
 4, but according to the other persons mentioned in both letters, number
 5 is from a far later period.
 6. Qayrawan (August 9, 1052); 11 One mann costs 1-1/s dinars,"
 This and other prices were low because too much mercha.n<lise, both
 "eastern" and "western," was available in the city.
 7. "In Qayrawii.n (1055), they sold sal ammoniac for 3 quarter
 dinars, which is an excellent price," letter from Alexandria in mid-
 summer; this would mean 1 dinar for 1-½ mann.
 8. Mazara, Sicily (1060) ; fall; "Sal Ammoniac: [Miisi] ·b. Abi







'l-l)ayy sold 3 [pounds] less 1 or 2 ounces (for 1 dinar], or 1 dinar for
1-¾_ 2 or 1-½ mann."
 9. Al-Mahdiyya (in or around 1063) ; end of summer; "1 dinar for
2 mann. At present somewhat less."
 10. Al-Mahdiyya (1070); winter; l dinar for 2 mann.
 11. AI-Mahdiyya (1075); fall; ½ dinar for 2 mann. In general the
prices were "quiet" and lower than in case number 10 by 30 percent
and more.
 12. Alexandria (1140); I dinar for 1-½ pounds (¾ mann). "Prices
like fire," or high, because many buyers arrived unexpectedly. 83
 With the exception of the last two items, which refer to unusual
situations expressly mentioned in the relevant letters, the price of sal
ammoniac evinces an impressive stability. In five out of the remaining
nine cases, the market prices obtained were identical with the standard
price of 1 dinar for 2 manns irrespective of the period, the season of
the year and even the locality (exporting Cairo or importing Sicily or
Tunisia). The prices in numbers 1 and 2 arc what we would have ex-
pected in view of the higher purchasing power of the dinar at the be-
ginning of the eleventh century, while numbers 6 and 7 indicate boom
years with identical good prices. Assuming that in those years sal
ammoniac was traded in Old Cairo at the standard price, the profit
from the sales in Tunisia and Sicily would have been 33-½ percent.
 The very form of the quotations deserves attention. They do not say:
1 mann of sal ammoniac costs so-and-so much money, but, rather: for
1 dinar, this-or-that quantity of the commodity concerned can be had.
This way of quoting a price was common, in particular with regard to
the main foodstuffs, such as wheat and oil, and has remained so well
into the twentieth century. Another most noticeable feature was the
endeavor to fix standard prices in round sums. We had 1 pound of silk
costing 2 dinars, and 2 mann of sal ammoniac worth 1 dinar. Even more
remarkable are the standardizing of the price of the thawb, the gown,
or basic piece of clothing, fixing it at 1 dinar and the standardizing of
one hundred pounds of bread at ½ dinar. This question and that of the
prices of the commodities of daily use in general will be taken up in
our chapter on the cost of living and standards of life. 84



 F. MONEY, BANKING, AND FINANCE
 The nature of money and the business of the banker.-This sub-
 section will come as a disappointment to readers inured to the idea that
 banking during the Middle Ages consisted mainly of moneylending
 and that the Jews were the Rothschilds of the Islamic world. These
 concepts were fostered by an often-quoted article by Louis Massignon,
 the late dean of the French Arabists, which was based on a few data







 about Jewish merchants of the ninth century granting loans to various
 government agencies in Baghdad. This article overrates the economic
 importance of the Jewish minority and gives an uneven impression of
the banking business. In history books destined for the general reader,
we also find exaggerated statements about the use of "checks" and bills
of exchange in the Arab world of the Middle Ages. A more detailed
perusal of the literary sources would have qualified such notions con-
siderably. The evidence of the Geniza papers provides an altogether
different picture. 1
 There seems to be a close connection between the banking practices
reflected in the Geniza documents of the eleventh century and those
known to us from Europe two or three hundred years later. This obser-
vation in no way implies that the latter were derived from or influenced
by the former. Such conclusions lie outside the scope of this book. There
is, however, little doubt that the Geniza is an important source for
the early history of medieval banking. In view of this, relevant material
from its documents is presented here in sor.ie detail.
 The vital role played by the banker was a function of the monetiza-
tion of the economy. But strange as it may appear, that highly mone-
tized society of the Geniza period had no proper word for the abstract
concept of money. The term 'ayn, "substance," sometimes has this
meaning, especially in the phrase 'ayn wa-'arif,, cash and kind, which is
common in wills and designed to comprise all a testator left. 2 'Ayn,
however, generally denotes gold coin, as opposed to waraq, silver coin,
for example, in the statement: "Received 10 dinars, 7 in 'ayn, 3 in
waraq,1' and in many similar statements. 3 Thus, the occasional use of
'ayn in the sense of money only underlines the fact that the language
had no specific word for that notion. The denominations of the gold
and silver coins, dinar and dirhem, also sometimes stand for money.
Other substitutional expressions are found in Appendix A.
 This terminological deficiency reflects economic realities. Gold and
silver coins were means of payment, but were also traded like goods:
"I bought gold [dinars] in the House of Exchange." "I sent silver
coins to so-and-so and he will take care of their sale." This is the way
in which money was ref erred to in eleventh-century letters! In prin-
ciple, at each transaction, coins, like goods, had to be weighed and
their value, that is, fineness and state of preservation, had to be de-
termined. The idea of payment was expressed in Arabic, as it had been
before in Akkadian, Hebrew, and Aramaic, by the verb "weighing,"
although a different Semitic root was used. Some deeds of sale state,
indeed, that the type and weight of the coins serving as payment have
been tested and found to be correct, while in a number of other docu-
ments the receiving party expressly releases the payer from that exami-
nation.11 As might be expected, the records make mention of the pro-
cedure of payment only if, for one reason or another, it was not made
entirely according to the law. Here is the witness of a banker: "Man~iir







 came, accompanied by two Muslims who demanded from him the price
 of a quantity of flax. He produced dinars and handed them over to me
 in order to weigh them in the presence of the two parties. I weighed
 and examined them arid found among them fifteen 'Adliyya dinars"
(special deluxe issues that were not supposed to be circulated) .8 Here,
 then, was the first and foremost role of the banker: he served as a
 clearinghouse for the making of payments.
Weighing and assaying were tedious and time-consuming procedures.
Therefore, money was handled largely in sealed purses of coins the exact
 values of which were indicated on the outside. As is well known, a simi-
lar system prevailed also in the Roman and talmudic societies and,
 subsequently, in Christian Europe. 7 Two types of purses are discernible
in the Geniza records, those that bore the seal of certified money-
 assayers, of a government office, or of a semiofficial exchange, and others
referred to by the names of individual merchants. The following quota-
tions are illustrative of the first type: "A purse of 50 dinars with the
seal of the well-known banker in the Street of the Alchemists" (1086;
the name of the banker is known from another document). "A purse
 from the Treasury-76-¼ dinars; another from the same-53 and 1
qiriW' (1059). "A bag from the Government house" (probably also
meaning the Treasury; the deed is in Hebrew [998]). "Purses of [the
 House ofJ Blessing," containing 7, 9, 20, and 50 dinars, respectively,
were issued by the Fustat exchange bearing that name.8 The numerous
items in bankers' accounts of purses of individual merchants might
refer to two different cases. In accounts for business friends we re-
peatedly find listed on the credit side: "A purse containing such and
such an amount of dinars bearing your seal," alongside with other
purses unsealed, which seems to mean that the former was accepted
without further examination. Naturally, a banker would act thus only
for an accredited customer, mu'amil, and we have to remember that
many merchants were "merchant-bankers," who were themselves ex-
perienced in the handling of money. Such "private" purses could have
had another origin. When a deal was made and the time fixed for pay-
ment had arrived, the purchaser went to a banker and had him weigh,
test, and seal in a purse the amount of coins to be paid. On the purse
he most probably added his own seal to that of the banker, and it was
then called by his name. This procedure is alluded to in a passage re-
f erring to a seller who for certain reasons was slow in delivery of the
goods. "I went. to him with the dinars, sealed in a purse."•
As a rule, bankers' accounts indicated solely the real value of the
dinars, namely their weight. Thus, the treasury purse of 76-¼ dinars
mentioned above most probably contained 80 gold pieces. Letters re-
ferring to purses sent overseas or from one city to another usually in-
dicate both the number and the weight of the coins contained in them.
In these consignments the weight, that is, the real value, was intended
to be a round sum, whereas the number usually was not. In a letter from







 Tunisia providing details about purses sent by one merchant in six
 different ships, the distribution was as follows:
 Number of gold pieces Their weight
308-¾300
153-½150 less½
300-½ and¾ 300
255-½250 less¼
122119-%
154-¼150 and two qirii.!s (1/12)
This list also shows that the various shipments varied considerably
 with regard to the value of the dinars sent. Those in the third purse
 (300-¾-300) are of full weight to a degree remarkable even for newly
 minted coins. The others are less so. In the first purse 308-¼ dinars were
 needed for the weight of 300, and in another letter, also going from
 Qayrawan to Egypt, 309-¾ were needed.1°
The merchants tried hard to send dinars of full weight. A purse of
 100 less ¼ 'Aziziyya, that is, dinars of the caliph al-'Aziz (975-996),
 was sent to the great Ibn 'Awkal from Qayrawan around 1020 A.D.,
 and 100-1/s dinars went from Alexandria to the office of Nahray b.
 Nissim in Old Cairo, there to await the arrival of the sender.11 We find
 that for the most part, however, people were not successful in this
 endeavor. In the year 1050-1051 a purse weighing 49- 2 %4 (intended:
 50) dinars, but actually containing 53-½ pieces, was on its way from
 Tunisia to Egypt. And yet, at approximately the same time, a purse
 with 50 coins carried from Old Cairo to the flax-growing center of
 Bii~ir had the value of only 44- '1/s dinars. The Qayrawanese notable,
 Moses Ibn al-Majjani, sent to Ibn 'Awkal a purse of "120 dinars in
 number, among them five in quarters, that weighed 117- 2 %4 ." 12 Some-
 times, as in some of the examples previously provided, both the weight
 and the number were fractional, for example, of a purse going from
 Tripoli, Libya, to Fustat, with 116-¼ pieces weighing 109-½ dinars,
 where possibly 110 were intended.18
Close business friends occasionally left the testing to the receiver
 and indicated in their communication solely the number of coins re-
 mitted, for example, 50 in a letter to Nahray b. Nissim (who was him-
 self a banker), or r,1,500 quarter dinars from the mint of Sicily [i.e.,
 Palermo]," sent from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia.1• In such a case the re-
 cipient might experience difficulties when he happened to be in a small
 town, as we read in a letter from Bii~ir: "I received the two purses and
 verified the number of the coins, but not their weight, for I have no
 scales." 111
The round sums of gold pieces most frequently contained in purses
 sent out of town were 50 and 100, but 200 (or 800 quarter dinars), 250,
 and 300 were not uncommon either. When an ingot of gold bullion,
 tibr, worth 90 dinars, together with a purse of 100 dinars was sent from







 Sicily to a merchant in Egypt, the sender clearly considered investing
 a sum of about 200 dinars. 16 The purses traded locally were of a far
 smaller size. Twenty dinars was a particularly favored amount, but we
 also find round sums of 10, 15, 25, and 30, as well as purses containing
 only a few coins, such as 4 and even "2 dinars and 10 qirats" (in
 weight, presumably 2-½ in coins) .17
Silver coins were not traded in sealed purses locally, judging from
 the preserved banker accounts. While going overseas, namely from the
 Muslim West to Egypt, silver was sent in purses of one or of several
 thousand dirhems, but nowhere were the number and the weight of the
 coins distinguished, as was done with gold. At the most, we would find
 a remark like the following: "I sent a purse of 1,000 excellent dirhems
 for you personally and another 1,000 for my lords, the Tahertis." 18 In
 a single letter are mentioned shipments of three purses containing a
 total of 10,500 dirhems, two purses of 6,000 less 70, two of 2,000, in
 addition to one of 2,000, and others, details about which have not been
 preserved completely. 19 A consignment of a merchant-banker in Alexan-
 dria to another in Old Cairo contained among many items in gold two
 purses of 2,000 dirhems each, classified according to a slight difference
 in the exchange rate at which they were expected to be sold in the
 capital.20
The absence of purses of silver coin from the bankers' accounts of
 the Fatimid period is to be explained by the fact that no dirhems were
 minted in Egypt during most of that time. To be sure, huge quantities
 of this specie were imported to Egypt from the Muslim West year after
 year, and some came from Arab Asia too. The Geniza, whose informa-
 tion is generally scanty on the relations between Egypt and that part
 of the Muslim world, does not provide us here with many details. In
 989, a merchant from Nisibis in Mesopotamia carried with him to
 Damietta 1,320 silver pieces from the estate of a man who had died in
 the former town. In 1036, a power of attorney is given in Fustat for
 the collection of 1,750 dirhems in Tyre, Lebanon. More significant is
 an inquiry made around 1050 by an Egyptian merchant traveling in
 Syria regarding the "price" in Old Cairo of the Nizariyya silver coins,
 minted in Damascus, of which he was carrying a certain amount. Thus
 we see that around the middle of the eleventh century these dirhems,
 coined in Syria before 996 (the year in which Niziir, that is, 'Aziz,
 died), were still in demand in Egypt. During most of the Fatimid
 period, however, sizable transactions usually were made in gold and
 largely with the aid of bankers, while silver money primarily served
 for current expenses such as retail purchases and the payment of rent
 for modest habitations. Accounts of a cheese merchant from July, 1150,
 note outstanding payments for pounds in silver, but for hundredweights
 in gold. 21
Needless to say, dirhems, too, were kept in bags. In an account from
 April, 1183, an administrator of buildings belonging to the congregation







 of the Palestinians in Old Cairo handed over to the communal cashier
 two purses of 100 dirhems each, a third purse of 166, and a fourth of 42.
 These amounts represented the rents collected by him during the pre-
 vious two months. He had put part of the money in round sums into
 bags, and left other amounts as he had collected them.22 In later
 Ayyubid times, when gold had become scarce, we see a bank granting
 loans of four and five hundred dirhems, respectively, alongside sums
 of dinars. Whether these amounts of silver money were traded in sealed
 purses is not said.23
 The banker's second field of activities, which provided also the
general term for his profession, money changing {cf. 11ayrafi, changer),
was not unconnected with the one considered thus far, namely the
 weighing and testing of coins and the issue of purses of certified con-
tents and value. A great variety of coinages was on the market at a
time and required expert handling. It would be a mistake, however, to
assume that the idea of legal tender was foreign to the Mediterrean
society of the High Middle Ages. The local issue was regarded as the
normal means of payment. When a Spanish handbook of market super-
vision instructs the superintendent not to admit any currency other
than the local coinage, we might suspect that at the time and place
the book was written it was necessary to enforce such an instruction,
because in practice it was honored by breach rather than by observ-
ance.24 But as far as Egypt of the Fatimid times is concerned, the
testimony of the Geniza records proves that the idea of a legal tender,
naqd, was a reality. When a payment is made or stipulated in a con-
tract, the money-gold, of course-is described usually as Mil!ri, which
means "minted in Fustat," and in more formal documents the dinars
were defined as "of Fustat coinage and Fustat standard weight" or as
"Fustat currency at this time." In a will made in Alexandria in 1201,
a merchant leaves to each of his nieces (how many he had is not
said) 10 Mu'mini dinars, that is, dinars of the Almohad caliph 'Abd
al-Mu'min (d. 1163). But the same wi1l comprised over two thousand
dinars in Egyptian currency.25
 The notion of "legal tender," jawiiz, is attested to in the Geniza
for Spain, Sicily, Tunisia, and, naturally, Egypt, albeit the word seems
not to be registered in this sense in the Arabic dictionaries. Around
1070, two purses of 100 dinars each, "legal tender of Fustat," are sent
from Alexandria to the capital of Egypt with detailed orders for
Oriental imports.26 A decade or so earlier another man wrote from the
Mediterranean port to the same destination: "I sent you two purses
containing 205 Nizii.riyya dinars, coined in al-Mahdiyya. Kindly work
on their change into local tender and leave the money obtained until
my arrival." 21 From the term jawaz a verb jawwaz, "to convert into
tender," was formed which was used both in Spain {by a local merchant)
and in Egypt. In a letter going from Alexandria to Old Cairo dwing
the second half of the eleventh century, 76 Ma'add dinars coined in







 al-Mahdiyya are sent with the remark: "If they can be traded, convert
 them into local currency." Dinars with the name Ma'add, that ie, the
 Fatimid caliph Mustani;ir, were minted in al-Mahdiyya as late as
 1062.28 "Eastern tender" in the language of the merchants of Tunisia,
 Sicily, and probably of Spain, too, was equivalent to the coinage of
 Fustat.29
The economic strength of a country was-as it is today-the pre-
 requisite of a good currency. Easy access to the raw metals was another
 most vital condition. During the first half of the eleventh century, the
 Geniza letters chronicle an incessant flow of gold and silver coins from
 Tunisia to the East as payment for the products of Egypt, Syria, and
 the Orient. Around 1000, the depletion of the West of its silver money
 was so great that we find a merchant writing from Qayrawan asking
 his correspondent to buy for him Qayrawan dirhems in the markets
 of Fustat. When the country was laid waste by the hordes of the Hilii.l
 and Sulaym, which also cut off its supply of gold from the Sudan,
 everything changed. "Sicilian" and "Riim" (Norman and Italian)
 currencies and, above all, the Murabiti dinar take the place of local
 issues. In spring, 1064, a Tunisian merchant sends to Egypt Palermo
 quarter dinars instead of those coined in al-Mahdiyya, for, he writes,
 he did not dare hope that the latter would find a market in the country
 of destination. 30
The idea that the local coinage constituted the legal tender was not
 easily defeated, even when the local government became very much
 weakened, as was the case in Tunisia after the Bedouin invasions of
 the 1050's. In the later decades of the eleventh century a much debased
 dinar was legal tender in al-Mahdiyya, although no coine seem
 to have survived from that troubled period.31 The merchants coming
 from abroad were forced to sell their goods for al-Mahdiyya dinars
 with which they would tben acquire money of international standard,
 in particular Murabiti dinars; which now began to replace the Fatimid
 currency in the Mediterranean trade. The Muriibit (Almoravid)
 empire controlled all routes to the western Sudan where the gold came
 from, and, moreover, possessed vast resources enabling it to maintain
 a steady high standard of its currency. From a letter, written in al-
 Mahdiyya around 1100, we learn that at that time it was still not
 easy to get hold of that precious specie. "I sent you 100 Murabiii
 dinars of full weight, their price being in the currency of al-Mahdiyya
 267 less l/4 dinars. I did not occupy myself with anything else until I
 succeeded in buying them. They are Bakriyya [i.e., issued by the Amir
 Abii Bakr between 1058 and 1087] and A.ghmatiyya [i.e., minted in
 the town of A.ghmat in Morocco beginning in 1088] ." 11 In an account
 submitted approximately at the same time the same Old Cairene
 merchant, his representative in al-Mahdiyya there "bought" both
 Fa.timid and Murabiti dinars for local ones, which he had received
 for the sale of purple cloth, wool, and Oriental spices imported from







 Egypt. The specifications given in that account are instructive by
 themselves:

80 30-22/242-14/24
78-22/24 30-Ys same
 IO-¼Murabitis, number and "price" not indicated.

We see that around 1100 an Egyptian merchant active in Tunisia
 tried to obtain approximately equal amounts; of Egyptian and Murabiti
 currency for his goods. He paid slightly more for Egyptian dinars and
 the rate of exchange with regard to the Murahiti differed in the two
 accounts submitted to him (1: 2.666 and 1 :2.583) .88 Again at the same
 time, or perhaps even a few years earlier, an Alexandrian merchant sent
 13 "stones," or ingots, of silver weighing 2,900 dirhems to the "West"
 with the instruction: "Buy me dinars, Murabitis, .Aghmii.tis or quarters
(presumably Norman], but not one shred of textiles." The money of
 the West was urgently needed in Egypt because it was on its way to
 becoming the international medium of payment, and the Maghrebi
 merchants arriving in Alexandria began to ask to be paid in it for
 their goods.u Some accounts of a banker in Fustat. from the later
 decades of the eleventh century seem to be based on Muriibiti rather
 than on Fatimid dinars. 35
Despite the predominance of the local coinage, money changing was
 one of the most common activities on the medieval markets. The
 reasons are well known. Governments did not always withdraw old
 currencies, for specie was scarce in general. Coins became thinner and
 less valuable through wear so that even the same currency had different
 exchange values at a time. Foreign traders sent or brought coins from
 other places, and local merchants doing business in foreign parts were
 eager to equip themselves with money accepted there. In general,
 currencies were accepted beyond the frontiers of the country of issue,
 but their value was not the same even in different cities of one country.
The Geniza papers include material on money changing, such as
 accounts reporting such transactions, and letters referring to coins
 sent from one place to another, indicating their value in Egyptian
 dinars, or requesting to change them into a specified currency. The coins
 were described either in a general way, such as "quarters," meaning
 quarter dinars coined in the Muslim West, or were defined more elabo-
 rately by the name of the ruler or the dynasty appearing on them, the
 city in which they were minted, some characteristic traits (suoh as
 whether the legend on the coin was arranged in parallel lines or in
 concentric circles) 1 or several of these m~ans of identification together.
 Often the quality was indicated by such terms as excellent, ftne, gen-







 uine, mediocre, or it was stated whether the coins were "fresh" or "old,"
 the latter frequently being regarded as an advantage, namely in cases
 where a previous issue was of a higher value, for example, when a mar-
 riage contract dated 1241 expressly stipulates payment in "good old
 Mi~r dinars." 36 The details of number and weight have been discussed
 above. The following is an example of a fairly complete description:
 ''Rum [i.e., Norman] quarters, arranged in three lines, good ones,
 weighing 100 mithqils of full weight and worth 58 [Egyptian]
 dinars." 81
"Fresh," (ari, meant unimpaired by wear, hence having full weight.
 In a letter from Alexandria, sent around 1120, a Maghrebi merchant
 announces that a friend carried for him a purse with 101 fresh dinars
 weighing 100-¼, and asks the addressee to "sell" them, that is, to
 convert them into local Egyptian money.38 The term "fresh" did not
 imply that the coins were new. It was customary to put freshly minted
 coins into purses, which were then sealed, thus preserving their full
 weight; as is known, the same was done later in Europe. A Qayrawanese
 merchant, writing from al-Mahdiyya in or around 1063, explains that
 he had changed all the quarter dinars received for his pepper in that
 city into "fresh" Niziri dinars, coins that had been issued under the
 caliph al-'AzTz some seventy years before.39 The purse of 'Azizi dinars,
 sent from Qayrawin around 1020, as mentioned above, page 232, must
 have been of the same "fresh" type. The coins of al-'Aziz' predecessor,
 al-Mu'izz (953-975), form the subject of documents dated 983, 1004,
 1026, and others from the eleventh century; and as late as 1057 a
 banker's account in Fustat notes a purse with 10 "pierced" Mu'izzis
 which arrived from Tunisia and was exchanged with a loss of only 3/4,
 dinar in local Egyptian money.40 The same banker sends Mu'izzI
 quarters together with dinars of the then-ruling caliph al-Mustan~ir
 to the flax center Biil}ir, which shows that those Maghrebi coins were
 accepted as payment by the Egyptian merchants at least eighty years
after they had been minted.n The frequently mentioned 11 old quarters"
 and "old Sicilian quarters" were probably. of the same or a similar
 early Fatimid coinage and had been preserved intact by being enclosed
 in sealed bags. Thus the terms "fresh" and "old," under certain circum-
 stances migh~ have denoted pretty much the same thing. The Norman
 quarter dinars with Arabic legends were called taris. One can hardly
 escape the assumption that this designation was connected with the
term for "fresh" discussed here, namely that the custom of putting
newly minted coins into purses, which then remained sealed, was
particularly common with the early Norman issues. 42
Numismatists and economic historians will have to cooperate in
 order to meaningfully explain the rich information about money chang-
ing contained in the Geniza records. The rates of exchange granted by
the bankers clearly depended not only on the metallic content of the
 coins concerned, but on market conditions and commercial considers-







 tions as well. This may be inferred from the sums quoted and is reflected
 in many express statements. A merchant writing from al-Mahdiyya
asks his business friend in Fustat whether he should not send him his
quarter dinars, since he had heard that they were worth more in Egypt
 than in Tunisia." Maghrebi quarters, once very welcome in Jerusalem,
at a certain time obtained an excessively low price there and their
possessor was advised to forward them to Fustat, where the man in
 charge of the exchange would profitably take care of them." The fol-
lowing quotation from a letter addressed to N ahray b. Nissim is
particularly instructive: "I sent you a purse with 50 dinars which are
out of use [literally: have come to a standstill] here in Alexandria,
but are excellent and first class in Fustat. Please exchange them for
Damascus [or: Syria] dinars whose legends are arranged in lines, good
ones, as I know you are accustomed to procure. I have made an agree-
ment with your brother-in-law that your commission will be one dinar
for a hundred [changed]. I shall send you another purse by the end of
the holidays [a week after the writing of the letter]. Please execute
the order immediately, for I need these coins urgently." 45
 The last three quotations illustrate another aspect of money chang-
ing during the Geniza period. Money changers were found everywhere.
In Alexandria there even existed a suq al-J!ar/1 a changers' bazaar.46
Fustat, however, was the monetary pivot of the Fatimid empire. It
was the piazza, to use an expression familiar from European economic
history, the trading and banking center that alone was able to procure
all the issues needed by the merchants in their f arflung undertakings
and to provide them with a market for exotic, or, as they were called
then, "wild" coins.47 Orders for Syrian money, placed by Alexandrian
merchants in Old Cairo (as the one in the last quotation) were routine,
but we also find orders for silver dirhems, although these came mostly
from the West. 48
 The diir al-J!arfI the Exchange of Fustat, is referred to in the Geniza
papers throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Its bankers
must have had a semiofficial status, as is evident in particular from the
many data we possess about one of them, called Abraham, the Son of
the Scholar. A great many documents ref erring to Abraham or signed
by him, dated between January, 1050, and December, 1093, have been
preserved, for he served, like many other men of affairs, also as judge
of the Jewish community. His address was "The House of Exchange,
dukkiin [office] of Abraham, the Son of the Scholar, the banker." 49
 In one letter he is described as follows: "He is in the Exchange and
enjoys great wealth. May God preserve it for him and guard him from
all enemies and enviers." 50 Such a wish, expressed with regard to a
third person, normally alludes to a man connected with the government
and in danger of becoming a victim of intrigues. He actually incurred
such dangers, as we learn from a letter written by Elijah, the president
of the-Jewish Supreme Court of Jerusalem during the years 1053-1062.







 Abraham evidently had become involved with a woman in Ascalon,
 where he sojourned on business, and his enemies intended to use the
 affair "to engineer his downfall at the government." 51 Admission as a
 member to the Exchange of Fustat seems to have been difficult. Nahray
 b. Nissim, whose activities as money changer and banker can be traced
 through several decades, never succeeded in becoming one. In contracts
 from the years 1158 and 1166-one a loan and the other the sale of a
 slave girl-the occupation of several persons mentioned in them is
 given as "merchant, taji r [ see p. 149} in the dar aHiarf." ·The term
 "merchant-banker," used by me, following others, to denote persons
 dealing both in goods and in money operations, seems to be rendered
 exactly by that twelfth-century title. 52
The exchange rate granted by the banker was called by him either
 by its proper designation: ~arf (from which ~ayrafi, money changer,
 is derived) or, more frequently: si'r, "price," or bay', "sale," which
 were the terms used for the transfer of general goods (cf. above, p.
 218). The difference between the Egyptian dinar and the foreign
 currency, which usually had a lower value, was designated by the term
 waks, "loss." The medieval clerk, in his predilection for variety, in-
 discriminately applied the different tenns of calculating, namely the
 indication of the exchange and that of the ''loss." To this apparent
 confusion the student of such accounts must become accustomed. One
 example illustrates this procedure:

Sale of Tripoli (Lebanon] and Ha.sanI dinars.
31 dinars-Sale [i.e., exchange rate of] 20-¾ qirats per dinar (full worth: 24
 qlriif,s)
 20-½ dinars-Sale 22-½ qirats
8-½-Loss 3-¼ qiriits (which means exactly the same as item one,
 namely an exchange rate of 20-¾ qira!;s]. 53

The item "Loss" usually does not include the banker's commission,
 since references to it appear separately. Thus, in the account just
 quoted, the total of 60 foreign dinars was sold for 53:.% Egyptian
 dinars, a loss of 6-%, to which an item called "addition" amounting
 to 9 qirats, or % dinar, was added. 114 The banker's premium differed
 according to market conditions or other circumstances not yet evident
 to· us. In one single account we find the following notations: 1111

 Change of 145 Damascene "concentric" dinars. Agio: 1-½ dinars.
 11 " 100 11 "lined""" 19-½ qirats.
 11 11 139-½11and 16 Egypt (to Murii.biti) dinars. "1-¾ dinars.

 The average here was 1 percent, whfoh was promised expressly as the
 changer's commission (above, p. 238). In another account of the same
 banker, 1 dinar is charged for an exchange of 67-¾ 2 ·dinars (the type







 of money is not stated), but 1 dinar 19 q'ira,ts for 55 dinars 22 q'irats
 Nizariyya dinars. 56 For smaller sums, it seems, the premium was higher.
 Thus 9- 2 %4 Niziiris, almost IO dinars, were sold without "loss," since
 they represented Fatimid coinage of full weight. But for their conver-
 sion into contemporary, local currency a premium of a quarter dinar,
 2-½ percent,57 was charged. The still smaller sum of 4 dinars changed
 to silver in .July, 1150 (approximately ninety years after the trans-
 action just described) required a charge of 6 dirhems or about 3 per-
 cent.58 It might be noted in passing that the regular term for the
 banker's agio was neither "addition,'' nor "commission," although both
 were occasionally used in this sense, but ~arf, which as we have seen,
 was the general word for exchange rate and for the act of changing
 itself. The context usually indicates which of the three meanings of
 ~arf is intended.
Specialization and division of labor, manifest in many fields of the
 economy reflected in the Geniza, are discernible also with regard to
 money changing. The many documents connected with Nahray b.
 Nissim leave no doubt that he confined himself to Mediterranean
 currencies and solely to those with Arabic legends (which included the
 quarters of the Norman rulers), and that his specific strength was Syro-
 Palestinian issues. Nahray was a member of the Jewish Academy of
 Jerusalem, and, as a pious man, frequently made the pilgrimage to the
 Holy City. Combinjng, as the Muslims did on their pilgrimages, busi-
 ness activities with religious observance, he visited also the Syrian
 cities and became an expert in their currencies. Another example of
 specialization is provided in a letter to the Fayyiim, in which the
 addressee is admonished to refrain from a11 banking dealings with
 the government, but is advised to find a modest, but safe living in the
 change into silver money, ~arf al-fi<Jq,a, in which a partnership of two
 acquaintances earned 3 dinars per week. 59 The cooperation between
 many money changers, demonstrated in detail in the banking accounts
 translated in Mediterranean People, must have been due to this high
 degree of specialization.
Payments by sealed purses and the simultaneous use of different
 currencies alleviated somehow the difficulties inherent in a money
 market ruled by specie. These means of payment, however, were no
 longer sufficient for the comparatively developed and refined society
 known to us from the Geniza papers. Other techniques had to be
 applied. The economy of the period was, to a certain extent, a paper
 economy. Commerce, both wholesale and retail was conducted on credit.
 One did not pay in cash for the daily supplies, but sent the grocer
 written orders, and after a certain number-5, 10, 20--had accumu-
 lated, they were returned and payment was made. From a collection
 of such orders, presently preserved at the British Museum, we learn
 that together with commodities, small amounts of cash were delivered;
 the grocer served, as it were, also as banker."° In such a case we may







 assume that some balance due the customer from a previous payment
 had remained with the grocer.
On bankers proper, we have a collection of twenty orders drawn on
 one banker during one month of the year 1140 by Abii. Zikri Kohen
 of Fustat. With the exception of one payment of 100 dinars, all the
 others are of comparatively small amounts, ranging from 1-¼ to 7
 dinars. In six cases, the purpose of the payment is indicated, for ex-
 ample, for the purchase of a large quantity of grapes (needed for the
 preparation of wine for the household, not for sale) .61
The form of such a medieval order of payment was very similar to a
 modern check. One has only to bear in mind that Hebrew and Arabic
 scripts run from right to left, and not, as Latin characters do, from left
 to right. On the left upper corner the sum to be paid was written in
 numer!lls (not in Hebrew, but in Coptic numerals, which are derived
 from Greek). Then the order followed: "May so-and-so [the issuing
 banker] pay to bearer [ not mentioned by name] such and such an
 amount [in words]." On the left lower corner the date (month and
 year, not the day) was indicated and on the lower edge of the note the
 name of the issuer. Abu Zikri used to head all his orders with the
 Hebrew word for truth, EM eTh. This was meant as an acrostic and
 abbreviation of the first three words of Psalm 85:12: "Emeth Me'ere?
 T4rnalJ, (Truth springs out from the earth)," meaning that any misuse
 of the order of payment would be discovered in due course.
Since paper was expensive, the size of such a note was small, approxi-
 mately half the dimensions of a modern check. The one for 100 dinars
 mentioned above is slightly larger than the average (it measures 3
 by 3-½ inches), but its text was as simple as that of the others:
 "Truth. 100 dinars ['dinars' in Arabic characters, the rest in Hebrew].
 B [a letter forming an abbreviation of the Aramaic formula: In Your
 name, oh Merciful]. May the elder Abu '1-Kayr Khiyar pay to bearer
 one hundred dinars for the house [i.e., the wife] of Amin al-Dawla.
 Ab 1451 [July-August, 1140]. Abii Zikri Kohen." The following order
 by another merchant has a more personal touch: "May the elder Abu
 'l-'Ala-may God, the exalted, grant him success-pay to bearer in
 waraq silver one hundred and twenty-two. His friend [no date]."
 The name of the merchant, Abu 'I-Faraj, was written by the banker in
 the right (we would do it in the left) lower corner on a slanting line.
 Abu 'I-Faraj did not sign his name himself, because his handwriting
 was testimony enough to his being the issuer of the order. In letter
 writing, referring to oneself not by name, but by an attribute expressing
 friendship or gratitude, was a delicacy habitual among friends. 62
Legally, orders of payment were a form of transfer of debt or assign-
 ment, lJ,awala (a word, by the way, from which French aval, endorse-
 ment on a bill of exchange, is derived) .63 We read much about this way
 of avoiding cash payment in the Geniza papers. "The purchasers of the
 pearls transferred the payment to those to whom they had sold aromatic







balls," writes a merchant from Alexandria, complaining that one of his
business friends had succeeded only partially in collecting debts from
the latter, and on his side was slow in paying 40 dinars he owed the
writcr. 64 The transfer of a debt was made before a court or notary. One
such document from 1133 states that the ultimate responsibility rested
with the original debtor. 65 Debts could be transferred to a pious founda-
tion and even a government office, 66 but the normal procedure, of course,
was to have them paid through a banker. "He [a Maghrebi merchant]
sold part [ of a quantity of flax] in Tyre and part in al-Ladhiqiyya
[both on the Lebanese-Syrian coast]. He promised to pay the price in
Fustat and transfered the debt to Nahray b. Nissim for payment in
excellent dinars of full weight. Of these, I received 13 from Abraham,
son of Isaac, the Scholar, and the balance of 27 from Nahray." This
statement of release was made out in summer, 1052, in two copies, one
for the Maghrebi merchant and one for Nahray. Abraham, the Son of
the Scholar, the banker about whom we have read (above, p. 238), acted
solely as partial substitute for the latter.67 This release illustrates still
another aspect of the transfer of debt, namely, payment in another city
or country (cf. above, p. 200).
 How the l)awala on a banker worked in daily life is well illustrated
by the following bi11, submitted to Abu Zikri Kohen, whom we have just
met: "May our master Judah [Abu Zikri's Jewish name]-may his
Rock [God] preserve him-write to the elder Abu 'l-Khayr Khiyar
[his banker, cf. above] an order of payment on 6-¼ dinars for 3 irdabbs
of wheat. And Peace," and signed in full by the sender. Beneath this,
in the right lower corner (leaving the left and main corner free), the
receiver wrote: "Change it to his favor with your signature. Abu Zikri
Kohen," that is, sign the receipt in your name. 68
 The term for order of payment, ruq'a, is Arabic and simply means
piece of paper, note. From this general term, ~he suftaja, a Persian word
usually translated as bill of exchange, is to be differentiated. This
translation of suftaja should not imply that the bearer of such docu-
ments expected to be paid in the currency of the country to which he
proceeded, for the many references to suftajas in the Geniza never
contain an element of money changing. On the contrary. One wished to
receive exactly the type of money one paid to the issuing banker. "He
owes me a suftaja on 123 Mustan~iri dinars, 75 of which new dinars and
the rest Syro-Palestinian ones," writes a merchant who had traveled to
Tinnis, the industrial and commercial center on the eastern arm of the
Nile which was frequented by the Syro-Palestinian merchants. In
Baghdad a traveler en route from that city to Cairo paid Maghrebi
dinars described by him in detail for two suftajas he carried with him. 69
 Muslim lawyers defined the suftaja as a uloan of money in order to
avoid the risk of transport." 70 As far as the Geniza papers are con-
cerned, the term was used in a more restricted sense. Payment through a
third party in another city fell under the general category of transfer







of debt. The suftajas were of a more special character. AB a rule they
were issued by and drawn upon well-known bankers or representatives
of merchants, a fee was charged for their issue, and after presentation a
daily penalty had to be paid for any delay in payment. Under cer-
tain circumstances, merchants and even government offices preferred
suftajas to cash, but they werc:l not always easy to come by. A re-
spectable merchant from Alexandria writes around 1100 to the opulent
purplecloth maker 'Arus b. Joseph in Old Cairo: 11 I have sent the
amount in ca.sh with so-and-so. May God ordain his safe arrival. Had I
found someone who would have been prepared to take out a suftaja in
Old Cairo [i.e., to make the payment there] and to receive the equiva-
lent here, I would have done so. However, I was unable to find any." "1
This sounds as if at that time no banker issued suftajas in Alexandria.
In a letter from Qayrawin, written around 1050, the addressee in Fustat
is urgently requested "to approach and to implore" Ibn 'Allan, a well-
known fin~ncier, to accept ready cash for a bill of exchange to be sent to
Ashmiinayn, so that the writer's representatives, whom he had left there
in order to buy flax, should have no difficulty with their transactions.T2
In another letter, the musta'mil kattiin, the government agent charged
with the sale of flax in B~ir, is promised a suftaja on 30 dinars drawn
on the same banker.7·3 Finally, after having received 123 dinars in cash
for the issue of a bill, Ibn 'Allin, as we have seen, was late in forwarding
it to his customer in Tinnis. According to Ibn 'Allin's customer, such a
delay, if brought to court, was punishable by a daily fine of 5 dinars,
which he waived, however, in deference to the great banker.''
 Another banker of Fustat, lbn Sha'ya (Isaiah) is represented in the
Geniza by at least five suftajas drawn on him. His partner writes to
him from Damascus: crAbu Man~ur asked me to take from him 25
dinars and 2 qirat,s, which I did and for which I wrote him a bill drawn
on you." 75 The same partner reports from the Egyptian town Malij: "If
our customer presses me to pay him immediately, I shall write him a
suftaja drawn on you. Otherwise, I shall give him a purse of gold" (i.e.,
after two months or so, as usual) .'8 This p~ssage illustrates the cash
value of the suftaja, which also explains why a fine was imposed on any
delay in payment. "The bill arrived on the holiday [ and, therefore, was
not paid; it was payable, it seems, to a government office]. Immediately
mounted police were sent out carrying an order for a fine of 6 dirhems
per day." TT The amount of the bill concerned was 120 dinars. Should
we assume that a fine of 1 dirhem was charged per day for the delay in
payment of 20 dinars, a favorite round sum (cf. above, p. 233)? This
administrative fine, tarsim, which usually amounted to a few dirhems,
must be differentiated from the cost of' a lawsuit, tawkil, which the
banker Ibn 'Allan would have had to pay, had his delay in issuing the
bill been brought to court. 18
 No details concerning a commission for the issue of a bill of exchange
have been found thus far. The fact itself may be inferred from tlie







 following letter written in Jerusalem in or around 1052. After having
 reported that he collect~d a debt of 5 dinars due his Cairene friend,
 the writer continues: "This is not a sum on which it is worthwhile to
 write a bill of exchange. However, if you approve, I shall give the
 money to Arrajani [a Persian Jewish banker] and make out a suftaja
 for only a slight loss, for he claims to be a business friend of Abraham,
 son of Isaac, the Scholar [the Fustat money changer, repeatedly re-
 ferred to above]." 79 The meaning of the passage seems to be that the
 Persian banker would not need to buy the suftaj a from a great banker
 to whom he would have to pay a high commission, but draw it on his
 Fus tat friend, who would charge only a modest fee for this service.
Since the presentation of a bill of exchange required immediate pay-
 ment, even great bankers refrained from issuing suftajas on large
 sums. The three Tustari brothers in Fustat certainly constituted a most
 powerful firm (cf. above, p. 164). When an old man from northern
 Iran was on his way to Egypt, however, the Baghdad correspondent of
 the Tustaris issued him a suftaja on 100 dinars drawn on the latter, and
 one on 50 dinars on another, also a well-known Fustat banker. For
 Damascus, which the traveler had to pass on his journey, he did not
 receive a suftaja at all, but was advised to produce the one drawn on
 the Tustaris to their representative in that city, who would pay him
 after having contacted his business friends. 80
The material about suftajas in Islamic literature, carefully assembled
 by A. Mez, shows that they could be sent over long distances, but only
 where direct and permanent business connections existed, such as be-
 tween Aswan, the terminus of the voyage on the Nile, and 'Aydhab, the
 port on the Red Sea, or Sijilmasa on the northern fringe of the Sahara
 Desert .and a town on its southern border in the western Sudan.81 A
 similar picture emerges from the Geniza documents. Many letters from
 Tunisia show that the Jews of that country were very eager that their
 donations for the Jewish academies of Baghdad should reach that city
 safely and in time. But all they could do was send purses with gold to
 Fustat .and have their equivalent forwarded to Baghdad in suftajas
(or purses, at that). 82 We read that a gift to the poor of Jerusalem by a
 man from Toledo, Spain, was deposited with a banker in Fustat; how
 it was transferred there is not reported. The banker handed it in cash
 to the head of the Palestinian congregation in the Egyptian capital,
 and the latter paid the sum to one of the Tustari brothers, who for-
 warded it to Jerusalem by suftaja. 88 We frequently read about suftajas
 on comparatively small sums of 10-19-½ dinars sent from Old Cairo to
 Jerusalem. Presumably, the issuing bankers did not charge a commis-
 sion because the money was destined for pious purposes. Their reward
 was the prayers said for them at the holy sites. In one letter from
 Jerusalem, a suftaja on 10 dinars is returned to Old Cairo because the
 person on whom it was drawn disclaimed any obligation on his side
 toward the issuer. 84







 Nothing seems to indicate that these bills were transferable. When a
bill, payable to a person in Jerusalem, but drawn on a banker in Ramie
arrived, we read: "The suftaja has arrived. R. Abraham has asked him
to cash it in Ramie and to pay the money here [in Jerusalem]." 85
Sometimes bankers granted advances on suftajas whose issue had been
announced to them but which had not yet arrived. One such case refers
to Tyre, Lebanon.86
Silk, as explained above (p. 222), was regarded during the Fatimid
period almost like cash. Therefore, we are not surprised to find a
suftaja issued on that commodity. The writer of an unfortunately
much-mutilated letter explains that he had intended to send gold to the
customer concerned, but was afraid that the representative of mer-
chants in Tinnis would find fault with his dinars; therefore he preferred
to make out a suftaja on 30 small [i.e., Egyptian] pounds of silk
yarn.s1
A merchant-banker like N ahray b. Nissim, while out of town on a
business trip, could issue a suftaja to be paid by him in Fustat. Payment
had to be made in time, though, whe~her he had succeeded in returning
home or not. This is evident from a letter of his in which he most
 urgently requests a relative in charge of his affairs to realize a bill of his
 amounting to 44 dinars. 88
Our survey has shown that the use of suftajas was fairly well de-
 veloped, especially inside Egypt itself, between Egypt and its immedi-
 ate eastern neighbors,89 and between international centers such as Cairo
 and Baghdad. If compared with the circulation of purses, however, the
 remittance by suftajas appears to have been rather restricted. The
 reason for this limitation was perhaps the necessity for the banker to
 be highly liquid, which meant to forego investment, the very opposite
 of sound business, as the Geniza people saw it. It is particularly note-
 worthy that on the main trade route, namely that between the Muslim
 West and Egypt, no suftajas are mentioned at all, as against countless
 purses that went not only from the West to the East, but also in the
 opposite direction. In a letter from around 1063, a merchant from
 Tripoli, Libya, sent a ~akka, or note (from this Persian word the
 European check is derived) on 200 dinars to Fustat. But Tripoli, at
 that time, belonged to Egypt rather than to the Muslim West, and in
 the same letter, the writer, who sojourned in Sicily, dispatched 400
 dinars in cash to the same destination. 90
Still, our statement that the Geniza documents to a large extent
 :reflect a paper economy holds true. This was due not so much to the role
 of the suftaja, which. was limited in scope, but to that of the ruq'a in
 its double meaning of order of payment or delivery, given to a grocer,
 merchant, or banker, which we discussed above, and of the promissory
 note, to which we now turn. Promissory notes by bankers were regarded
 as cash. When Nahray had to realize his suftaja of 44 dinars about
 which we have read above, he did so with three notes worth 20-¾, 18,







 and 4-½ 2 dinars, respectively and only the remaining sum of less than
 2 dinars was paid in specie. 91 From the same letter we learn that he even
 paid for the toll in Rosetta and for his purchases on the flax exchange
 in notes, while he himself was in receipt of notes from the Manak house,
 another well-known exchange in Fustat. A hundred years later, in fall
 1162, a man who had farmed the revenue from houses belonging to a
 pious foundation hands over to its cashier 20 dinars, 17 in bankers'
 notes, riqii' ~ayiirif, and the rest in gold.92 In a similar case, in July,
 1151, the total amount due-220 dirhems--was paid in a note drawn
 on a banker specified by name. 93 Such a ruq'a could be sent out of
 town. "I sent you a banker's note in payment for the copying of the
 books." 94 These notes were negotiable, or, as our documents say, they
 could be "bought." We remember, of course, that the same expression
 could be applied to dinars and dirhems ( ci. p. 230). In a court record
 from August, 1112, of which only the end has been preserved, a man
 bought with a ruq'a worth 5 dinars two others, worth 3 and 2 re-
 spectively, and produced another one, also on 5 dinars. Thus, the total
 sum of 10 dinars, the object of litigation, was in notes.95
Naturally, a banker could issue promissory notes only to a person
 for whom he had received payments or, who had deposits with him, or
 otherwise was his customer, mu'amil, an important relationship in the
 banking business. 96 It was customary to keep part of one's money with a
 banker. The sugar merchant whose deathbed declaration has been re-
 ferred to above (p. 152), concludes his statement with the remark: "I
 have a deposit with Abu Na~r, the banker, to the amount of 700 dirhems.
 They shall be used to meet my obligations." 97 In a list of about seventy
 pledges to a public appeal, al-J:Ialabi ("the man from Aleppo") 1 the
 ~ayrafi, and his partners donate 1 dinar, and so do two other bankers.
 Six persons, pledging smaller sums (¼-½ dinars), among them a
 purple-cloth merchant, an apothecary, a druggist, and a female broker,
 refer for payment to al-J:Ialabi and Company, while others do the same
 with regard to three other bankers, also appearing as donors.98 The
person~ referring to bankers during the drive did so because they did
not want to be bothered again when the pledges became due. But we
may safely assume that many made their payments in the same way at
 the time of the collection. Of particular relevance to our topic is a
 statement about the estate of a rich goldsmith made in August, 1114.
 As first item, before cash and before the jewelry, t.hirteen promissory
notes, amounting to 1,054- 1 ½2 dinars are listed. With the exception of
 three notes totaling 38-½ dinars only, all of them were issued by two
bankers, father and son, known from other Geniza documents. Some
notes were dated January, February, and June, 1114, respectively; one,
amounting to 100 dinars, May, 1113; for the rest no dates are indicated.
Most significantly, at the end of the long statement, there again appear
 promissory notes (of small amounts, ranging from ½ to 16 dinars).
 These were loans, or rather balances of loans, partly repaid, which had







 been granted by the deceased to merchants, artisans, and private per-
 sons.99 "Note and signatures [i.e., bonds signed] by customers," as well
 as "collaterals and signatures" are prominent in another document
 dealing with an estate, of which, however, only a fragment has sur-
 vived.100
The Geniza papers nowhere indicate that the banker charged for his
 services as a clearinghouse for payments or for keeping deposits. His
 compensation obviously came from the advantages of having cash at
 hand. The depositor, on his side, enjoyed the benefits of convenient
 payments by ruq'as, as explained above (p. 241), and occasionally he
 could also make an overdraft, as is evident from one account.101
What were the banker's profits from the cash deposits? First, we
 remember, the banker was a money changer, and for this service he
 charged. In order to acquire a stock of foreign currencies (which was
 not always easy to come by), the ~ayrafi had to have capital. He could
 invest his own money, as is demonstrated in the documents on partner-
 ship in banking.102 In one such contract (from the eleventh century),
 the senior partner contributed 500 dinars, a sum that must be regarded
 as considerable, the more so as that banker was simultaneously engaged
 in other business ventures. 103 In addition, and perhaps mainly, a banker
 relied on the cash deposited with him, as is palpably evident from
 tbe case of a fledgling ~ayrafi whose own capital was negligible.104
Secondly, a banker of higher standing used to issue suftajas, which
 service, as we have tried to show, carried a substantial fee. Thirdly, he
 was a moneylender, an activity shown as being his regular business by
 the documents dealing with partnership in banking. In two such con-
 tracts, the senior partner reserves himself the right of granting loans,
 salaf; in a third, a former partner complains that loans were given
 without his consent.105 We deal with this question of loans and interest,
 which is not confined to bankers, in a separate section, but one variety
 of loans was specifically connected with the ~ayrafi as the handler of
 specie and, therefore, must be considered here. One banker's ledger
 shows a great many payments of 1 dinar less 1 qirat or their multiples
 to 38 customers, all bearing non-Jewish names. This cannot be acci-
 dental, but suggests a case of concealed interest. The difference between
 the nominal and the actual weight constituted the banker's profit. The
 customer, as is known from numerous other documents, deposited with
 the banker a piece of jewelry or another security and drew cash when-
 ever he needed it. The banker kept in his drawers coins that had lost
 some of their weight or adjusted the account in subsequent payments,
 as is shown in the ledger concerned in the example of a customer who
 appears in it ten times.108
Finally, a banker, like any other businessman, invested the money
 at his disposal in partnerships and commendas, and this was perhaps
 one of the main benefits he derived from the sums deposited with him.
 Nahray b. Nissim, whose activities are best known to us, can serve as an







 example. The material related to him is equally distributed between
 banking and commercial undertakings. This multiple combination of
 assaying, changing, lending, and clearing, joined with trading in goods,
 made the banking business very complicated. Each of these operations,
 in particular moneylending, clearing, and investment in commercial
 ventures, had its risks. We are not surprised, therefore, to meet with
 cases of bankruptcy. "Abu '1-Ma'ali, the ~ayrafi [a Muslim or Chris-
 tian) went broke and died on the same day; he owed 1,000 dinars, of
 these, 600-to Jews, 27-to me," we read in a letter from Alexandria
 from the beginning of the twelfth century.101 In a will made shortly after
 1100, the testator notes that he had invested 300 dinars in a partnership
 with the banker Abu 'l-J.Jusayn al-J.Jalabi {not necessarily identical
 with the one mentioned above, p. 246; many immigrants from Aleppo
 were bankers), but had little hope to retrieve that money. A.bu
 'l-J.Jusayn's son, also a banker, died, after a prolonged illness, without
 leaving a penny so that the court had to fix child support for his infant
 daughter. The exceptionally elaborate style and calligraphic execution
 of the document prove that it was made in behalf of a family that had
 seen better days (Dec., 1120). In a fourth document from that period, a
 calligraphic and eloquent, but incomplete, letter from a provincial
 town, the dire lot of a bankrupt banker is described. He is praised as a
 decent man of excellent conduct who had done only good to everyone,
 but was unable to meet his obligations (a sum of 100 dinars is men-
 tioned) because his customers, who were rough people, were remiss in
 their payments to him. He was brought before the head of the local
 police, flogged, tortured, and put into prison with his hands and feet
chained for an indefinite period. The letter is an appeal to a notable to
 get him out of this misery.108
 In general, the banker's vocation was highly honored in the Jewish
community. Like those of the physician and the government official,
the profession of the banker was called by its Hebrew name, not only
 in Hebrew documents, but occasionally even in those written in
Arabic. 109 (The Hebrew word, shullpini, "the man with the table," is
pre-Islamic; it is a translation from Greek.) Letters to bankers are
styled in terms of great deference.no Communal leaders were often
chosen from their ranks.
 The need for capital and perhaps also the complicated nature of the
banking business were conducive to cooperation. References to partner-
ships in banking are frequent.m In addition to the variegated activities
described in the preceding pages, one contract imposes on the junior
partner to appear in court for the company. Since a document had to be
made out before a court or by a notary for each loan, and since com-
plaints about tardy creditors were legion, such appearances must have
been daily routine.112
 A banker in government service, fulfilling the tasks of cashier (or







treasurer), money changer, and accountant, was called jahbadh.us As
with the term kiitib, "scribe," which could denote an all-powerful
minister and a minor clerk, a jahbadh could be a highly influential
person in a government or a little cashier handling three dirhems.m
In a letter to the community of Sahrajt in Lower Egypt, the Nagid
Judah b. Saadya expresses his astonishment that they had not yet
settled a case of inheritance involving the sister of a great jahbadh,
who acted for them at the government whenever they needed help and
"out of fear of whose word they were treated with respect by their
neighbors." 115 Because of the importance of the office, its holder could
bear the Hebrew title gizbiir ("treasurer," which, by the way, is Persian,
like j ahbadh), as we find in a document from Damascus, dated 1095,
referring to such a prominent treasurer. 116 No wonder that a person
bragging about this office where it did not amount to much was nick-
named juhaybidh, "little jahbadh," found in two documents of the
eleventh century. 117
 A jahbadh was present wherever payments were made to a govern-
ment office. Together with the toll at the port of Old Cairo one paid a
small fee, called jahbadha, to the accountant. 118 The jahbadh at the
flax exchange served also as money changer, handling large sums of
freshly minted dinars. 119 When one bought flax from a government es-
tate in an Egyptian village, the procedure was as follows, as we read in
a letter from Fustat: "I paid to the jahbadh here and he entered 500
dinars on our account in the daybook (riiz-nama, a Persian termJ of
the jahbadh of the diwan al-nafaqiit, the Office of Expenditure. Against
this, Bushrii.n, the jahbadh, took out official receipts and handed over
to me receipts with his signature amounting to 200 dinars for the
farmers of Dandir [the village where the flax was bought], which l
forwarded to you." 120 This Bushran, who had his office in Fustat, dealt
also with the suftaja of 120 dinars discussed above, page 243. The
jahbadh of the Office of Expenditure had his seat in Cairo, but used to
"come down 11 to Fustat and keep office hours there for the convenience
of the local merchants.121
 As common in the Fatimid administration, these jahbadhs were not
merely government officials with a fixed salary, if at all, but were also
permitted to engage in business on their own account. This is well illus-
trated by a large and carefully executed document in which the em-
ployee of a jahbadh, after the termination of his service, releases his
employer from any obligation that might have resulted from their
former relationship. Moses, "the fine young man, son of Yeshii'i, the
elder," makes the following declaration: "I have served our master and
teacher Abu Ghalib Elazar, the Prince of the Munificent and Pride of
the Noble ... , in the jahbadha and also in sale and purchase, tak-
ing and giving, for salary and remuneration and have received all due
to me." In his declaration, Moses releases also the sons and brothers







 of his former employer, which shows that the jahbadha, like any other
 profession, could be a family affair. The document is from December,
 1124.122
 All references to jahbadhs in the Geniza are from the eleventh and
early twelfth centuries. There are none from the thirteenth. Another
term, which is not found earlier, becomes common in this century:
naqqad, assayer of money. Since naqqiids appear in lists together with
~ayrafis, we must conclude that their functions differed. Naqqids most
probably assumed, at least in part, the role the jahbadhs had filled in
earlier centuries. At each payment to a government office the money
delivered had to be examined; this would explain the term. Naqqiids
are mentioned in lists of contributors (in one list three appear at once)
or as persons effecting private transactions. An 'ari/ al-naqqiidin, or
head of their profession, contributed once only a quarter dinar (he
obviously knew the value of money). No documents illustrating the
professional activities of a naqqiid have been traced thus far.1 23
 Debts and loans.-An unusually large amount of Geniza documents
deals with credit. This material may be roughly divided into three
groups. The first and most frequently represented type is that of the
"acknowledgment" [iqriir), a legal instrument of a rather technical and
abstract character. The debtor declares to owe such and such a sum to
the creditor and explains when and how he will pay it back, often in
installments. He stands security for the sum owed with all his posses-
sions, including "his garment on his shoulders" (an Aramaic expression
in otherwise mostly Arabic or Hebrew documents) and the same applies
to his heirs. The creditor is freed from all oaths and, 01_1 his side, declares
to have no other claims against the debtor. Sometimes special conditions
are added, for example, that only repayments entered on the reverse
side of the document are regarded as having been properly made, or
 (not common) penalties for delays are stipulated. All this is clad in
extensive legal verbiage. The notion "I owe" is always expressed in a
number of phrases, both Arabic and Hebrew, sometimes amounting to
fifteen and more words. Of course, the general conditions of a contract,
such as the mental and physical health of the party making the
acknowledgment, his acting in freedom and not under coercion or
duress, and so on, are present as well. Documents of this type never
tell us under which circumstances a debt was incurred or a loan was
given (or, indeed, whether one or the other forms the subject of the
declaration), but they are not without value, inasmuch as they provide
us with exact details concerning the parties, sums, and dates involved.:w
 The second group comprises settlements and special arrangements
connected with previous obligations. Often a third party is involved.
The complicated nature of the documents of this type is recognizable
in the following examples. The banker Ibn Sunaynii.t had granted a
loan of 300 dinars to a father and son, each being responsible for the
whole sum, which was to be paid back in six yearly installments of 50







 dinars. The two served also as agents for the banker in a commercial
 deal with a third party. Together with two releases necessitated by that
 deal, the debt, whose contract originally had been drawn up by a Mus-
 lim notary and before a Jewish court, was now reconfirmed (June,
 1129) .125 A merchant in al-Mal}alla had owed 1,330 dirhems (as testified
 in a Muslim ~ujja, or acknowledgment), of which sum be had paid back
 1,017 dirhems. After the death of the creditor he claimed that each of
 the two heirs owed him certain sums, which one of the latter flatly
 denied, while the other made counterclaims. The court decided that the
 two heirs had to confirm their assertions by oath, albeit each by a
 different oath, while the debtor had to pay immediately the balance
 conceded by him (it was 107 dirhems). If he failed to do so, he would
 be fined an additional like sum payable to the communal chest (Jan.,
 1144) .126 The recipient of a loan of 260 dinars (on condition to return it
 in one payment at any time requested) delivers to the creditor a bill of
 debt on 100 dinars owed to him by a Muslim merchant. The Muslim
 was expected back from his travels any time, and since he was a
 ma'rifa, or business friend, of the creditor, it was assumed that the
 latter would have no difficulty in collecting from him that sum, which
 would serve as a partial reimbursement. Clearly, the debtor was unable
 to meet the stipulations of his contract (March, 1229) .127
Finally, debts are referred to in a great variety of documents, such
 as wills, deathbed declarations, inventories of estates or possessions,
 accounts, and letters. These references naturally are not as complete
 as formal acknowledgments, but frequently compensate for this de-
 ficiency by instructive details normally not found in more technical
 legal instruments.
In two of the three examples for the second group of documents dis-
 cussed above, the acknowledgments were made before both Muslim and
 Jewish authorities. This practice was widespread. The same lbn Su-
 naynat whom we have found granting a loan of 300 dinars to a family
 partnership of father and son, owed 440 dinars to a rich tax-farmer;
 the debt was acknowledged in two Arabic 1}.ujjas and in one Hebrew
 shetiir.128 Even when the beadle of a synagogue, who seems to have
acted as a communal cashier, granted a loan of 28-¼ dinars (certainly
 30 coins were delivered) to the son of a Jewish judge, acknowledgment
 was made through a Muslim notary.129 In general, Jewish authorities
 condemned and even punished recourse to Muslim courts, but they did
 not object to this practice of contracting debts through Muslim agen-
 cies. The reason for this leniency was obvious. Such acknowledgments,
 as we have seen, were negotiable, they could be used as a means of
 payments, and there was, of course, no point in confining them to the
 Jewish community. Why, then, were so many contracts of loans made
 out before Jewish courts, even when a similar document had already
 been issued by a Muslim notary and testified by Muslim witnesses?
The answer to this question is comparatively simple in BUcb cases







 where the Geniza document reports about an additional action with
 regard to a debt previously contracted through a Muslim authority.
 "A fine young man" owed to another one of the same description, a
 dyer, 660 dirhems, as attested in a Muslim lmjja. In the Geniza docu-
 ment he receives an additional 155 dirhems from the same creditor and
 promises to return the total amount of 815 dirhems in one payment
 whenever requested (spring, 1220) .180 The physician of a battleship had
 granted loans in the amount of 26 dinars and "some seventy" dirhems
 to a Mr. Duck through an "Arabic ):mjja." After a "deep-searching
 inquiry" by a Jewish court into the financial capacity of the debtor,
 the physician acquiesced in being reimbursed in installments of a.
 quarter dinar per month, which meant during a period of about ten
 years (Dec., 1129) .131 Another document reveals that a settlement pro-
 viding for a repayment of a debt of 183 dinars during six years (15-¼
 dinars at the end of every six months) had been made before a Muslim
 court. The Geniza document confirms this arrangement, but adds that
 all other records connected with the case are now invalid, and that the
 creditor's partner is to be included in the agreement (July, 1156).1a2
 In general, however, we can only surmise why so many loans were
 contracted before a Jewish court despite the obvious advantage of
 having them registered in more widely negotiable documents. The sub-
 sequent discussion of the economic function and import of credit, as
 evident from the Geniza, will contribute to the elucidation of this prob-
 lem.
 Debts often resulted from commercial relationships. They repre-
 sented the conversion of an agreement on deferred payment into a
 negotiable instrument. When one of two partners who had jointly built
a house bought the other's share for 300 dinars, he promised to pay in
 three installments, the first after a month, the two. others after five
 months each (fall, 1139) .188 A broker, simsar, received a loan of 400
 "cut up" dirhems from a physician, who had sold him qand wa-qafiira,
 types of sugar and sugar molasses. In the thirteenth century, sugar
factories became a favorite and fashionable form of investment, re-
peatedly mentioned as owned by physicians. The debt was to be paid
back in October, 1225.u' One document, of fifty-two closely written
lines of legal verbiage, concerns the settlement of the debt of half a
dinar owed after the purchase of 1-½ hundredweights of flax (worth
about 14 dinars [1088] ). 1311 Other acknowledgments of debts also state
that they resulted from sales to the debtor.* It stands to reason, how-
ever, that some of the acknowledgments even though they do not con-
tain such specifications refer to similar relationships.
 As for loans proper, it is useful (albeit not always possible) to dis-
tinguish between those given to help relatives, friends, or needy people,
and others to finance commercial undertakings. Owing to the principle
of having one's capital working all the time and other circumstances,
even well-to-do persons were not rarely short of cash. "I take one dinar







from this friend and two dinars from that," writes a Tunisian merchant
from a business trip to Biii;;ir around 1050, "but cannot go on like this
all the time." 137 Such a situation is vividly illustrated in a deathbed
declaration made in March, 1182r by a person who obviously was sud-
denly overcome by a fatal disease. The most prominent intellectuals of
the period, Jewish and Muslim, were his creditors: Moses Maimonides
with 2-½ dinars and another sum that the testator did not remember;
Ibn Sana' al-Mulk, the Muslim chief justice of Egypt and poet laureate
 (who eulogized Maimonides in a famous poem) with 1 dinar and 12
dirhems; Ibn Jumay', Sultan Saladin's court physician and renowned
medical author and teacher with 4-¼ dinars, advanced for the dying
man's poll tax, who thus belonged to the class of the richest taxpayers,
and the price of a quantity of wheat; another Muslim divine with 4
dinars; and an otherwise unknown gentleman.11111 No wonder that we
find in the Geniza letters asking for smaller loans without much ado,
either naming a sum (e.g., 60 dirhems) or not. 189 Requests for larger
sums and those submitted by poorer people are usually accompanied by
 the offer of collateral.140
Loans for commercial purposes appear sporadically in the Geniza
 in the tenth century. The rich business correspondence of the eleventh
 century makes very little mention of them, so that we are left with the
 impression that they cannot have been of great importance at that
 early period. At all times it seems to have been customary for partners
 to grant loans to their prospective or current associates (cf. above, p.
 179). In the twelfth century, and in particular in its second half, com-
 mercial credit becomes more prominent and seems partly to replace the
 previously paramount practices of partnerships and commendas. The
 following selection from the relevant material illustrates this develop-
 ment.
In May, 967, a Qayrawiinese merchant receives in Old Cairo a loan of
 600 pieces of nuqra silver to be paid back in Qayrawiin immediately at
 request. The creditor, traveling to the same city, accepts as security 12
 mann (about 24 pounds) of nutmeg, which he takes with him on his
 journey to Tunisia. 141 In a magnificent document, written in 974, a
 merchant in Old Cairo releases another from a debt of 85 dinars. 142 In
 an equally beautiful and elaborate, but mutilated court record from
April, 983, a loan of 75 dinars is given for two months.143 In spring,
1017, a prominent member of the Fustat Jewish community receives a
Joan of 30 dinars from a Tunisian merchant through the latter's repre-
sentative, to be repaid after twelve months., In a postscript, written a
year later, this representative acknowledges the receipt of 16 dinars and
guarantees the payment of the balance for another year. The original
document is signed by every one oi consequence in the community
known to us from that period. 1 " Another loan of 30 dinars, to be repaid
in ten monthly installments, is contracted in Fustat in summer, 1028,
by a banker who bore a Tunisian name and, as we know from two other







 court records, was married in the Egyptian capital.145 All these docu-
 ments are composed in the Hebrew language. In a letter from the same
 period, an Old Cairene merchant sojourning in Alexandria informs his
 correspondent in the capital that he had received a loan of 80 dinars
("in weight," bil-~anja) from a compatriot and asks that all consign-
 ments to himself should be turned over to his creditor. The letter over-
 flows in expressions of gratitude for the loan granted, which seems to
 indicate that loans of this type, albeit commercial, were given as a
 favor and means of mutual help rather than for interest of any kind.141
This was certainly the case with regard to money advanced by
 relatives connected by common commercial undertakings. A merchant
 writing from Tunisia thanks his brother-in-law in Egypt for an advance
 granted by him for the purchase of 18 bales of flax, then worth about
 700 dinars, while, later in the letter, he alludes to a loan of 300 dinars
 that he had given to the same brother-in-law, with which oil was
 bought in Tunisia in the same year. Again, in a different context, men-
 tion is made of an advance of 400 quarters to the son of his brother-in-
 law. Many, and rather exact accounts, some specifying ½ 2 dinar, are
 contained in the letter. Had there been any monetary compensation for
 the advances the letter would not have failed to list them.1" A similar
 impression is gained from two extensive (but incomplete) agreements
 from the year 1066 between a nephew and his uncle. The first, dated
 March 12, states that all obligations resulting from the work of the
 two in the caliphal mint will be borne by them in equal shares. More-
 over, the nephew acknowledges to have received everything due him out
 of his father's estate from his uncle and the latter's wife (who is men-
 tioned three times), but grants him a loan of 1,000 dinars as a Jewish
 loan.148 In the second document, dated December 29, the nephew ac-
 knowledges to have received back 500 dinars on Hanukkah (a holiday
 that ended the day before) and that the remaining 500 would be paid
 next Hanukkah.119
Craftsmen, too, seem to have assisted each other with interest-free
 loans. A Muslim mayiiziri, or maker of mi'zars ("waist cloths"), ac-
 knowledges-of course through a Muslim notary-in 1058 to have re-
 ceived from a Jewish mayaziri a loan of 150 dirhems.150 A Jewish ka'ki,
 or maker of cakes, pays back to a Muslim farran, or bread-baker, a loan
 granted by the latter.151 A Jewish glassmaker receives from another
 Jew, nicknamed shatranji, chessplayer, a loan of 5 dinars through a
 Muslim notary .m We remember that such sums were sufficient to keep a
 small workshop running.
The scene changes in the course of the twelfth century. It is unlikely
 that large amounl:.s, such as 300 or 183 dinars, were lent for a duration
 of six years, as we have found above on pages 250 and 252, without
 compensation in interest or service. The second of the two contracts
 referred to is from July, 1156. From the same year, another loan to be
 repaid in six years is attested in the Geniza. It was granted by a woman







 to a man and his mother under joint responsibility. The original note
 of the judge says: 11 27 Dinars, to be repaid in half-yearly installments
 of ½ dinar." A postscrip~ says, however, that the document, shetar, to
 be issued will state that ½ dinar will have to be paid every month
 during six years. This makes 36 dinars and constitutes outright interest
 of about 11 percent per year. 153
Such a flagrant breach of Jewish (and of course, also Muslim and
 Christian) law has been found thus far only once in the record book
 of a judge. One wonders, however, whether such arrangements were not
 made out of court and even without the knowledge of the authorities,
 especially in the case of long-term loans. The following examples arc
 perhaps such cases. Two government officials make a loan of 54 dinars,
 belonging to them in equal shares to be returned in monthly install-
 ments of 2 dinars, 1 to each (Nov., 1170) .154 A silk-weaver receives 552
 dirhems, of which he is to return 10 in each of the first three months and
 then 20 each month. In a postscript, written seven months later by
 Abraham Maimonides in person, the monthly payment is reduced to
 10 dirhems (spring and Dec., 1210) .155 An uncle owes his nephew 200
 dinars and 100 irdabbs of fresh wheat, worth about another 200 dinars,
 to be repaid in five years, in addition to a sum of 6,690 dirhems which
 resulted from dealings of the uncle with his nephew's deceased father
 and which were to be repaid in various shorter periods (spring, 1214).
 Three other acknowledgments from the years 1214--1216 concern loans
 granted by the nephew to his uncle, one amounting to 600 dinars. 156 The
 stipulation repeatedly found in documents of this period that repay-
 ments were to begin with the Muslim New Year (the month of
 Mu}Jarram) possibly emphasizes the investment aspect of a loan. Ac-
 counting was made according to the Muslim year, and therefore income
 was conveniently adjusted to the Muslim calendar just as houses and
 apartments were often rented beginning Mu}:iarram. 157
More outspoken than the documents are the legal queries submitted
 to Moses Maimonides and to his son and successor Abraham (in the
 years 1170-1237, approximately). "A judge administering capital be-
 longing to orphans used to lend it to Jews against interest. When he
 grants a loan of 100 dinars, he writes '110 for the duration of one
 year,' ... or he sells objects for 100 dinars and buys them back later
 for 90." The rate is approximately the same as the one in the record
 book from the year 1156 (above, p. 254). Abraham, to whom this query
 was addressed, suggests in his habitual kindness that the facts were
 perhaps incorrectly reported. Since anyone dealing with the property of
 orphans had to stand security for the capital invested, the observer
 mistook the profit for fixed interest stipulated in advance. In his very
 detailed responsum, the Nagid surveys the various types of interest
 discussed by the lawyers and concludes that taking concealed interest
 was punishable even more than fixed interest, because the latter, being
 such an outright sin, was practiced less than the former. 158 The most







 common form of concealed interes~"the one approved by the most
 noble minds"-we read in a letter to Moses Maimonides, was deferment
 of payment at a higher than the real price, a procedure strictly forbid-
 den by the master.! 59 An outrageous example of this practice, also sub-
 mitted to him, was the "sale" of three pieces of clothing worth 39
 dirhems, valued in a l)ujj a as costing 60.160 The following passage
 from a letter to I;Ialf on Dimyati, the renowned India traveler, by his
 brother Eli, seems to presuppose the same usage: "I went to Minyat
 Ashna and took from the two illustrious elders [here follow the names
 of two Jewish notables] a sum amounting to 85 dinars, on which I
 'advanced' to them 27 dinars, while the balance remained with me as
 debt. I acted thus in order to have plenty of goods and cash at my dis-
 posal. Repayment on Passover." The letter was written only two months
 before that term. 161
Maimonides' responsa also reveal the importance acquired by loans
 for overseas trade. A merchant on his way from Egypt to Tunis, which
 had taken the place of al-Mahdiyya as the main port of Tunisia, had
 received loans, salaf, from eight different persons.162 This is reminiscent
 of the Roman "sea loan." One document, in which an Italian Jew, Ser
 Misha'el of Trapani, gives a loan of 10 ounces of Diiqi, that is, Norman,
 gold of Messina, to an Egyptian Jew traveling to Sicily, provides the
 Arabic term for the operation, namely bi-rizq al-ba~r, "for business
 overseas." It also contains the condition, known from Byzantium, that
 the loan has to be paid back within one month after the arrival of the
 ship in which the debtor and his goods were carried. Thus, it seems not
 excluded that in this process of the replacement of partnerships by loans
 European influence was at work in the Islamic overseas trade.1 63
Fixed interest, called thus both by its Arabie and Hebrew names
 ribii, ribb'ith, appears first in a legal document from Bilbays, 1239. It
amounted to 20 dirhems per month with regard to a debt of 36 dinars,
an annual rate of 16-% percent. The interest was stipulated before a
Muslim notary and the document referred to was concerned with a
side issue, but, in an earlier period, no judge would have taken action
connected with a contract based on outright interest.164 The term rihbith
occurs again in a fragmentary letter from late Mamluk times.1· 05 In view
of such scanty evidence it is safe to assume that within the community
appearances were kept up and outright stipulation of interest was
avoided. Very illuminating in this respect is a strongly worded letter
directed against a wandering preacher who had accused the women of a
city, among other graver things, of ]ending money against interest. The
implication was, or course, that women were ignorant of the law and
that those in authority ought to teach them better. This and other
allegations are indignantly rejected as slander. 166
 Taking loans on interest from Muslims and vice versa was regarded
as legal. During the eleventh century we read expressly only of interest
paid by Jews to Muslims and this not for commercial loans, but for







debts incurred out of sheer want. The Jewish population of Jerusalem,
which had become decimated during the terrible wars of the 1020's,
always had to borrow money on interest in order to pay the poll tax
that was imposed on it in a lump sum. 167 In one letter signed by ten
residents of the Holy City and sent to Old Cairo around 1040 it is
stated: "In the current year we took a loan of 40 dinars for the poll
tax alone from the usurer known to you." 168 That Muslim moneylender
could hardly have become fat through the impoverished Jewish pop-
ulation of Jerusalem. But those were the years when the Christian
pilgrimages gained momentum, which certainly could mean good busi-
ness for a local moneylender. When the Jewish Academy of Jerusalem
moved to Damascus we read again of heavy indebtedness. A notable in
Fustat who had pledged a donation for the academy is urged to send
his contribution immediately; otherwise, the whole sum would go for
the payment of interest alone. 169
 Cases of indebtedness of individual Jews to Muslims naturally are
reflected in Geniza papers only under specific circumstances. A Jew
from Alexandria, fleeing from his Muslim creditors, asks a social service
officer in Fustat for help, first for mere sustenance and then for a start
in the payment of his debts (around 1130). A clothier who had stood
bail for an oil merchant who had taken a loan of 20 dinars from a
Muslim and not paid it during four years receives from a Jewish court
permission to sell at auction a pair of golden bracelets deposited with
him by the debtor (around 1145) .110 We have read (above, p. 199)
Maimonides' ruling that interest ultimately accruing to a Muslim was
legally valid.
 Loans on interest granted by Jews to Muslims and Christians are
not very conspicuous in the Geniza papers. A document from the be-
ginning of the thirteenth century clearly indicates that, at that time,
such loans were a regular feature of the banking business. For although
interest is no~ expressly mentioned, the very fact that all debtors were
either Muslims or Christians is evidence enough that interest was taken.
The same must have been true for the eleventh century as is proved by
a report on the sale of valuable pawns deposited by Muslims with a
Jewish banker.171 An analysis of the account of a money changer from
the same period induced us to assume that loans of one or several dinars
to Gentile customers brought profits that could be regarded as con-
cealed interest.112 It is possible that a similar procedure was adopted
for loans in kind, such as grain. An ancient list enumerates certain
quantities of wheat (1-11 waybas, 2-3 irdabbs, also 2 irdabbs of bar-
ley) given to twenty-seven different persons, most or all of whom seem
to have been Muslims. Seven of these were women, and in three cases
other persons furnished guarantees.178 "Loans of grain" were mentioned
above (p. 117) as granted in Jerusalem. In that case, the borrower was
a Jew who undertook to repay a quantity worth 3-1/2 dinars for one
quantity the price of which was 2-%. It stands to reason that just as







Muslim moneylenders had their Jewish clientele, the opposite also
existed, although the Jewish creditor was at a disadvantage, since the
government would not act for him as promptly as for a Muslim. Any-
how, all this cannot have amounted to very much, seeing that money-
lending to Gentiles has found hardly any mention in the mass of private
and business letters, court records, and accounts preserved in the Geniza.
Instructive in this respect is also a comparison of the responsa and
other legalistic literatures of the medieval rabbis of France and Ger-
many with those of their Near Eastern predecessors and partial con-
temporaries, the Gaons and Moses and Abraham Maimonides. While
the legal and moral questions created through usurious lending to
Gentiles occupy enormous space in the works of the former they play
no role in the writings of the latter.m
 All in all, it seems that in the period and countries considered, loans
and deferred payments functioned not so much as levers of a growing
economy, but rather were indicative of the perennial lack of capital
as well as of bad business practices. Short-term loans were common. In
Kislev (Nov.-Dec.), 1140-the day is not stated-a banker grants a
loan of 14 dinars to be repaid "on the first of the coming month" and
for this a large document is made out, which states, by the way, that
the banker owed money to the debtor for a certain quantity of wine.1711
A term of three months was stipulated for a sum of 10 dinars in April,
1107, and one of three and a half months ("till Passover") for 32 dinars
in December, 1126, with the qualification that they were to be paid "in
one currency and [ coins of] one weight." 1711
 The Geniza people had no need of Balzac to learn the art of not
paying one's debts. Repeatedly, mention has been made in this book of
the pernicious habits of procrastination and delay of payment.177 The
more important a person was the more difficult it was to enforce pay-
ment. i.'vl editerranean People contains a letter in which a notable is first
congratulated on an approaching holiday on which his debt was due
and then is asked in the most deferential terms to pay since the sum
was owed to a third person and the writer had no other assets. Other-
wise he would never have had the impudence of asking for payment.178
Defaults are often described as gravely harming the creditor's business
operations. The following passage from a letter from Tunisia suffices to
illustrate: "My brother and lord, you know how much master Abii. Isb,aq
Abraham b. Burayk loves you-may God preserve him for all of us. He
asked me to write to you with regard to your debts to him, may God
preserve you. You know, my brother and lord, that he most urgently
wants to travel to Spain and nothing keeps him here in Qayrawan ex-
cept what you still owe him. So please, my brother and lord, act in ac-
cordance with the excellence of your noble character and send him what
you owe him, either overland or by sea. This is absolutely imperative.
I need not urge you more in this matter." 1711 In another letter, a mer-
chant, on the eve o.f his departure from Qayrawan, entreats his business







 correspondent in Fustat to continue collecting the sums owed him. He
 was going to stay in Spain for a long time and hoped that "until we
 will be united again, God will have collected that money through you."
 Obviously, a miracle of heavenly intervention was needed to make
 people pay.180
In view of this situation, creditors sought to protect themselves
 through collaterals, which are referred to in the Geniza papers with
 unusual frequency. Everything could serve as collateral: gold and silver
 vessels, jewelry, clothing of all description, for poorer people even bed-
 ding and household goods, books, very common, but, above all, houses,
 that is, the property titles and transfer deeds were mortgaged. In ex-
 treme cases, children were pledged. Such an occurrence in Ascalon,
 Palestine, during its occupation by the Crusaders (1153-1187), should
 not be taken as specific to Frankish law or custom,181 because similar
 cases are reported for Tunisia in the 1080's and even for Egypt slightly
 later. A widow writing from al-Mahdiyya to her brother at the time of
 the Norman invasions exculpates herself for giving away her little
 daughter as a pledge by the remark that in those dire days even free
 persons were sold as slaves.182 In an appeal to a congregation in Fustat,
 a blind woman recounts that she had to pay a Muslim physician who
 treated her daughter for dropsy 4 dinars, for which sum she had
 pledged her other children. How many is not said. I suppose, it was
 one.1ss
The value of the collateral usually exceeded by far the amount of the
 credit granted. A house was mortgaged for a loan of 10 dinars in 1135,
 half a house for 15 dinars lent for two months in 1156, two thirds of
 two shops with upper apartments for 500 dirhems in 1220.184 A complete
 Bible codex, the average price of which was 20 dinars, was pawned for a
 loan of 6 dinars in 1027, two treatises of the Talmud for 20 dirhems
 around 1220, seven pieces of precious clothing for 4 dinars in 1213,
 and so on.185 A merchant who had pledged four books for a debt of 5-¼
 dinars resulting from a deal in indigo writes from a journey to his
 creditor to sell the books and to return the balance to his son; obviously,
 he was sure that the books would obtain a far higher price than the
 amount owed by him (1178) .186 All the assets in the will of a female
 broker, which amounted to the considerable sum of 322 dinars were,
 with the exception of 80 dinars lent to a friend, covered by "securities
 and pawns" deposited with her.187 Several Geniza records permit the
 creditor to sell the objects confided to him. 188 In one banker's account
 we see in fac~ that pawns of very high value were used in this way.1 89
Another means to secure payment was the severe punishment, in-
 cluding long imprisonment and torture, meted out to tardy debtors,
 when brought before a Muslim court. 190 J'he Jewish court had no power
 for such measures, but also took a strong stand and, in extreme cases,
 went so far as to excommunicate a member evading his obligations,m
 or to reserve themselves the right to "extradite" him to the Muslim







 authorities.1112 In view of the seriousness and delicacy of such alterna-
 tives, the head of the Jewish community in Egypt used to attend to
 cases of insolvent debtors in person, and various documents to this
 effect have been preserved. 193 An autograph letter by the Gaon Ma~lial}
 (Head, 1127-1139) strongly advises the head of the Jewish congregation
 in Malij to arrange for the settlement of a debt due in that place "so
 that the complainant should not need to appeal again" (namely to the
 Gaon) .1114 In a most elaborate document from January, 1133, a debt
 resulting from a partnership and subsequently from business done
 after the death of one of the partners with the latter's son is settled
 before Ma~lial} in person and he validates in his own hand the testimony
 in a later session. The settlement was reached through the intervention
 of "upright and pious elders" and stipulated that payment was to be
 made in forty installments of 1 dinar per month over a period of three
 and a quarter years.195 -

 Repayment in installments is so prominent in our sources that it
 needs to be considered in some detail. Monthly installments of 1 dinar
 must have been popular, since, besides the case just mentioned, six
 others have been noted, the earliest being a Karaite document of re-
 lease from November, 1030. The sums concerned range from 11 to 47
 dinars, the larger found in an inventory written during the years 1162-
 1164. That entry is noteworthy on two counts. The writer states that
 the agreement on installments of 1 dinar was made in a Muslim l_mjja,
 but still the debtor had not paid a penny. We see that such settlements,
 which are so common in Jewish records, were also made before Muslim
authorities, and that in case of default the creditor was reluctant to
 take recourse to the law.196
 Government itself consented to receive in installments the debts due
it. When two tax-farmers, father and son, were unable to meet their
obligations and another took over from them, he was allowed to pay
their debt of 80 dinars in four years, albeit the yearly sum to be ad-
 vanced by him to the government in respect of the revenue to be col-
lected by him was as much as 335 dinars (July-Aug., 1147) .117 Repay-
ment distributed over four years is foreseen also in a rather complicated
settlement from spring, 1092. A debtor promises to pay 40 out of 101
dinars on the forthcoming Passover holiday which fell a week after
the signature of the document. The balance of 61 dinars was to be paid
in 48 monthly installments by 'Ulla b. Joseph, a prominent merchant
and communal officer, and in case he moved to another city, by another
notable. How these two gentlemen would be compensated by the debtor
certainly was stated in another record. In any case, this agreement weU
illustrates how the merchants assisted their faltering companions:1•
When the maker of purple cloth 'Ariis b. Joseph, who was renowned
for his generosity, granted a loan of 11 dinars to a person from Ramie,
Palestine, to be returned in 66 monthly installments of ¼ dinar during







five and a half years, we may assume that he wanted to help the man,
presumably a refugee from the Seljuks, to develop a small business
or workshop (May, 1088) .199 Of a similar purpose were perhaps loans
of 5 and 10 dinars, respectively, to be repaid in monthly installments
of ½ and ½ dinar (Oct.: 1090, and summer, 1156) .200 When, however,
we read in a letter from Alexandria, written around 1080, that a loan or
debt of 106 dinars was to be repaid in weekly rates of 10 dinars, and
that the addressee in Fustat was asked to collect one installment due,
the tenor of the letter shows that the arrangement was entirely business-
like, and that no difficulties were expected over the collection.201
 In a petition to a Fatimid vizier, a Muslim baker, hard pressed by
a creditor, humbly asks to be permitted to repay his debt in installments,
taqsif, "so that he may be enabled to remain in his native city, to
support his family and to regain a new lease on life." Upon the order
of the vizier, "the secretary of the fine pen" and then, with some en-
largements, "the secretary of the thick pen" instruct the qadi to in-
vestigate the petitioner's circumstances and to look into his case in
accordance with the exigencies of the religious law and public welfare.
The document, which came into the Geniza perhaps because the poor
baker sought help from a Jewish friend, shows that even the highest
authorities were troubled with requests for payments of debts in in-
stallments. The unusually large number of documents dealing with this
matter found in the Geniza is to be explained in the light of this fact. 202
 The reverse side of bills of debt sometimes reveals how payment in
installments actually worked. A glaring example of discrepancies be-
tween conditions stipulated and those fulfilled is provided in Appendix
C, section 12 (1143). A document almost contemporary with the latter
provides a different picture. A communal official had taken a loan of 11
dinars for the community to be returned in 11 monthly installments.
The back of the leaf contains the following three entries: "Received
from Salim, the beadle who farmed the revenue from the communal
houses-three dinars out of the sum due. Acknowledged by the above-
mentioned creditor. Valid." "Received two dinars exactly, out of that
sum." "Also received six dinars. Nothing due any more from this bill."
Here, but on1y here, there follow date (exactly twelve months after the
loan was granted, 1146) and place (Fustat) and the signatures of the
judge and two assessors. 203 In 1265, a banker gives a loan of 377 ex-
cellent nuqra silver dirhems to the proprietor of a sugar factory, to be
paid back in weekly installments of 25 pieces. The reverse side contains
two entries. One, written and signed by David, the grandson of Moses
Maimonides, acknowledges a payment of 50 nuqra, which is followed
by a declaration of the banker that he transfers the remaining debt of
327 dirhems to his wife. A second entry notes a payment of 75 dir-
hems.204 Should we infer from such occurrences that the stipulation of
weekly or monthly installments was taken with a grain of salt by both







 sides? Thus far, we have never happened to find on the back of a
 document a full list of payments, arranged according to weeks or
 months, as stipulated on its front.

Before leaving this vast subject of credit it seems appropriate to
 summarize its main features:
 1. Sale on credit was the normal business procedure. It is treated
 in our section on commerce, pages 197-200, above.
 2. Loans often were nothing but an extension of the usually deferred
 payment.
 3. Borrowing relatively small, but not always quite so small,
 amounts from friends, even from members of another faith, was com-
 monplace.
 4. Merchants and craftsmen assisted each other with substantial
 loans, for which, as far as the evidence of the eleventh-century docu-
 ments goes, no interest was taken. It was also a customary form of
 charity to grant loans large enough for conducting 1. small business
 or workshop through a number of years.
 5. Muslims lent Jews money on fixed interest during the eleventh
 century. In all documents preserved, the money was borrowed not for
 business purposes, but because of sheer want.
 6. During the same period, and also later, Jewish bankers gave
 secured and unsecured loans to Muslims. It stands to reason that they,
 too, charged interest, although this is not expressly stated. Concealed
 interest was assumed in the cases of small amounts of money or
 of wheat and barley regularly lent to customers.
 7. Deposits with bankers, as is proved by the paramount economic
 importance of bankers notes, must have been frequent. But they were
 short-term, and there is no indication of interest granted by the banker
 or of a compensatior1 paid to him for his services. .
 8. Concealed and even outright interest for regular commercial loans
 make their appearance around the middle of the twelfth century. Loans
 begin to replace commendas and partnerships in the overseas trade.
 The "sea loan" was perhaps taken over from Europe.
 9. Collateral was varied, and more often than not repayment in
 installments, sometimes extending to periods of six years, was stipu-
 lated. Some such stipulations probably contained an element of con-
 cealed interest, especially in later times. On the other hand, in many
 cases, the wording of the documents concerned indicates that payment
 in installments was granted because the debtor otherwise would have
 been unable to meet his obligations.
10. Declarations of debt were negotiable, for which reason it was
 preferable to have them made out by a Muslim, that is, state, authority.
 In addition to the Muslim document, loans were often also certified by
 a Jewish court, and, in many cases, even solely by it, which underlines
 their basic character of mutual help and even charity.







 Investment and hoarding.-Our study of the Geniza documents re-
lated to industry, agriculture, commerce, and banking, has shown how
the people of that period put their money to work. In the following
we try to integrate this knowledge with the aid of inventories drawn
up on various occasions, particularly those accompanying a will or the
settlement of an estate. By their very nature, such inventories tend to
include all or most of the possessions of the person concerned.
 Two principles of sound finance were evident throughout the pre-
ceding chapters: one should never le~ one's money idle, but invest it in
profitable undertakings, and secondly, one should spread the risk and
participate in a great many ventures of limited scope. The inven-
tories show that, on the one hand, these principles were closely followed,
and, on the other, utterly disregarded, or rather offset by other, op-
posing principles.
 A merchant, returning, it seems, from overseas and embarking on
another prolonged journey, lists twenty-seven assets totaling about
460 dinars regarding which action had to be taken. At the end of the
long statement he remarks: "Other debts are due me from both Jews
and Muslims, some of which are certified by a notary and some are not.
They are noted in my account book." This concluding remark obviously
refers to items the collection of which was not expected to encounter
difficulties. The assets were rents of houses, stores, and a workshop in
two different towns, while the family house, of which half belonged to
the writer, was in a third town; also loans, especially those given to tax-
farmers who had to advance money to the government, balances from
commercial ventures, and income from a partnership in a sugar mill.
Thus, this list is a perfect illustration of the two principles of sound
iinance referred to above (1165) .205 The same holds true for the estate
of a substantial tax-farmer despite the fact that only the concluding
three columns have been preserved. Fifteen loans, mostly granted in
round sums such as 50, 100, 150, or 200 dinars, amounted to about
1,240 dinars, while ten purses of cash totaled less than 140. Some of
these purses contained currencies of a specific type, for example, 10
Ibrahimiyya dinars (of the Almoravid crown prince Ibrahim b.
Tashfin, coined in the years 1144-1145 206) or 1,800 "fresh" dirhems,
or a paper bag with 5-½ dinars of "broken gold," fragments of dinars.
A third group of possessions was nine pieces of gold and silver jewelry,
amounting, according to the price known to us from other sources, to
60-80 dinars. Additional pieces of jewelry are listed as pawns for
loans. Only smaller loans, such as one of 18-¾ dinars (in weight, pre-
sumably presenting 20 coins in number) were covered by such a means
of security. AU in all we see that this farmer of the taxes on the weaving
and dyeing of silk, who at his death owed the government 125 dinars,
did not let his money idle. Besides his main occupation, he invested in
a great number of diversified loans. There is only one very large item
among them, one of 440 dinars, entrusted to the banker Ibn Sunaynit







(seep. 251, above) .207 A statement accompanying a will and comprising
 eleven assets of a total value of 204-¾ dinars and 140 dirhems may
 reflect a similar tendency of diversified investment, but the will belong-
 ing to this statement has not yet been found. 208
A somewhat different picture emerges from an inventory drawn up
 by a merchant in a document in which he appointed his infant daughter
 as his sole heir. He enumerates seventeen assets amounting to about
 350 dinars, among them a number of astonishingly small shares in
 partnerships for business trips to Yemen. In conclusion, however, he
mentions in addition having invested 300 dinars in a partnership with
 a banker who had become insolvent. In this ease the principle of spread-
 ing the risk was not observed, possibly because banking once had been
 the writer's main occupation (around 1100) .209 Similarly, an estate con-
sisting of 1,937 jars of wine (worth about 200-300 dinars), 48 pieces of
 gold, and a slave girl worth 19 dinars betrays a man who derived his
livelihood from the production and sale of that beverage (1150 or
shortly thereafter) .210 It is also l}atural that craftsmen should invest
all their modest means in materials for their work. The rather detailed
will of a silk-weaver, the father of four sons, shows indeed that besides
half a house and his instruments, which seem to have been valuable,
all his assets consisted in raw materials and half-finished products. To
be sure, silk in those days was almost like cash (Dec., 1188) .2 u
Still other considerations seem to have prevailed in the counsels
leading to the following documents. A man on his deathbed declares
that he owes the large sum of 238 dinars to a banker. This obligation
should be met by the sale of a quantity of sugar stored with the pro-
prietor of a sugar mill while the balance of the sale's proceeds should be
paid to the testator's son. The banker and the industrialist were en-
trusted jointly with the execution of the sale. Investment in sugar, as
has often been stated here, had become popular and fashionable in the
thirteenth century. Remarkable about this deathbed declaration is the
unusually large quantity of one commodity turned over to a single busi-
ness friend (Nov., 1203).212 Similar is the case of the rich goldsmith
whose estate of August, 1114, shows that almost all his asset.s, over a
thousand dinars, were kept in one bank (father and son).213 There must
have been compelling reasons for this deviation from the principle of
spreading the risk, perhaps old age, which made the laborious task of
supervision too burdensome.
There is another most remarkable trait in this inventory of the rich
goldsmith. We know from literary sources that the Muslim rulers used
to hoard huge quantities of gold and silver coins. It was customary
to note in the obituary of a caliph or sultan how much cash he left in
the treasury at his death.m It stands to reason that in this, as in
other matters, the subjects followed the example of their rulers. Our
document is a point in case. Besides jewelry and some bars of silver
and gold, which were probably needed in the goldsmith's workshop,







 he left 400 (less½!) "fresh" dinars and "a second cash sum" of 54-¼
 "old" dinars, which represented a very considerable fraction of his
 fortune. With this, compare the will of a female broker, made around
 I 100. Out of a total of assets of 689 dinars, there was 300 gold pieces
 "in cash presently with me" (again a round sum!), in addition to 67
 dinars deposited with another lady. Besides, there was other, not
 specified, cash in the house. 215 Thus we see that certain people, especially
 those who were near death either because of old age or poor health,
 well-to-do people, of course, preferred to hoard hard cash in quantities
 representing a very substantial part of their wealth. By its very nature
 this economic attitude required utmost secrecy. Otherwise, we would
 certainly have learned more about it from the Geniza. Coins used to
 be buried. A Geniza document recounts the story of a particular type
 of dinars excavated near the Qubba mosque in the Fortress of the
 Greeks in Fustat, a Jewish neighborhood. 216 When the ramparts of the
 Alhambra of Granada, Spain, were constructed, a jug containing 3,000
 mithqals was unearthed at the former location of the house of a Jew
 who had served as a treasurer to a ruler of that city.211 Future students
 of the Geniza should be advised however, that the cash sums so fre-
 quently appearing in settlements for orphans mostly do not represent
 the actual estate left to them. Rather it was the policy of the Jewish
 courts to realize all the assets of the deceased and to sell his inventory
 immediately after his demise, entrusting the proceeds to a reliable and
 financially strong "trustee."
In times of insecurity and political unrest even commercial cash
 receipts were confided to the earth. In a letter written in Qayrawan
 on August 9, 1052, a merchant informs his brother in Alexandria that
 the payments for the Egyptian flax sent by the addressee were collected
 only with greatest difficulty, and then, he adds in Hebrew, "I hid them
 in the earth." He knew that his brother would be dissatisfied with
 letting his capital idle. Therefore he adds: "I prefer being censured by
 you while your money is safe to being censured while your money is
 lost." 21s
The ability to supervise one's investments certainly played an impor-
 tant part in the choice of the type of investment preferred. Wherever
 we have the possibility to check we find that persons invested in farm-
 land and husbandry when they had some connection with the country,
 for example, as tax-farmers or government officials, or as relatives of
 such persons. Thus, the son of an immigrant from Baghdad referred to
 above (p. 117) as a landowner was an assistant director of finance in
 a rural district, and the scribe from Old Cairo who also owned land was
 his brother-in-law. A similar relationship existed between two cousins,
 immigrants from Palestine (cf. ibid.). The family described there as
 possessing flocks of sheep and agricultural land acted as farmers of
 the taxes on fruit trees. 2 L9 Very rich people could allow themselves the
 luxury of the role of absentee landlords since their possessions and







 undertakings were so manifold that they had partly to be managed by
 agents.
The majority of the Geniza people lived in cities or provincial
 towns. Urban property could therefore be conveniently supervised by
 them and consequently represented a most popular form of investment.
 The extremely rich Geniza material on the subject is discussed in a
 separate subsection. 220 Seemingly, the principle of diversified invest-
 ment was paramount in this field too, since we see that people, in
 addition to, or instead of, possessing one house, often had larger or
 smaller shares in a number of other houses. This, however, was due
 mainly to the splitting up of estates through the continuous process of
 inheritance. Complete houses simply were rare to come by. Although
 living in rented apartments was by no means uncommon, even poor
 people usually possessed a house or part of one. As we have noted,
 houses were mortgaged. Without such collateral one could hardly
 hope for a more substantial loan.
A similar function was fulfilled by jewelry and durable clothing
 and bedding, to which books, both sacred and secular, have to be
 added. Many Geniza papers show that such objects often were heir-
 looms transmitted from one generation to another. Together with
 houses and household goods they formed the dowry of a daughter or
 sister, put aside or collected years in advance of their prospective
 marriage. Houses· and other durable possessions given by her family,
 together with the cash presented by the husband's marriage gift, safe-
 guarded the economic independence of the married woman and provided
 for her old age in case of widowhood or divorce. The care of the
 family's women certainly was one of the main reasons for the accumula-
 tion of capital.
Practically every letter and legal document from the Geniza has
 some relevance to the question of how people tried to preserve and
 augment their possessions. Full justice can be done to it, therefore,
 only at a far more advanced stage of research. At that time, it will
 also be rewarding to compare the tendencies apparent in the Geniza
 material with the economic theories expounded in Islamic literature,
 as well as with those in the Talmud and later Jewish sources, and with
 those prevailing in popular Middle Eastern tradition, all three of which
 were influenced to a certain degree by Greek philosophical speculations.
 Still, even our preliminary study has revealed, in addition to some
 basic traits, quite a variety of attitudes and practices of economic
 behavior, which is indicative of the mobile and individualistic character
 of the Geniza society.


 G. GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF COMMERCE
How far did the Fatimid and Ayyubid governments of Egypt and
Syria and other governments referred to in the Geniza documents







influence the commercial activities going on in their respective coun-
tries? To what extent are indications of supervision, guidance, protec-
tion, interference, or oppression discernible in our sources? The answer
is that most of these elements were present, but, as a whole, within
reasonable limits. There were ups and downs, there were differences
among various countries, even cities, and between individual rulers
and governments. But in general we do not find that people expect to
receive directives or help from their governments, except for legal
protection and defense against enemies and pirates, nor are there many
complaints about excessive taxation or direct wrongs. Still, the presence
of the government was very much felt.
 First, both as producer and consumer, the government was the
greatest customer in the country. Agricultural products were largely
bought from or through government agencies. This applies in partic-
ular to flax, the main export staple of Egypt in that period. Before
setting out to one of the centers of flax-growing, the merchants had to
provide themselves with letters of introduction to the local 'ii.mil, or
director of finance. Upon arrival they advanced money to the diwin,
 or government office, of the district. The final accounts for the purchase
 were settled with the central bureau in Cairo.1
 Money was not "issued" by the government, but bought or rather
 ordered from it. A "supplier," called murid, delivered quantities of
 gold or silver in a variety of fonns (bars, vessels, old coins, or their
 fragments) to the mint and received the equivalent in currency after
 the deduction of a charge for the government and remuneration for
 the workers. These mu.rids appear, especially in the early Ayyubid
 period, as the richest people at the head of the lists of donators to
 communal appeals. 2
Because of the incomplete state of many of our documents we are
 not always in a position to know which commodity was handled by
 the diwan referred to. In a moving complaint, submitted by an Alex-
 andrian Jew to a Muslim judge in a provincial town, he describes how
 he had purchased from a diwan five qintars of a certain article, be-
 cause he was overwhelmed by homesickness and hoped to find a liveli-
 hood with these goods in his native city; however, after having brought
 them safely to the cara vanserai, officials appeared and forced him to
 sell them back to the government; he now asks the judge to compel the
 diwan to deliver the goods, while he was prepared to pay the latter an
 indemnity of 3 dinars. 8
As consumer the government is even more in evidence in the Geniza
 papers. When the prices for silk in Fustat were desperately low, a
 merchant sold his stock to the government and received payment (as
 is expressly stated).' When a qintar of soap reached an exorbitant
 price in Tunisia, the writer who reports this matter adds: "Only the
 government can permit itself to buy at such a price." 1 Similarly, when
 in Alexandria a qintir of pepper cost 40 dinars, we read: "At such a
 price one can sell only to a government."•







In the same letter, another aspect of the (Fatimid) government's
 economic policy is apparent-its prerogative to take possession of
 commodities against the wish of the merchant.a carrying them. "The
 other item [which, is not stated; a reference is made to the addressee's
 letter] was taken by the governmental wardrobe, may God make
 permanent his [the ruler's] reign, and, thus far, no payment has been
 made. 11 7 This letter was written around 1120. In a letter to Alexandria,
 sent about seventy years earlier: "I learn from the correspondence of
 the merchants brought by the mail courier that the mastic that had
 been sequestered is now being sold freely. I hope, you have bought
 some." (Mastic, also called "Greek chewing gum," because it used to
 be obtained from a tree growing in particular on the Greek island of ·
 Chios, was a great article of import to Egypt.) In August, 1140, we
 read, again from Alexandria: "All silk that arrived was detained for
 the government with the exception of that of poor quality or small
 quantities." As in Byzantium, "silks of poorer quality were less re-
 stricted" by control.8 The seizure of lead and wax, reported above, page
 60, also occurred in Alexandria, which is known from literature as
 seat of a matjar, or government supply center, though more so for a
 later period.9 The same practices existed elsewhere. In several letters
 from Tunisia, written around the middle of the eleventh century, we
 read that olive oil was "detained" or "seized" by the government.10
 Precious consignments of textiles destined for Qayrawan were opened
 and thoroughly examined in al-Mahdiyya, being passed on only if
 the official in charge decided not to purchase them for the government
(early eleventh century).11 The tenor of the letter reporting this occur-
 rence clearly shows, however, that the writer would have welcomed
 selling his m~rchandise to the government, and tl_ie relatively rare
 occurrence of references to the forceful seizure of goods by the govern-
 ment agencies seems to indicate that these practices were not particu-
 larly oppressive.
Occasionally, we read about the wholesale "sequestration" of a
 merchant's consignment or of the "confiscation" of three ships in a
 row with all their cargoes, both reported with regard to al-Mahdiyya.u
 Since no details are provided, we are left in the dark as to the nature
 of such acts. In the first case, occurring in 1130, a local merchant might
 have had a claim against the traveler, wherefore the government seized
 his goods. This was common practice, adhered to also by the Jewish
 courts, so that often one cannot be sure whether a governmntal or com-
 munal authority is referred to, as when a letter from a notable in
Ascalon; Palestine, addressed to a business friend in Tyre, Lebanon,
contains the passage: "The elder so-and-so produced documents and
oral evidence against you, which had the effect that your consignments
destined for the West were detained here." 11 The seizure of the ships,
which belonged to three different proprietors, must have occurred.
around 1050, which would lead one to assume that this was a political







 action perpetrated by the Zirid ruler of Tunisia who had broken with
 his Fatimid overlord in 1048. In the same letter, however, we see a
 number of other ships arriving safely in Alexandria from al-Mahdiyya,
 and the merchants mentioned as having lost their consignments were
 themselves Tunisians, though residing at that time, at least partly, in
 Egypt.14
 Direct help extended by a government agency to a merchant is
 mentioned only rarely. In the winter of 1140-1141, a prominent India
 trader advises his representative in the East African port of 'Aydhii.b
 to buy a certain Oriental product-and in case he was without cash
 to take a loan from the diwan, or local government office. The writer,
 who at that time stayed in Fustat, seemed to assume that such loans
 were granted without much ado. 15 When in the letter to the Fayyiim
 quoted above, page 240, a person is warned not to do any business
 with the diwan, a warning illustrated by examples of people who had
 suffered physical torture as a result of such dealings in Fustat, a
 similar relationship, namely money taken from the government, might
 have been involved.16 A petition submitted to the vizier Ibn al-Sallar
 in December, 1150, asserts that a defunct merchant whose house and
 workshop had been sequestered by the police never had business rela-
 tions with the diwan, nor had ever served as a tax-farmer.11 Thus, the
 warning expressed in the Fayyiim letter seems to have been not without
foundation.
 All in all, the situation in the Islamic countries of the Mediterranean
 seems not to have differed much from that in the Byzantine empire
about which Steven Runciman has this to say: "Byzantine foreign
 trade . . . received very little encouragement from the imperial au-
thorities whose interference in it was only concerned with questions
of revenue and the acquisition of raw materials needed by the imperial
factories." The action of the caliph al-Mustan~ir, who instructed his
vizier to bring people with capital from Syria to Egypt, which was im-
poverished after years of famine (around 1075), or that of the vizier
al-Ma'miin, who ordered the establishment in Cairo of a dii.r wakii.la
for the merchants arriving from Iraq and Syria (1122---1123) show that
the Fatimid government was not entirely without initiative in matters
of commerce. Reports about such steps, however, are rare.18
 Customs dues excepted, the Geniza papers do not say much about
taxes imposed on business. We mostly learn about them indirectly,
namely through references to tax-farmers who collected these payments
:for the government. Each store had to have a license, for which monthly
dues had to be paid. This applied not only to workshops, as might be
concluded from our literary sources, but also shops for the sale of
foodstuffs and other commodities. These dues were collected according
to the months of the Muslim year, not those of the financial year which
was geared to the agricultural seasons. This fact, however, should not
induce us to assume-as has been done-that these were rents for







 government-owned premises. The store licenses had to be adapted to
 the months of the Muslim year because stores, like houses and apart-
 ments, were leased for such periods.111 In a late Geniza document from
 the Mamluk period this tax is called l}isba, or payment to the mul}tasib,
 the superintendent of the market, and it forms an important item in a
 contract of partnership in a store for the production and sale of cheese.20
 As we know from o~her sources, the l)isba had become a heavy burden
 by that time. No .such complaints with regard to the Fatimid and
 Ayyubid periods have been found thus far. This office of the mul)tasib,
 which in Egypt became prominent only by the end of the twelfth
 century, is discussed in Mediterranean Society, Volume II, chapter vii,
 section C.
The system of licensing, in addition to being a source of revenue,
 enabled the government to supervise the commercial and industrial
 activities of its subjects. At the conclusion of a partnership it had to
 be stipulated unequivocally who would be the responsible manager
 "whose name was registered with the tax-farmers." 21 From the con-
 ditions of such contracts we have concluded that a partner holding a
 license was in an advantageous position as opposed to the person
 joining the business or the workshop.22
In a famous passage of his Khitat, al-Maqrizi enumerates eighty-
 eight noncanonical dues and taxes levied by the Fatimids and abolished
 by Saladin when he assumed power in Egypt. The total revenue from
 these mukus, collected in the twin cities of Cairo and Fustat, amounted
 to 100,000 dinars per year. Saladin's action was by no means excep-
 tional. The caliph al-I;Iakim (996-1021) had made the same pious
 gesture before, and the ostentatious abolition of taxes not recognized by
 Islamic religious law became a standard practice for rulers on ascend-
 ing the throne. 23
Maqrizi's list is instructive inasmuch as it indicates that the Fatimid
 tax system tried to adapt itself to a diversified and largely urban
 economy, although the main burden still was borne by the farmland. A
 number of points in this list could be illustrated from the Geniza
 documents. The main items were tolls collected from almost anything
 entering or leaving the twin cities. This subject is treated in the section
 on customs. It is not always possible to distinguish between these tolls
and the purchase tax, since both were called, among other names,
 wiijib, "dues." Concerning slaves we know positively that "market
 dues" were paid at their sale.:u The same applied to transport animals.
 In one letter it was 2 dirhems per donkey and 4 per camel. Prices for
 donkeys fluctuated in the Geniza documents between 2 and 5 dinars,
 with 3 as an average. Thus the purchase tax would amount to about
 1-% percent. Maqr'izi reports that a camel selling for 5 dinars would
 be taxed 5 dirhems, around 2-½ percent. The writer of that letter was
 afraid, however, that the newly appointed head of the relevant govern-
 ment office would increase the tariff despite an assurance in writing







by his predecessor to the contrary.25 According to Maqrizi's list, the
market in riding animals (donkeys or mules) brought a yearly revenue
of 400 dinars. On the assumptions that the tax per head was the same
as indicated in the Geniza letter and that the average ratio between
dinar and dirhem was 1 :40, a total of 81000 animals would have changed
hands in the twin cities during a single year. Saladin's edict, as reported
by Maqrizi, does not govern the tax on the production of wine which
was abolished by him on another occasion but reinstated later, nor
does it include that on the transfer of real estate. Both impositions are
referred to in the Geniza documents, the latter in considerable detail. 26
 The expression "purchase tax/' wiijib mushtarii, has been found thus
far only with regard to al-Mahdiyya around 1100. It was 7-½ 4 local
dinars on a sale of 264-½ 4 , about 2.7 percent. The report concerned
does not comment on the rate which was probably customary at that
time and place. 27 In Alexandria a sales tax of 2 percent was regarded
as particularly heavy, as is indicated in this somewhat cryptic passage
from a letter sent from there to al-Mahdiyya around 1050: "Much was
lost from the price of the goods I sold for you in Alexandria, for every
damned dinar in Alexandria goes down the drain through a rescript of
the government. For every 50 dinars in number they asked from me
one dinar. I said to them: 'One does not make a profit of 1 dinar on 50.'
Moreover I have brought them [the dinars] with me to Alexandria. I
hope that I shall retrieve most of them for you." 28
 The concluding sentence of this passage contains an allusion that
was certainly not destined for the eyes of a government official. The
Geniza proves that there was some kind of economic censorship. The
merchants generally expected that their letters could be intercepted by
 the a~~iib al-akhbiir, the government secret service, and therefore often
referred to oral messages that were to be transmitted by business friends
traveling at the same time or on the same ship in which the letter was
sent. Articles that at certain periods H was hazardous or not permissible
 to trade, such as iron, wheat, or silver, were expressed in Hebrew. The
 writers assumed that the secret police knew the Hebrew script in which
 the letters were written, hut not the language. (They might have been
 mistaken in this respect as were the nineteenth-century cattle-dealers
 of Hesse or Bavaria, who spoke a Judaizing argot among themselves
 which some outsiders succeeded in mastering.) There is also direct
 testimony for such governmental surveillance. In a letter written around
 1100, the chief rabbi of Aleppo, Syria, asks a colleague, it seems, in
 Fustat, to send him legal documents concerning a property of orphans
 by special mail, and not, as was usual, attached to business correspond-
 ence, "for the letters of the merchants are being detained and hardly
 reach Aleppo." 29 A Tunisian merchant, writing from Sicily, reports
 around 1063: "The mailman, lbn 'Abbud, arrived, but no letter from
 you arrived with him. I was very much upset. Then he told me that
 he had carried a letter for me, but it was taken away from him in







 al-Mahdiyya." 30 Approximately at the same time we read in a letter
 from Alexandria: "The courier was on the point of leaving when he
 was detained by the governor." 31
We should not assume, however, that the government and the mer-
 chants' community formed two hostile camps. In the section on dues
 and customs we see that customs evasions were not common to an ex-
 tent greater than could reasonably be expected. And there were mani-
 festations of cooperation. The same merchant whose letter was con-
 fiscated in al-Mahdiyya and who used to commute between Sfax, his
 native Tunisian city, and Mazara, Sicily, reports, when once at home:
 "My lord, the qa'id, sent for me and dispatched me to Yaniinash to
 collect the tithes." 82 Naturally, this merchant who for many years had
 bought from the farmers their main product, olive oil, for export to
 Egypt, was well acquainted with their circumstances and was therefore
 an ideal tax collector. About twenty-five years earlier, when, owing to
 an open state of war, only the sultan's ship sailed from Tunisia to
 Egypt, the sultan permitted a prominent Jewish merchant to load his
 consignments (and those of his friends) on his ship. 33 Robes of honor
 were bestowed on merchants as on government officials and other de-
 serving notables. 84
Above all: the whole Fatimid administration was based on tax-
farming; it devolved one of the main economic tasks of the government
 on individual merchants. 35 The Geniza documents confirm Claude
 Cahen's verdict on the general economic policies of the Egyptian gov-
 ernment during the High Middle Ages: it had neither the wish, nor the
 machinery to impose strict control over a burgeoning economy.38







 CHAPTER IV


 Travel and Seafaring


1. INCENTIVES FOR TRAVEL
 Travel today is normally convenient and even pleasurable. Our
means of transportation are comfortable, fast, and safe. As a rule, the
present-day traveler need not fear pirates and robbers, or the unex-
pected seizure of his belongings by a hostile government. On journeys
that require a protracted absence from his home, he may be accom-
panied by his wife or even his whole family. When this is not feasible,
or on shorter journeys, he is able to remain in constant contact with his
loved ones through the modern methods of communication.
 The situation was much different in the times and the countries that
form the subject of this study. The means of locomotion were slow and
caused extreme discomfort. Nature's caprice and perfidy vied with the
lawlessness and rapacity of man to render any journey a hazardous
undertaking. Wives, not to speak of children, practically never accom-
panied the father of the family on his journeys, even when he was away
for years. A further hardship on travelers and their families was the
impossibility of hearing from one another over long periods of time.
 Yet, Mediterranean man in the Middle Ages was an impassioned and
persevering traveler. The factors inducing him to go on long distance
journeys have been treated on pages 42-59, above. Here it should be
added that there were also many compelling reasons for travel within
the borders of a country. Administration was concentrated in the capital
of the state or in the provincial seats of government. In order to apply
for a license, or a position, or to obtain redress in matters of taxation,
one had to betake oneself to the relevant government office and often
to more than one. The administration of justice was also highly cen-
tralized, and, because of the curious procedures adhered to in the Mus-
lim as well as in the Jewish courts of the time, a litigation, even of
comparatively small scope, used to start at the top rather than at the
bottom of the judicial ladder. All this necessitated trips to the capital,
whenever a case could not be settled by agreement. Administrative
officials and circuit judges were to be found on the roads, and so were
the physicians serving the amirs or called to patients in smaller places. 1







Commerce was another great incentive for travel. According to the
 principle that "a man who is present sees what he who is absent cannot
 see," businessmen felt themselves compelled to visit in person even
 remote centers of agricultural or industrial production. When this was
 not practicable, they would send trustworthy representatives, or induce
 some relative or business partner, to settle there temporarily or per-
 manently. In this manner, members of a family or business community
 would become widely dispersed, and their mutual visiting resulted in
 much additional traffic. Etiquette required that in cases of mourning or
 joy, such as a wedding or a circumcision celebration, relatives and
 friends should participate in person, even if ~hey lived in a distant town.
 Moreover, people seem generally to have been quite sociable. The
 Geniza has preserved many letters alluding to weekend and holiday
 visits with one's relatives or friends in both cities and villages.
We see, then, that inland trips in those days were no less frequent
 than voyages overseas, and the discomfort and the insecurity involved
 in both were insufficient to discourage travel necessary for adminis-
 trative, business, or social purposes. It is natural that the degree of
 security and ease sought after by each society depends on what it is
 accustomed to in general.
The idea of travel for pleasure was not entirely foreign to the Geniza
 people. A Tunisian emigrant, sojourning in Palermo on his way to
 Egypt, suggests to his brother there to come to Sicily "for both pleasure
 and business." The products of the East had a good market on the
 island, and the two brothers would assist each other and be happy to-
 gether.2 Journeys from the city to the countryside and vice versa, or
 from one town to another, when motivated by social reasons, sometimes
 had also a connotation of pleasure trips, including recreation for the
 children who would be freed for some time from the heavy yoke of the
 Bible school.
Some of the Genjza letters betray a certain spirit of adventure, al-
 though this trend is more pronounced in the India trade than in the
 correspondence relating to the Mediterranean. Sons, sometimes evi-
 dently mere boys, urged their fathers to send them overseas to study
 the arcanums of commerce in one of the great business houses abroad. 8
Occasionally, an enterprising young man would leave with goods, but
 without the permission and even knowledge of, his father, who then
 would implore his friends in other places to find out where he was
("some say he followed the army, others, he traveled to Yemen") .4
 A mother from Aden, writing to her son in Old Cairo, scolds him for
having journeyed so far, quoting the biblical verse "The eyes of the
fool are directed to the ends of the earth {Prov. 17:24, still used by the
 Yemenites to ridicule a person who goes far afield while he would do
better to stay put. But the Yemenites are inveterate travelers) .5 "I am
not a seafarer" is said twice in a letter, once by a son who was prepared
to accompany his mother on a voyage despite his dislike for sea travel,







'
 and once by another relaUve who excuses himself for not coming to see
 his father. 6 This shows that people were aware of the fact that wander-
 lust was an individual trait. Many letters reveal that merchants were
 eager to be off as soon as they had returned to their base. (One merchant
 of Old Cairo, writing from Tyre, asks his correspondent in the Egyptian
 capital to settle for him certain important deals, for he would stay only
 a few days when coming home.) 7 It was perhaps only consideration for
 the family which overcame their drive for traveling. This passage in a
 letter to a correspondent overseas is telling: "I am not setting out,
 although it is sailing time, only because I have just come home." 8
The Arabic maxim fi' l-lJ,araka baraka, "there is blessing in move-
 ment," which is also included in the title of an interesting Islamic com-
 pilation on the religious value of commerce and other economic activi-
 ties,9 was the watchword of the period. Breadwinners and beggars, the
 pious and the scholars, all were on the move. How this was done, how
 people traveled and transported their goods is richly illustrated by the
 Geniza documents.


 2. OVERLAND TRAVEL
People preferred to travel by water rather than overland. "If, God
 forbid, I shall miss the boat, I shall travel [from Alexandria] to Tripoli
[Libya] overland." 1 "Cowrie shells," writes a merchant from al-
 Mahdiyya, "have no market here in the winter. They are traded only
 with people coming by sea during the summer. There is no one here
 who would travel by land." 2 The implication of these and similar state-
 ments is that normally, ii one failed to get a passage by ship, one would
 rather wait for the next seafaring season than join a caravan. Wherever
 such an alternative existed, people traveled by sea, even for such short
 distances as Acre-Ramle (via Jaffa), Palestine, or Tyre-Tripoli, Leba-
 non, distances of less than a hundred miles. Inside Egypt, too, transport
 on the Nile and its various arms and canals was the normal means of
 locomotion, wherever feasible. Consequently, while the Geniza records
 abound in details about travel on water, references to travel on land
 are comparatively sparse.
Travelers who did not go on foot used riding beasts. Carriages, so
 common in the Roman period, had completely disappeared and are
 nowhere referred to in the Geniza papers with the possible exception of
 India (where they were drawn by oxen) .8 Generally, one rode a donkey
 or a mule, the latter being reserved for persons of higher standing. "My
 lord [the writer's superior] lent his mule to the elder Abu 'l-Mufa<J<Jal
 and the latter gave me his donkey," writes a government official. From
 the same letter we may conclude that the saddle was of no less im-
 portance for the rider than the riding animal itself. For when setting
 out on his journey, by water, of course, he took saddle and headgear







 with him, in order to be able to hire a donkey at the place where his
 overland journey was to begin! Just as we check our heavy luggage,
 the medieval traveler, when setting out on a longer journey, entrusted
 his bedding, furs, and the clothes he did not need to the "saddlebag,"
 namely of a camel or other beast of transport, while he would ride on a
 donkey or on a mule. We learn about this when, because of special
 circumstances, the heavy luggage was redistributed to the travelers,
 much to their discomfort and that of their mounts. 5 One preferred to
 carry as little baggage as possible. When, in August, 1061, the Jewish
 judge of al-Mahdiyya wished to entrust a manuscript containing six-
 teen quires to "Dama.scenes," which means merchants traveling in the
 caravan heading for Damascus and passing Old Cairo, they refused,
 saying: "We have nowhere to put it." The writer thereupon ensures
 his correspondent in the Egyptian capital that the desired book would
 be sent with the next convoy of ships leaving the shores of Tunisia.11
 Through smaller or partly reclaimed deserts, such as the Sinai penin-
 sula, one could ride on a donkey or on a mule, but over greater stretches
 of wasteland, such as the Libyan desert, even a European visiting that
 country had to accept the hardships of a camel ride.7
Only under quite exceptional circumstances, as when no other means
 of transport were available, would one undertake a journey on foot.
 "After leaving you on Sunday," writes a scholar from Fustat to his
 brother-in-law, a government official in al-Bahnasa, "I went on foot,
 together with 'Imran and Ibrahim, to Minya, looking for a boat. When
 I did not find one, I set out, as I was, walking to al-Jiza [present-day
 Gizeh] and-God is my witness-I plodded along until I arrived on
 Tuesday afternoon almost dead. At the very hour I arrived, there ar-
 rived also the riding beasts belonging to the Amir. This was the blessing
 of my staying with you over the Sabbath." The mounts of the amir
 were perhaps a regular means of transportation, which was not func-
 tioning on schedule on that particular occasion.8
For reasons of safety and convenience, whenever someone set out on a
 more protracted fourney, he traveled in caravans. This was done not
 only for the crossing of a desert, as was required on the journey from
 Cairo to Damascus or from western North Africa to Egypt, but even
 when the way led through such a densely populated area as that
 traversed by the road from Aleppo, Syria, to Tripoli, Lebanon.• Nor-
 mally the size of the caravans is not indicated. When we read in a
 letter that the pilgrims' caravan, which also carried Indian spices and
 other Oriental products from the Red Sea to Cairo in the month of
 January, comprised 500 camels, this is to be taken as a warning to
 merchants that the markets of the capital soon would be swept with
 goods. 10
Of particular importance were the caravans connecting the Muslim
 West: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, with Egypt and other
 countries of the Muslim East. These caravans had a special name,







mawsim, literally: fixed date, season, because they used to set out at
more or less fixed times. The same word designated in the countries of
the Indian Ocean the seasonal winds and has entered the English
language in the form monsoon with this meaning. "The mawsims of the
land and the ships of the sea have arrived, but no letter from you."
References like this are regularly found in letters from Qayrawan.11
The word mawsim designated both the caravan and the fair or business
season connected with its arrival. In a letter sent around 1040 to a
Tunisian merchant sojourning in Egypt, the Qayrawiinese writer states
that he sold four bales of Egyptian flax every day during twenty days
of the mawsim, announcing also that he was sending on the same day
309-¾ dinars to his correspondent.12
 In winter, when the sea was closed to ships, the caravan traffic was of
particular importance. In a normal winter, at least three caravans used
to set out for the East from Qayrawan, which name, incidentally, is
derived from the same Persian word as English caravan.18 When sending
off letters and shipments in the last boats leaving in the autumn, a
merchant would write: the next letters and shipments will follow in the
mawsim, that is, ovcrland.14 Vice versa, letters bearing dates as from
October 15th approximately refer to preceding messages as having been
forwarded "in the ships," implying that they themselves were to be
carried in a caravan.15
 In summer, too, the caravans were vital for the maintenance of a
 continuous traffic. The ships used to sail in convoys mainly in spring-
time and again in fall. In the interval, caravans filled the gap. A
 caravan from Alexandria was expected in Qayrawan by the end of
 August.16 The caravan with the Damascene merchants referred to
 above, page 276, left al-Mahdiyya late in the summer, a short time
 before the sailing of the autumn convoys, and the letter speaking of
 them also went overland. An important message on communal affairs
 was sent from Qayrawan to Ibn 'Awkal in Fustat "with the summer
 caravan," preceded by another letter carried by a merchant who had
 set out in a smaller company one-and-a-half months earlier. This man,
 who happened to be Musa Ibn al-Majjani, the "disciple" of Ibn 'Awkal,
 certainly was expected to make stops in various cities on the way and
 to continue his journey whenever his affairs were settled and a new
 company of travelers was formed. Therefore the writer assumed the
 possibility that the message carried might arrive before the letter en-
 trusted to Ibn al-Majjani, who made his way with a rifqa, or small
 group of fell ow travelers.11
These smaller companies of travelers (also called ~ubba, which
 simply means company) did not have a regular timetable as the
 mawsims had, but set out whenever a sufficient number of wayfarers
 had assembled. "I shall join the first company setting out for Marra-
 kesh," writes a visitor from Spain, staying in Fez, Morocco. 18 When a
 refugee from Alexandria tried to return to his home from Lukk, Libya,







 he was unable to find companions and was forced to make the long
 detour via the oases of western Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Old Cairo,
 which took him six months. 19 Even on a short trip it was absolutely
 unheard of to travel unaccompanied. In a circular, written in spring,
 1176, Samuel b. Eli, the head of the Jewish Academy of Baghdad,
 required of his coreligionists in Egypt, among other things, that they
 provide escorts for his emissaries from one locality to another. 20 Accom-
 panying foreigners on their travels was a work of piety, ascribed in
 Jewish legend to the biblical patriarch Abraham, the paragon of hos-
 pitality.
The overlapping of long and short distance routes has been discussed
 with regard to both seafaring and overland travel in connection with
 the techniques of international commerce.21 That study is comple-
 mented here by an additional observation. The short routes served also
 as substitutes for direct long-distance lines when the latter were missed
 or were otherwise unavailable. Nahray b. Nissim, writing in Old Cairo
 in the month of Shebat (January/February), that is, at a time when
 only overland traffic connected Tunisia with Egypt, sends this informa-
 tion to his correspondent in Bii~ir, about 125 miles south of Cairo:
 "Letters have arrived for you from your uncle [and head of business
 house in Qayrawan], carried by a man from Tripoli, who traveled in the
 Barqa caravan. I forwarded them to you yesterday with so-and-so."
 Thus, these letters had traveled from the capital of Tunisia to Tripoli,
 from there to Barga, and finally to Fustat. Nahray had to give these
 details because his correspondent certainly knew when the through
 caravans from Qayrawan arrived in Egypt and had therefore to re-
 ceive an explanation why the letters of his uncle had arrived at an un-
 expected time. 22
Travel overland was expensive. For the comparatively short distance
 from Tripoli, Libya, to Gabes, Tunisia, a visitor from Italy was charged
 the exorbitant sum of 3 Murabiti dinars (which his local friends advised
 him not to pay) .23 From Bilbays, the last Egyptian town on the route to
 Syria, a camel ride to Damascus cost 2 dinars (including expenses for
 food) .2• On the return route, a traveler paid in al-Mutaylib, a caravan
 station in the Sinai Desert, 4 nuqra dirhems, for reaching Bilbays, a
 distance of about 100 miles.25 Transport costs for a camel load of paper,
 carried in a caravan from Damascus to Cairo, were from 5-½ to 6 gold
 pieces (second half of eleventh century). Moreover, for each load, ¼
 dinar had to be paid to the military escort. As usual, the roads were
 unsafe. For the transport overland of 5 loads of peaches (presumably
 dried) from Acre, Palestine, to Fustat, the same merchant had to pay
 about 5 dinars per LOO pounds. 28
The comparatively high cost of overland travel owed in part to
 its long duration. "Time is money" probably was not a popular slogan
 in the Mediterranean region (I never read it in a Geniza paper, nor







heard it from the mouth of a native), but, as an economic law, it was
efiective nonetheless. As we have seen, the great caravans, by their very
definition, observed a certain schedule. From a letter to Ibn 'Awkal we
learn that a caravan originating in Qayrawan stopped in Gabes, a
prosperous center of commerce, for only a very short time, one day, it
seems, which happened to be a Friday.21 The Sijilmasa caravans, the
main transport from the Muslim Far West, passed Qayrawan accord-
ing to Geniza letters both in January and in August, accepting con-
signments on both occasions, but, according to one report, tarrying only
for a few days in that center of all North African trade.28 Progress in
general was slow. The report just ref erred to makes mention of another
caravan organized in Qayrawan itself, "the like of which has not been
seen before," but which, although setting out in January or early in
February, was not expected to arrive in Cairo before the summer.29
The death of Joseph Ibn Migash, for many years the spiritual leader of
Spanish Jewry, whose eminence was recognized also by the Jews of
Egypt and Yemen, became known in Alexandria only "after the lapse
of seven months," as the writer emphasizes in a letter written in Alex-
andria in November, 1141.80 Despite the close connections of the Jews
of Wargla, a town on the Algerian Sahara, with their relatives in
Jerusalem, two brothers in that town wrote a letter to their brother
in the Holy City a full year after he had died (middle of eleventh
 century).81 Details about the speed of overland communications are
 found in the Geniza mostly in connection with the commercial mail
service (see pp. 281 ff., below).
Slow and costly, as it was, overland travel was certainly not made
 more attractive by the dangers connected with it. Caravans were pro-
 tected by escorts or through payments of "blackmail" to the Bedouins
or potentates through whose territories they passed, often both. Above,
page 278, we saw how much this protection could cost even on a road
 connecting the two main cities of the Fatimid empire. But woe to the
 traveler who happened to come to a place without such prearranged
 agreements. A case in point is a report about events in Tobruk, Libya,
 retold in a letter from Alexandria around 1140. Three parties were
 involved: a Sijilmasa caravan coming from the West, which continued
 its way to Alexandria and brought the news from Tobruk; another
 Sijilmasa caravan going West, in which the writer's friend traveled,
 about whom we shall hear presently; and, finally, "the Sultan's ship,"
 which had cast anchor there and from which a number of merchants had
 disembarked. These were robbed by the local "Arabs," that is, Bed-
 ouins, of everything, including their clothing, but no one, as the writer
 hastens to add, "died," jmplying, it seems, that such an attack was
 normally accompanied by other unpleasant features. When the writer's
 friend, instead of continuing his journey with the caravan, boarded
 the ship, the Bedouins expressed regret that they had not administered







the same treatment to him as to the other passengers of the vessel.
 Clearly he had lost his status as a protected member of a caravan by
 boarding the ship.82
In populated areas, too, travel was insecure. The following report
 from Malij I a little town in the very heart of the Nile Delta, illustrates.
A man had set out from this place for Old Cairo with some goods, in
exchange for which he hoped to acquire merchandise needed to restock
his store. Between two villages, named in the document, he was at-
tacked by bandits, who took away his saddlebag with its contents, as
well as his clothes. Before being attacked, however, he had succeeded
in hiding a part of the goods carried with him. He went back to the
first village, where, it seems, he had friends, and after passing the night
there, he proceeded to the second village, where he informed the local
na'ib, or "substitute" judge, of the brigandage perpetrated in the area
under his jurisdiction. In order to corroborate his statement, he showed
him the goods he had hidden from the bandits. Upon hearing his case,
the na'ib sent two men with him to help him retrieve the lost valuables.
They were hardly out of the village, however, when the man was robbed
and murdered by the two men accompanying him as escort, who also
killed the dead man's donkey, lest the stray animal arouse suspicion.
All these details, the victim's sons claimed1 had been learned from the
villagers, as well as from a statement by the na'ib, who had testified to
a representative of the governor of the Sharqiyya province that the
boys' father had appeared before him. The report was addressed to
Samuel, the Nagid, with the request that it be acted upon at high
quarters. 33 As we shall see later on, travel on the Nile and its canals was
risky, too.
 The relative paucity of Geniza material about overland travel may
owe partly to specific circumstances. Besides the India trade, the bulk
of the interterritorial correspondence preserved is concerned with the
commerce between Egypt and Tunisia. But the latter country, as we
remember, was flooded by the Bedouin hordes of the Hila.I and Sulaym
in the late 1050's, an event that greatly impaired overland traffic in
North Africa. It must be remarked, however, that during the first half
of the eleventh century I long before the disastrous invasion of the Arab
tribes, international trade, as far as reflected in the Geniza, used mari-
time transportation to an incomparably higher degree than overland
transportation. Here it is perhaps appropriate to draw attention to a
certain disability of the writers of the Geniza letters, who, as Jews,
were prevented by the injunctions of their religion to travel on Satur-
days and holidays. A Jew traveling in a caravan, when his day of rest
approached, either stayed behind or hurried ahead of the caravan so
that he could observe his Sabbath, and both alternatives are mentioned
in our records. This procedure required an escort of Bedouin guides,
which was both expensive and not without danger." The refugee from
Alexandria, referred to above, page 277, writes in 1131 that most of the







 money he carried with him on his desert trip was spent for the Sabbaths
and the holidays and "the protection" they required.85 A traveler from
Amul, Tabaristan, to Baghdad states, a hundred years earlier, that half
his money "went for the Sabbaths" on a journey that caused him the
greatest discomfort. Since he had 150 dinars left over, his expenses for
hjs weekly stopovers must have been very considerable indeed.111 If the
traveler was rich and influential, he could induce the whole caravan
to make a stop for his sake, as did a purveyor to the Fatimid court in
spring, 1100, when he took to Egypt a group of refugees from Palestine,
who had escaped the Crusaders' massacres. The report says that both
Passover and the Sabbaths were kept by the group on their way owing
to the munificence of that man. 87 It may be noted that these conditions
remained unchanged down to the nineteenth century. The renowned
Orientalist, Professor A. S. Yahuda, recounts in his collected essays
that when his grandfather emigrated in 1852 from Baghdad to Jeru-
salem and was traveling from the former town to Aleppo in northern
Syria by caravan, he stipulated that it make a stop each Saturday, for
which arrangement he paid a huge amount of money.88
 Merchants accompanying consignments could not incur such ex-
penses, nor take the risks that a Sabbath rest behind or in advance of a
caravan involved. We find, therefore, that shipments, when going over a
desert route at all, were confided to Muslim business friends. In a letter
dispatched from Qayrawan early in the eleventh century, the addressees
in Old Cairo are requested to send textiles by caravan "with trust-
worthy Muslims. 11 89 Somewhat later, a correspondent is advised to
forward goods with the Mecca pilgrim Ali, the Sicilian, another Mecca
pilgrim called by name, or a person from a certain Bedouin family.'°
Non-Muslims did not travel in a pilgrim's caravan even on its way
back from Egypt to the West.'1 It was not always possible to find a
traveler prepared to transport other people's shipments. Even in the
exceptionally large caravan organized in Qayrawin, referred to page
279, above, a writer complains, he was unable to ship a package con-
taining a hundred or so pieces of clothing." This state of affairs explains
the frequency of partnerships between Tunisian Jews and Muslims
encountered in the second part of the eleventh century.
Thus, the Geniza papers cannot be regarded as a representative
source of information on the caravan traffic in medieval Islam. For this
deficiency we are richly compensated by the abundance of material
about the commercial mail service, a subject practically unknown to us
from other sources.


 3. THE COMMERCI AL OVERLAND MAIL SERVICE
 Day in, day out, we make use of the services of the mail. It is part
 of our lives. But we are hardly aware of the fact that this vital human







 institution is of comparatively recent creation and its beginnings have
 been thus far rather obscure. To be sure, the courier post of the rulers
 goes back to the ancient East i it served them as a means for watching
over the loyalty of their officials and other subjects and thus for keeping
their realms together. In Europe, too, the princely mail is old. The
needs of the population at large for regular and inexpensive communi-
cation, however, have not attracted the attention of the chroniclers.
Even the voluminous writings of the Muslim historians (as from the
ninth century A.n.) have not yet yielded data about a mail service
available to the ordinary citizen. The merchant communities in the
chief trading centers of western Europe created some such service about
which a trickle of information begins to appear by the end of the twelfth
century.1 But it took a long time before this courier service, owing to
the initiative of the Venetians, was thrown open to the use of the public.
In view of this, it is gratifying to find that the Geniza documents pro-
vide us with detailed information about a ramified overland mail
service, commercially operated as early as the beginning of the eleventh
century. The service itself might have been considerably older than the
data preserved through the Geniza.2
 The subject of this section, then, is not the barid, the governmental
courier and intelligence service, which has often been treated, but the
commercial post used by the population at large. To a certain extent,
the mail service run by private enterprise was modeled after the fashion
of the governmental barid. Therefore a few words are provided about
the latter before enlarging on the commercial post.
 The bar1d was taken over by the Arabs from the Persians, as is
proved by the terms used and by other evidence. It was linked up, albeit
loosely, with similar services in the Chinese and Byzantine empires.
A. Mez makes the interesting observation that this institution must
have been invented in one particular state from where it was subse-
quently transferred to others, for in all the three services, the Islamic,
the Chinese, and the Byzantine, it was customary to dock the tails of
the mounts used in them. 8 Such a specific trait could hardly have been
invented independently in three different places. Muslim writers de-
rived the very word barid from this custom of shortening the tails of
the government mounts, buriden meaning cutting in Persian. Barid,
however, no doubt comes from the Latin veredarius, a word that is
common in Talmudic literature under the form beldii.r, buldii.r, and is
found also in Syriac. The Arabic form of the word is nearer to the Latin
and Greek forms than the Hebrew and Aramaic ones. Thus, it stands
to reason that the widely traveled Arabs became familiar with this
Roman institution directly and long before Islam. This would explain
why the word barid was used also in the Islamic East. On the other
hand, the Romans themselves might have learned from the Persians.
As is well known, Herodotus describes the governmental post as a







 Persian invention. It might have been based, however, on Babylonian
 antecedents.
Of late, the subject has been treated by Dominique Sourdel in the
 new edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam.• A few relevant items may
 be added to the data provided there. Six papyri preserved in the John
 Rylands Library, Manchester, and edited by D. S. Margoliouth, deal
 with the subject. In these, the tjii/J,ib bar'id Ushmiin, the postmaster of
 Ushmiin in Upper Egypt, is advised by his superior to let certain gov-
 ernment messengers, including one from the governor himself, ride on
 the mounts of the barid. Thus we see that even a government official
 could not make use of this service without the written permission of the
 governor of the province. These papyri, which come from the years
 A.H. 134-136 (A.D. 751-753), are the more interesting, as they repeat-
 edly make mention of the diibbat furiiniq, the courier's mount.
 Furaniq is a Persian word, common in the Babylonian Talmud under
 the form parwanqii and found in pre-Islamic poetry in a poem by
 Imru' ul-Qays. More is said about this Talmudic word later.11
Attention should also be given to an even earlier document, mention-
 ing the barid, a dispatch written on leather and sent in 717-718 by a
 Soghdian prince to his Arab superior far away in Central Asia.8
In Umayyad times the barid was most important as a means of mili-
 tary communication. When al-~ajjaj, the viceroy of Iraq, sent a
 mighty force, the jaysh at-tawiiwis, "the peacock army," against the
 Turkish ruler of Kabul in present-day Afghanistan, the army never
 proceeded without first establishing relay stations equipped with barid
 mounts in its rear. 7
 Albert Dietrich, in his publication of Arabic letters from the Ham-
 burg papyri collection, provides some additional details on the barid. 8
 An Arabic Ph.D. dissertation dealing with the subject contain.a a useful
 survey of the widely dispersed information."
In general, the Geniza records had no opportunity to refer to the
 governmental post, as far as it existed in their time. One passage from
 a letter written around 1210 has some bearing on the subject. Its writer
 was a Jewish scholar from Jerusalem who was connected with the then
 governor of that city, al-Muwaffaq Niir al-Dawla, possibly because his
 son, known from other letters as a physician, served the governor in
 this capacity. Because of the Sabbath, on which a Jew, as we know, was
 not supposed to travel, the scholar had been detained in a1-Mutay1ib; a
 caravan station in the Sinai Desert. After having described the hard-
 ships endured on his journey the writer continues: "When the )?earer
 of this letter, namely the messenger, rasul, of the Sultan-may God
 grant him victory-passed through, he most kindly said: write a letter
 and I shall transmit it for you. Thus I instructed him to deliver it to
 one of the servants of the illustrious great lord AI-Muwaffaq ·Niir
 al-Dawla for transmittance to my son." On the reverse side, in addition







 to the address, the following remark is written in Arabic letters:
 "balligh tu/jar" ("Deliver and you will receive reward [namely from
 God]"). This phrase, which is written on scores of Geniza letters
 means: "The forwarding of this letter is a personal favor. No payment
 is to be made for it." This shows that the rasiil, like the ancient couriers
 of the barid, was a man of higher standing and knew the scholar well
 from previous visits to Jerusalem. Moreover, the whole tenor of the
 passage seems to indicate that the appearance of the rasiil in al-
 Mutaylib was not an extraordinary coincidence, but a regular occur-
 rence. The only fact emphasized as noteworthy in the letter was the
 courtesy of the courier who did a personal favor to the writer.10
As noted, commercial mail service was to a certain extent organized
 on the lines of the barid. Its very nomenclature points in this direction:
 The couriers were called fayj, plural fuyuj, an Arabization of Persian
 payk, which is derived from pa, foot. Literally, the word means runner,
 but it was a most common term for the riders of the barid.11 From the
 noun fayj, a verb fayyaj, "to use the services of a courier," was derived
 in the Geniza, but has not yet been found in another source.12 The
 Hebrew equivalent of fayj in the Geniza records is r~, runner, which
 is the biblical word from the book of Esther designating the Persian
 payk.18 Fayj was used in Spain and all over North Africa, including
 Egypt. On the route between Cairo, Jerusalem, Tyre, and Damascus,
 the word kutubi, bearer of kutub, letters, was the common term.1' In
 one and the same letter, couriers operating between Egypt and Jeru-
 salem are referred to as kutubiyyin and those going to the Muslim
 West as fuyiij. 15 In Arabia, that is, on the way between Aden via the
 ij:ijaz to Cairo, the more classical aJIJ,iib al-kutub, "couriers of letters,"
 seems to have been preferred. In the two cases traced thus far, the mail
 was sent on the unsafe desert route in two copies, that is, ·by two differ-
 ent couriers.16 In a list of Jewish taxpayers from Fustat the word rasiil,
 messenger, appears as the name of an occupation.17 A letter from
 Alexandria from the beginning of the thirteenth century has this post-
 script: "I missed the rasiil. Therefore my letter is late." 18 All this seems
 to indicate that rasiil was applied also to the regular mail service, a
 usage reflecting perhaps also on the meaning of the governmental rasiil
 appearing in Fatimid and Ayyubid times (cf. above, p. 283).
The commercial fuyiij, like the barid, were found solely on land
(but also on boats sailing along the Syro-Palestinian coast and prob-
 ably also on the Nile River and its canals). Although the volume of
 maritime traffic outstripped transportation by land many times, we
 never find a fayj on a ship going overseas. During summer, roughly
 between April and September, letters were sent ft 'l-mariikib, "in the
 ships" (in the plural, because for reasons of safety normally several
 copies were dispatched). These letters were confided to business friends,
 and in case there were none on a ship, which rarely happened, the
 captain or a sailor did the job. In winter, roughly between October and







March, one used the services of the fuyiij. In summer, too, the fuyiij
were not out of business, as far as international traffic was concerned.
As has been pointed out above (p. 277), the ships used to sail in convoys,
in spring normally from the end of April to the beginning of June and
in the fall from the middle of August to the end of September. In be-
tween, caravans and fuyuj filled the gap left by overseas transporta-
tion. This restriction of the commercial mail service to overland travel
is an additional indication that it originated in Persia, a continental
country, and not in Byzantium, an essentially maritime power.
There was another most characteristic aspect in which the commer-
cial fuyuj followed the example of the governmental barid. This in-
stitution maintained relay stations where the riding animals-mules,
horses, or camels-were frequently changed, but one and the same
messenger carried the dispatches entrusted to him from the starting
point to the final destination. The same was done by the private
couriers. One man would carry the mail from Qayrawan all the way
along to Cairo, or even from Almeria, Spain, through the whole of
North Africa straight to Alexandria.111 It is also not exc1uded that there
was direct service between Baghdad and Qayrawan, for a man writing
from the latter city to Ibn 'Awkal in Old Cairo says: "In these days
there arrived many letters with the fuyuj which were dated six months
back in Baghdad." But these might not have come to Qayrawan di-
rectly, but might have been forwarded to the writer through business
 friends in Old Cairo other than lbn 'Awkal.20
Many Geniza letters contain expressions of apprehension that they
might fall into the hands of unauthorized persons. In order to avoid
such occurrences, one confided one's correspondence either to a close
business friend or to a trusted fayj. Therefore, it is not surprising that
the names of such mail carriers are mentioned repeatedly, which shows
that they were personally known both to the senders and to the ad-
 dressees. Thus far, I have noted four such cases for the route Tunisia-
 Egypt, seven for that of Alexandria-Cairo, and one for Cairo-Ramle.
 But there are more.
It was perhaps due to the confidential nature of the courier's occu-
 pation that Jews, too, were engaged in it, although this must have
 involved the persons concerned in many difficulties because of the
 prohibition of travel on Sabbath. Jews appear in this capacity on the
 routes Alexandria-Cairo, Egypt-Palestine, and perhaps also Egypt-
 Tunisia. Most of the fuyuj must have been Muslims, as is proved by
 their names and also by the fact that Nahray once acknowledges re-
 ceipt of a letter from Alexandria carried by "a Jewish fayj," which
 he would not have said had many Jews been active in this fi.eld. 21 At a
 certain period, Jews were perferred on the Cairo-Alexandria route. In a
 letter from Alexandria, which was carried by a fayj called Jacob (not
 Ya'qub, the Arabic form of the name), the writer says that he had sent
 other letters "with a Muslim," and whatever other letters he would







forward with Muslims would be delivered to "the House of 1Abd," a
Muslim postal agency known from other letters.22 Three other fuyiij
commuting between Alexandria and Cairo had names extremely com-
mon among Jews (but borne also by Muslims).23 A Jewish special mes-
senger going from Alexandria to the capital of Egypt is also men-
tioned. 24 Of particular interest is a note in the Hebrew language by
"Miisa (Moses) b. Joseph, the Red, the runner," in which he conveys
his greetings to the Gaon Joshiah, the head of the academy in Jerusalem
 (around 1015), adding that he was going back to Egypt. Normally, we
must assume, he carried the letters all the way from Cairo to Jerusalem.
This time, he had to turn back to Egypt immediately after his arrival
in Ramle, the administrative capital and traffic center of Palestine,
wherefore he forwarded the letters destined for Jerusalem with a Mus-
lim colleague. We see here that a courier was a person important enough
to address the Gaon and to assure him of his loyalty.25
The Jewish courier was also needed for another purpose. When the
mail arrived, the womenfolk, most of whom did not know how to read,
needed someone to read it out to them. "\\'hen no one else was around,
the courier did the job, and letters written by Jews, we remember,
normally were written in Hebrew characters. This situation is well
illustrated by a passage from a letter of an elderly lady in Qayrawiin
writing to her brothers out on a business trip in Egypt: "Your letters
to your families reporting your well-being have arrived. I went to the
 fayj and he read them out to me in full. I was very sad to note that
I did not see from any one of you greetings to me, let alone a letter." 211
The seasoned courier probably allowed himself this little break of con-
 fidence because he knew that the brothers would not mind, since the
 letters from the foreign country would be read out again and again any-
 way in the family assemblies back home in Qayrawiin. Whether this
 particular fayj had come all the way from Alexandria or had picked
 up the Egyptian mail in al-Mahdiyya cannot be decided. In this con-
 nection, attention should be drawn to an Aramaic proverb, which occurs
 several times in the Babylonian Talmud: "The man who is able to
 read a letter should become its bearer" ("qaryiinii de'iggarta ihu lehwe
 parwanqii") . This shows that in Sasanid Persia too, a man was chosen
 as parwanqa, furaniq, or courier, because of his knowledge of reading.
There was a marked difference between the postal service on the
 route connecting the capital of the Fatimid empire with its Asian de-
 pendencies and those operating on all other routes represented in the
 Geniza. This important aspect is discussed at the end of this section.
 In general, we do not find that the fuyiij were organized in a guild or
 any other form of permanent cooperative association. Still, there must
 have been some kind of regular arrangements among them, for our
 records often speak about them in the plural and indicate that they set
 out or arrived at more or less fixed times. A man from the East writes to
 Tunisia: "Dispatch the goods in the first ship sailing [in spring), but







 in the meantime acknowledge with the couriers the arrival of my
 shipments." 27 A widow in Tunisia, writing to her brother in Egypt
 complains: "The couriers have arrived, but with no letter from you." 28
 In a long epistle going from Old Cairo to Jerusalem we read: "The
 letters of so-and-so will be forwarded to you with the couriers." 29 In
 two letters, one written in Fustat and one in al-Mahdiyya, great con-
 cern was expressed when the fuyuj had not arrived by the month of
 January.80
The regularity of this postal service is also attested by those pas-
 sages in the Geniza records where the addressee is implored to use
 it (and not to wait until some business friend would make the journey).
 In a letter dispatched from Qayrawan to Old Cairo in 1022, Rabbenii
 Nissim b. Jacob asks Ibn 'Awkal in Fustat five times that his letters
 be forwarded to Baghdad by courier and that the answers from there be
 brought to him via Egypt through the same service. 81 In a detailed
 business letter from al-Mahdiyya, the writer's partner in Fustat is re-
 quested to send a letter "with every fayj." 82 A man from Tripoli, Libya,
 writing to the East, asks the addressee to answer by all means "even
 with the couriers." He meant to say that it was preferable to spend
 money on the forwarding of letters than to delay their dispatch.33 The
 postal service between Alexandria and Cairo was so regular that a
 merchant, writing from the capital, would express his disappointment
when, on a Thursday, no mail had arrived from his business correspond-
 ent in Alexandria. He himself, writing on Sunday, remarks: "I have
 already sent you another letter before the Sabbath," presumably on
 Friday with the courier going back to the Mediterranean port. 84 In
 another letter from Cairo to Alexandria we read: "Send your answer
 with the courier who sets out at the appointed time, do not miss him." 85
 These two items come from the second half of the eleventh century. At
 least a hundred and fifty years later we see Judge Elijah of Fust.at
 asking a relative of his in Alexandria to send him a letter every week
(or: every Friday), which can only mean by mail. 86 A similar request
 is made by an Egyptian merchant on a business trip to Tyre, Lebanon,
 from his partner back home in Fustat. He also promises to write every
 week-and he seems to have kept his promise, for in the course of the
 years seven of his letters to his partner have come to light, most of
 which must have been written on the same business trip to Palestine,
 Lebanon, and Syria.87 A third instance of a weekly postal service con-
 cerns Qu~, the main city of Upper Egypt. Around 1030, a communal
 leader in Old Cairo writes to a friend sojourning in Qii~: "I regularly
 send you every Monday two letters." Perhaps the couriers to a city
 that at that time still was largely Christian were Christians themselves
 and used to set out on the day after their weekly day of rest. 88
A final indication of the regularity and wide scope of the commercial
 mail service is its relatively inexpensive cost. For a letter coming
 originally from al-Mahdiyya and forwarded from Alexandria to Old







 Cairo exactly 1 dirhem was paid.89 For another letter from Tunisia
 forwarded from Alexandria together with a package of letters wrapped
 in a kerchief and destined for another person only half a silver piece
 was stipulated. In the latter case, the carrier was perhaps Jewish, since
 the address is in Hebrew characters only. This would explain the
 difference in the price; the clientele of the Jewish fuyiij was limited.40
 The same price of half a dirhem was charged for a letter sent from
 Jerusalem to Ramle, a far shorter trip, but perhaps more dangerous at
 that time. 41 The letter from Almeria, Spain, to Alexandria (seep. 285)
 cost 1-½ dirhems, four letters having been dispatched to the same
 address. In all these cases, payment was to be made after delivery.
It is instructive to compare these fees for the regular mail service
 with the remuneration paid to a special messenger. Such a messenger
 going from Alexandria to Old Cairo received a dinar in advance, which
 would mean perhaps that he received additional payment after de-
 livery of his message,4 2 for another messenger got 1-½ dinars for the
 same route 43 and a third one, 1-¼ dinars plus expenses.44 This is about
 fifty times as much as the regular mail. A messenger sent from Cairo to
 Qii~ in Upper Egypt was promised besides his expenses 1-¾ dinars, of
 which a quarter was paid to him in advance, while the addressee was
 asked "to honor" him, which probably meant giving him additional
 remuneration. These special messengers are referred to as rasiil in
 Arabic and shali'a~ in Hebrew. 45
On several letters sent from the cities of Palestine, Syria, and Leba-
 non we find this note written in the hand of the dispatching postal agent
 '(not in that of the writer of the letter): "To be delivered immediately
 upon arrival." Or letters occasionally contain instructions for the ad-
 dressee to fetch his mail from such-and-such an agency. From these
 and previous references the following picture of the delivery of the mail
 emerges: The couriers used to arrive at comparatively regular inter-
 vals. The more prominent merchants received their mail in their offices,
 including that destined for their business friends. Others had to inquire
 at the postal agents whether anything had arrived for them. This ap-
 plied in particular to travelers. "I asked all the couriers," writes a man
 from Tunisia en route in Palestine, "but did not find with them any-
 thing from you." 46 Urgent messages or those which the addressee could
 not expect, were earmarked for special delivery.
The names of many postal agents are known to us on the route be-
 tween Old Cairo and the cities of Asia. In one case in which we have
 information about such an agent, namely "the House of 1Abd," who has
 been mentioned before in another connection, we know that he was a
 perfumer and representative of merchants who had his store near the
 Bath of the Mice, a largely Jewish neighborhood. Representatives of the
 merchants were indeed the natural depositaries for letters.47
It must have been customary that couriers on their way back advised
 the senders of the duly effected delivery of their messages. For in many







 letters we find the assertion that the writer had no doubt that a previous
letter to the addressee on the matter had reached him. Thus, a short note
 from Jerusalem dealing with one single topic was followed by another
 by the same writer devoted to the same subject and sent through the
 same postal agency in Fustat as the first. The second letter expressed
the certain belief that the first had arrived, a fact confirmed by the
 Geniza finds. The writer's assertion presumably was based on informa-
tion and not on mere surmise. Similar examples could be provided from
other cities.48
Nowhere do we find that purses with money or consignments of goods
 were entrusted to couriers. The absence of relevant data cannot be mere
 chance since many letter writers complain of having no one with whom
to send specified sums or goods. "Fire burns in my heart," writes a
traveler from Spain to his father from Fez, Morocco, "that I have
 collected here gold and find no one with whom I could send it to you." 411
This exclusive role of the couriers as bearers of letters safeguarded their
.security. Since it was known to everyone that they did not carry valu-
 ables, they were left alone by bandits and soldiers.
How did the commercial mail couriers travel? As far as our sources
 go, we must conclude that this service possessed no relay stations of its
 own, but had to utilize the regular caravan traffic and other means of
 transportation. Therefore, we frequently read: "Other letters will fol-
 low with the caravan," or "I sent you letters with the caravan," ex-
 pressions that are used in the same sense as references to mailing with
 couriers.50 Staying with a caravan in the towns visited also gave the
courier opportunity to collect additional mail. This aspect is well illus-
trated in a letter sent from al-Madhiyya around 1060. The writer had
sent a letter to his brother in Fustat with a courier going East. Shortly
afterward he received a message from his brother that a son was born
to the latter. At least a week later, the brother in al-Madhiyya wrote a
letter of congratulations, expressing in it the hope that the letter would
still reach the courier in Sfax, a town in southeast Tunisia, situated on
the caravan route to Egypt.111
 With this we have arrived at our last question: the speed of this com-
mercial mail service. Naturally, we cannot expect uniformity. Two
letters from Alexandria addressed to Ibn 'Awkal bear a note as to the
date of their arrival in Fustat, for it was usual in that big business
house to date the mail received. One arrived on the first of the Muslim
month Rabi' II, A.H. 421, which fell, according to astronomical calcula-
tion, on Wednesday, April 8, 1030. It was written on the 28th of the
Jewish month, which corresponded to the preceding Friday. The letter
no doubt was delivered to a Muslim courier before the beginning of the
Sabbath, on Friday afternoon, and thus arrived after a lapse of five
days.112 Perhaps it was only four days. For the Muslim calendar used
to be fixed according to the actual observation of the new moon, and
since in that year the corresponding Jewish new-moon day (which was







 astronomically established), fell on Monday, April 6th, possibly the
 first of Rabi' II that year actually corresponded to Tuesday.&3 The
 second letter referred to was written on Thursday, October 1, 1030,
 which, according to the writer (but not the astronomical calculation)
 was the Jewish day of the new moon, and arrived on the sixth of the
 corresponding Muslim month, that is, again five days later. In the letter
 itself the writer mentions that his own uneventful trip from Fustat to
 Alexandria had consumed six days and that he had arrived two days
 before, namely, on Tuesday.54 A special messenger made the round trip
 Alexandria-Cairo-Alexandria in seven days. Since he was not delayed
 by distributing and collecting mail or other business, each way had not
 required more than three or three-and-a-half days.55 As to the Asian
 route, a letter from Old Cairo was received in Ascalon, Palestine, twelve
 days after the date on which it was written. Considering that the way
 is about two-and-a-half times as long as that between Alexandria and
 Fustat, this is not bad. 56
The data ascertained thus far for the duration of the couriers' trips
 from Tunisia to Egypt show great discrepancies, reflecting the different
 types of caravans in which they traveled. A letter written in Qayrawan
 on August 21, 1008, arrived in Ibn 'Awkal's office in Old Cairo on No-
 vember 1st of the same year. It is not entirely excluded, however, that
 it was dispatched in a ship and forwarded with delay from Alexandria.117
 On the fifth day of the Jewish month of Heshvan, which corresponds
 approximately to October 15th, the writer mentions that a fayj called
 Khiyar arrived in al-Mahdiyya from Alexandria announcing that a
 fall convoy of six Tunisian ships had arrived safely in that port. This
 runner could hardly have been on his way for more than one month,
 since the ships used to sail from Tunisia in August.68 A letter from
 Qayrawan, written on August 9, 1052, which was Elul 10, states: "Just
 now there arrived with a courier your letter [ from Alexandria] dated a
few days before the end of Sivan." Thus, this courier needed about two-
 and-a-half months for the trip from EgypL to Tunisia.119 A letter re-
ceived by Ibn 'Awkal on May 13, 1011, was dispatched from Tunisia
 two months and seventeen days before.60 Another letter from al-
 Mahdiyya, written at the end of August reports arrival of a courier
from Alexandria who had been on his way for three months and five
 days. 61
 The connection with Qu~ in Upper Egypt was amazingly slow. In one
case it took a full fifty days for a letter from Old Cairo to reach that
city. This shows again that the fuyuj normally used the regular means
of transportation, for in another document we read that a family needed
forty-five days for the same journey.62
 Under these circumstances it is not surprising that we find also a
 fayj tayyar, an express courier, something in between a regular fayj,
 who moved too slowly, and a special messenger, who was too expensive.
 In one and the same letter we read about a regular fayj, who was prob-







ably Jewish (his name was Suriir, Hebrew Siml)ii, "Happiness" a com-
mon Jewish name in those days) and an express courier called Mul}am-
mad. 89 When an Alexandrian bids his business correspondent in Old
Cairo, tufayyir li kitiibak, "fly your letter to me," he most probably
referred not to carrier pigeons, but to this express service. Carrier pi-
geons might be intended in another letter, which says: "Send me the
barii' (release or receipt) with the bearer of this letter or with the birds,"
walaw kiin illa ma'a 'l-tayr, possibly a technical term, parallel to the
usual requests to send a letter either "by boat," or "with the fuyiij." &&
A Muslim report about friends in the cities of Qayrawiin and Tunis who
communicated with each other by carrier pigeons at the time of the
amir Batlis (d. 1016), seems to indicate that they put this service also
at the disposal of others. 85
As alluded to above, the mail service between the capital of the
Fatimid empire and its Asian dependencies, Palestine, Syria, and Leb-
anon, differed from that on the routes connecting it with the cities and
towns of Egypt or those of North Africa and Spain. Only Tinnis, which
was situated on the route to Palestine, shared the characteristics of the
Asian mail. On the reverse sides of letters from Damascus, Aleppo,
Tyre, Acre, Ramie, and, above all, Jerusalem, there are often found
hastily written notes, mostly consisting of two groups of names, but
sometimes containing also short remarks about the place or the urgency
of delivery. Since these note·s are invariably in a handwriting different
from that of the address and at first glance, appear as meaningless
scribbles, I disregarded them as having no bearing on the content of
the letters on whose backs they were found. To the best of my knowl-
edge, none of the editors of Geniza letters has ever so much as mentioned
their existence. Closer study of these notes proved, however, that they
might provide us with welcome additional information on the techniques
of the kutubiyyin, as the mailmen on the Asian route were called.
 Once alerted to the possible significance of these scrawls, I first tried
to make sure that they really represented notes of postal agencies and
not, for instance, additional addresses written by Muslim merchants to
whom Jewish business friends might have entrusted their letters. A
scrutiny of a great number of items showed that the same forwarding
agencies were used by different letter writers, while the same person
would use two or more agencies. Since the same system could be ob-
served in all Asian cities connected with Old Cairo, while no similar
notes have been found in any of the many hundreds of letters coming
from Alexandria, or the cities of Tunisia, it is obvious that we are deal-
ing here with a regular service, not with occasional favors. Such favors
were of course extended by business friends in the East, just as in the
West. When we find many letters sent from Asian cities which do not
bear on their reverse sides notes of the character just described, this
means that they were carried by acquaintances, either Jewish or
Muslim. But where we do find such notes, they must be the work of







 professional postal agencies. I attempt to explain why the fuyiij, the
 commercial letter carriers of the West, did not adopt the system of the
 eastern kutubiyyin at the end of this section.
 The survey of the relevant material presented in the following is
 perforce of a preliminary nature. Of some reverse sides of letters, which
 contained only the addresses, I possess no photostats. The notes of the
 postal agencies are often scribbled in such an abbreviated way that it is
 impossible (at least1 for me) to decipher them without having at hand
 other examples that might be contained in manuscripts not yet studied
 for this purpose. And, as usual in the Geniza, often exactly the part of
 the note which is interesting for us is tom away. Yet, some basic facts
 emerge quite clearly.
Eli I ha-Kohen b. Ezekiel I, a scholar living in Jerusalem around
 the middle of the eleventh century, was an assiduous letter writer (I call
 him "It to distinguish him from his grandson and namesake who was
 active fifty years later). Five letters of his were sent through 'Umar b.
 Yusuf and Son(s) to a postal agency in Old Cairo, called three times
 "al-ij:usayn b. 'fahir," and twice "Naja' b. al-I;Iusayn al-An!;liri and
 Tamim b. Naja'." 116 An1;1ari is undoubtedly a Muslim family name, and
 so is the proper name 'Umar. Naji' continued the business of his father
 and Tamim most probably was his cousin, not his son, for otherwise the
 address would hav.e been "and Tamim, his son." (For further details,
 see below.) The same two agencies, that of 'Umar in Jerusalem and that
 of the An!;liiri family in Fustat appear at least nine times on letters
 sent by Israel b. Na~han-Sahlun, twice in the full form as above,81 five
 times with the father's name alone, 88 once as "al-ij:usayn b. Tahir and
 son," 611 and once with the son's name "Naji' b. al-ij:usayn al-An1;1iri,"
 but without the cousin.10 A third Jewish letter writer who used to for-
 ward part of his correspondence from Jerusalem to Fustat through these
 agencies was Abun b. $adaqa al-Maghribi, two letters being addressed
 to al-ij:usayn b. Tahir 11 and one to what we have assumed we~ two
 cousins.72 A facsimile of the latter accompanies its edition so that the
 interested reader may form an idea how these notes of the mailmen
 looked. He should bear in mind of course that these complicated and
 partly effaced Arabic scribbles could be safely deciphered only be-
 cause they recur in quite a number of instances.
 In a letter sent from Jerusalem somewhat earlier than the three groups
 discussed, the forwarding agency was again 'Umar b. Yusuf, this time
 not "and Son(s) 11 but "and Company." Itis not difficult to surmise what
 happened. When a son, and later two more sons, grew up the courier
 disposed of his partners. Here, also his family name is provided, perhaps
 because the firm then was relatively new, but the evasive Arabic script
 permits a great variety of possible readings. The same applies to the
 family name of the receiving agency, which was different from that, or,
 rather, those, mentioned before, namely "al-:ij:usayn b. Mufarrij and
 Son." 71







The four Jewish persons mentioned or alluded to above also used
 the services of another agency in Jerusalem, called Mu}.iammad b.
 'fahir, in one case with the addition "and Son." In three instances the
 letters were addressed to one Naja' b. Tahir, probably a brother of both
 Mu}.iammad and al:.J;Iusayn and father of Tamim, who, as was assumed
 earlier, was a cousin of Naja' b. I;Iusayn (see the family tree in n. 86).
 One letter entrusted to Mu}:iammad was forwarded by him to "the store
 of the perfumer 'Abd [a Muslim name] at the Bath of the Mice" (a
 bathhouse with this uninviting name occurs in other Geniza documents
 and is mentioned by Muslim antiquarians) .74 Several letters forwarded
through Mu}Jammad bear the remark: "to be delivered immediately
 upon arrival," and it is not excluded that he specialized in the carrying
of urgent messages.T5
Other courier firms active in Jerusalem and Old Cairo appear in
 the Geniza letters. But before turning to them we had better consider
 first correspondence sent from other cities and partly handled by mem-
 bers of the families of kutubiyyin with whom we have made acquaint-
 ance thus far. In Tyre, on the Lebanese coast, then occuying the promi-
nence of Beirut today, seven letters were entrusted by five different
Jewish persons to an agency called" 'Ali b. A};lmad and his sons Al_imad
 and ij:asan." In three cases, in which the address is fully preserved, the
letters go to Naja. 1 b. ij:usayn al-An~ari and his son al-ij:usayn in Old
Cairo, in two others to the same man in Jerusalem, in a sixth instance
to 'Umar b. Yusuf, also in Jerusalem. It is very likely that Naja' or his
son carried the letters in person from Tyre to Jerusalem and from there
to Old Cairo.Ts An eighth letter was sent by Moses b. Jacob, one of the
Jewish persons referred to, from Tyre to Old Cairo through two agencies
not known yet from another source,77 but the same man sent two letters
from Damascus to the Egyptian Clapital through one al-l{asan b.
Mu}.lammad to ij:usayn b. 'fii.hir, the kutubi from the An~ari family
met earlier.Ts A letter from the south Palestinian port Ascalon went to
 (or, rather, with) Naja' b. al-ij:usayn a1-An~ari,711 while at least three
letters from Tinnis, sent by three different persons through agencies not
yet identified, were entrusted to ij:usayn b. 'fahir, who in one instance
is called not by his family name but by the profession of his father or
grandfather al-Numruqi, the Maker of Saddle Pads. 80
Moses b. Jacob, the Cairene merchant who had used the services of
the An~ari family while dispatching letters from Damascus, sent letters
from Jerusalem through another agency to a1-ij:asan b. 'Ahd al-Ral_imii.n
in Old Cairo, and so did a Jewish scholar of Jerusalem writing to
Ephraim b. Shemarya, the spiritual leader of the Synagogue of the
Palestinians in Old Cairo.81 The same kutubi was employed by Nahray
b. Nissim on the opposite route, namely, while writing from Old Cairo
to Jerusalem. 112 The agencies appearing on letters sent from Tripoli
 (Lebanon), Acre, or Ramle to Old Cairo or from the latter city to Tyre,
differed from those studied thus far as well as from one another, and







their occurrence is too sporadic for permitting conclusions. 88 Of particu-
lar interest is the reverse side of a letter sent from Aleppo to Nahray in
 Fustat. In addition to the address written in both Arabic and Hebrew
 by the sender and besides the usual pair of names of carriers it has a
 note in a third hand: "to be transmitted by Hiba etc." This seems to
 indicate that the agencies concerned did not, keep a continuous service
 between the two cities, but transferred the correspondence entrusted
 to them to another carrier somewhere midway, say, in Tyre. Nor did
 the government postal service, as we know from Mamluk times, main-
 tain a direct connection between Cairo and Aleppo. The adventures of
 this particular letter were not terminated with this. A fourth hand
 added:"To the island of Sicily." Nahray was on one of his trips to the
 West. Forwarding overseas was not the responsibility of the couriers,
 however, and no remark to this effect is found on the page. 8 '
The data assembled above show that the couriers on the route between
 the capital of the Fatimid empire and its Asian dependencies were gen-
 erally organized in partnerships, predominantly fami 1.y partnerships:
 fathers and sons, brothers, cousins, and members of more ramified con-
 nections.85 Three generations of the An!;!ii.ri couriers were traced above
 as having been active in Tyre, Jerusalem, Ascalon, Tinnis, and Old
 Cairo {a family tree is provided in the note) .86 Such partnerships were
 natural since one or several members of a company were on travel
 while another collected and distributed the mail.
There remains the question why solely letters on the Asian route bore
 notes of the character described. By its very nature, this route was dif-
 ferent from the others represented in the Geniza. The route from
 Alexandria and other towns of Egypt to Cairo was comparatively easy
 and a great many fuyiij could engage in this occupation of carrying
 messages. The way to the cities of Asia led through the Sinai Desert
 and was far longer and more dangerous; here a regular service demanded
 a higher degree of organization. On the other hand, the couriers com-
 muting between Egypt and western North Africa or Spain depended
 on the caravan traffic, and their deliveries were of necessity far less
 frequent than those of the kutubiyyin of the East. Concomitant with
 these fact9rs was another and presumably decisive reason for this dif-
 ference. Although we do not know much about the imperial post in
 Fatimid times, it stands to reason that then, as under the Mamluks, the
 Asian route was the one on which the barid mainly operated. The com-
 mercial mail, I suppose, followed here as in other respects the model of
 the government post. The names of the forwarding and receiving (or
 carrying) clerks used to be written on the reverse side of the official
 mail conveyed between Cairo and its Asian dependencies, and this usage
 was imitated by the couriers transporting the correspondence of the
 population at large. Another peculiarity of this route: only with respect
 to the Syro-Palestinian coast do we hear of a fayj traveling in a boat







 (sailing from Tyre). He is described as insan yahud'i, a Jewish person,
 hut his name is not mentioned. 87


 4. RIVER TRAFFIC
Wherever available, inland waterways during the Middle Ages were
used as the main channel of transportation around the Mediterranean,
as in most parts of Europe. Of all the countries to the south and east of
the Mediterranean, only Egypt possessed a rich system of waterways,
and it is perhaps correcG to say that it.s economic ascendance over its
neighbors owed partly to this advantage.
The importance of river traffic for medieval Egypt is brought out
 first by the fact that so many different types of craft were employed
 in it. The most specific of these was the 'ushari, a Nile boat that was
owned by men of higher standing for their personal convenience but
also served as a commercial transport, for instance, for carrying bales
of flax from Bii~ir downstream to the capital. It had a small cabin,
mainly for the use of the captain, known as tarma at the time of
Maimonides and still called by that name today.1
The general Arabic term for ship, markab (see below), must also have
designated a special type of vessel, since it is differentiated in our
records from other craH; it is the word most commonly used, in this
context, ref erring to traffic on the Nile, as well as on the high seas.2
Barges of different sizes, called jarm (plural jurum) were used for
the transport of goods {and of those accompanying them). They had
sails, as in ancient Egypt, and, in good weather, could enter the sea.
This is reported by a French traveler of the sixteenth century and
confirmed for the eleventh century by a Geniza letter speaking of
twenty-one bales of flax reaching Tunisia in a jarm. 8 Nile barges regu-
larly sailed from Rosetta to Alexandria by sea! Their going aground
in the Nile and perishing together with the goods of the merchants is
also reported. 5
Galleys, propelled by oars, plied the river oYer the long distance from
Cairo to Qii~ in Upper Egypt. 6 Another type of Nile boat, possibly
introduced from Iraq, because it bears an Iraqian name, was the
sumaydyya. In one case we hear of two young merchants traveling on
such a vessel, together with their goods, down to Fuwwa on the western
arm of the Nile, where it was customary to leave the river and to con-
tinue on a canal leading to Alexandria-if the canal happened to have
enough water to arcommodate a ship. 1
Finally, mention must be made of the khfti. whirh, in frequency of
occurrence in our records, is second perhaps only to the markab. It,
too, is first mentioned in Iraq, where it designated both big ships
sailing as far as China and small skiffs rowed by one man. The word







 meant also "a tall, slender woman," and there is perhaps some connec-
 tion between the two meanings. It must have had a reputation for
 speed, as the following detail, mentioned in a letter from Alexandria,
 shows. A party of travelers from Sicily had missed their boat and tried
 to catch it in a khiti. The writer of the letter was so sure that they
 would succeed that he entrusted the passengers of the khJtj: with his
 overseas mail. 8 Occasionally, other craft are mentioned as operating on
 inland waterways in Egypt.9
In the Middle Ages, on account of the comparatively sma11 size of
 the vessels, there was no strict distinction between seagoing and river
 craft. Thus the Frisian ships, scheduled to take part in the Crusades
 in 1147 and 1187, set sail in Cologne on the Rhine, far from the sea. 10
 Similarly, Cairo was a great naval base, and the Muslim men-of-war set
 out from there on their expeditions. 11 It is, therefore, not surprising
 that occasionally we hear in the Geniza of ships coming from the sea
 and continuing their way on inland waters and vice versa. Thus a man
 coming from Tunisia and proceeding to Old Cairo writes from Alexan-
 dria that he was unable to leave the boat-obviously because he had to
 keep an eye on the goods carried with him, and also that he could not
 unload certain consignments, as asked by the addressee, because they
 were stowed away in an inaccessible section of the ship. All this makes
 sense only if we assume that the craft was on its way from Tunisia
 directly to Old Cairo with only a brief stopover in Alexandria. 12
Similarly, we read in a letter from Jerusalem to Old Cairo: "You
 mentioned in your letter that people traveled this year from Alexandria,
 but here they say that the ships of Ibn Abu 13 'Aqil set out from Old
 Cairo!' 14 Ibn Abii 'Aqil was a rich Muslim judge from Tyre, Lebanon,
 whose ships frequented the ports of the whole eastern Mediterranean
 during the middle of the eleventh century, and reference is often made
 to them in the Geniza records. According to the report from Jerusalem
 just quoted, they must have gone that year from a port on the Pales-
 tinian coast via Damietta or Tinnis and the eastern arm of the Nile to
 Old Cairo, and were expected to set out from there to Alexandria and
 the West via the western arm of the Nile. It is perhaps not superfluous
 to point out that in Arabic and medieval Hebrew the word for "sea"
 also designated the Nile: therefore, in order to express the notion that
 a ship passed from the Nile into the .Mediterranean, one said "it went
 out into the salty sea." 15
The overwhelming testimony of the Geniza records prows, however,
 that, as a rule, passengers and consignments left the seagoing vessels
 in the Mediterranean ports and continued their way inland by other
 means of transport. This state of affairs, established beyond doubt
 through countless references, may have had its reason in the fact that
 navigating on the Nile was comparatively dangerous and required
 much skill and experience. As late as 1836, E. W. Lane wrote: "In
 consequence of the continual changes which take place in the bed of







 the Nile, the most experienced pilot is liable frequently to run his
 vessel aground," and he also speaks about the sudden whirlwinds and
 frequent squalls, admonishing the traveler to exercise utmost precau-
 tion, however light the wind. 16 No wonder that we read in the Geniza
 papers so much on unpleasant experiences, while traveling on the Nile
 or about ships running aground. Expressions of extreme relief after
 arrival even from a short trip on the Nile are equally revealing, and so
 is a hasty note from Fustat, saying that the writer had seen a "trust-
 worthy" boat, known to him, mooring on the m~uth of the Khalij, and
 ready for the departure to Upper Egypt; if the addressee still had the
 intention to travel;he should take that boat immediately.17 The boats
 were likely of ten overcrowded and overloaded. Therefore, we hear
 rather frequently about goods that had fallen into the river, or, as if in
 surprise, that everything had arrived intact.1 s
A man who served persons belonging to the entourage of al-Malik
 al-Af<;lal, the actual ruler of Egypt during the years 1095-1121,
 writes this: " [After having passed the night in Qalyub near Cairo] I
 hired a donkey and its driver from Qalyiib to the neighborhood of
 Shattanawf up to the place where the royal riverboats anchored. We
 went down the Nile and stayed several days on the river, enduring
 great horrors on it. When we arrived at Maniif, the king [al-Malik
 al-Afgal], may God make his rule eternal, went on land and so did
 my lords so-and-so; I and X. remained in the boat." It is noteworthy
 that for the description of a short trip on the Nile, made with the king's
 retinue, the writer uses the expression italicized above, the like of
 which is not found often even with reference to the Indian Ocean.19 A
 contemporary of this man, a notable traveling from Cairo to Alexan-
 dria, also finds it necessary to write to his brother, after his arrival at
 the Fuwwa junction, that he had suffered much on the voyage. 20 About
 forty years later, the India trader f:Ialfon b. Nethanel, while sojourn-
 ing in Alexandria, rereh·es this notice from his brother: "I arrived in
 Cairo fifteen days after having taken leave from you. I endured great
 hardships and had to change from one boat to another, which was,
 however, a blessing; for if I had remained on the boat which I had
 boarded first, I would never have made it at all." 21 Another India
 trader writes to I;Ialfon: "I should like to tell you what happened to
 me on my way. The boat in which I traveled foundered [literally:
 broke asunder] opposite Shabiir [a locality on the western arm of the
 Nile J, but, thank God, nothing of my goods was lost." The casual way
 in which this occurrence is registered suggests that it was by no means
 exceptional. 22
The sufferings of the travelers on the overcrowded Nile boats are
 described in some detail in these passages selected at random. "After
 leaving you [in Fustat] I arrived in Minyat Siraj, where the captain
 threw me out. I returned to al-Maqs [the port of Cairo) and with
 great difficulty boarded another boat, on which I was several times







 on the brink of being drowned. But God let me arrive safely, after
 having been on my way for seven days." 23 This was written in Alexan-
 dria in December, 1214. Somewhat earlier, a scholarly person writes
 from Alexandria to his mother in Fustat: "I left you on Friday, but
 could not board the boat because of the customs officials. I arranged
 with the captain that he would moor where I would wait for him and
 take me on board. But when time ran out, I called a fishermen's ferry,
 paid them a dirhem and reached the boat. However, I did not find a
 place for me and was rather uncomfortable. We passed the Sabbath,
 then we moved [ driven by the wind] 24 for several days and arrived on
 Thursday late in the evening." 25
The long way upstream to Qu~ must have been particularly exacting.
 As we have seen (p. 290, above), it could take forty-five to fifty days.
 One letter describes how the boat made a halt of a full five days in
 the provincial capital Akhmim, where the passengers were forced to
 pay customs for the belongings carried with them, an unpleasant
 surprise, which also aroused the anger of the famous Muslim traveler
 Ibn Jubayr. 26 Outside the larger cities mooring was dangerous. "I suf-
 fered terribly because of the diseases of my fellow travelers and their
 disgusting odors. Things went so far that three of them died, and the
 last of chem remained on the boat for a day and a half until he be-
 came putrid." When we keep in mind that the Muslims used to bury
 their dead on the day they died, we understand that the captain could
 not dare to land because of the general insecurity on the shores. Our
 traveler was recompensed by the hospitality lavished on him in Qii~,
 a trait reported for this emporium of international trade also else-
 where.27 In contrast to the long halt in Akhmim we read in one letter
 that galleys arriving in Qu~ returned after a stay of only one or two
 days. 28
The waterway connecting the two main cities of Egypt, Cairo and
 Alexandria, had a serious disadvantage in that the canal leading from
 the latter town to the Nile did not have enough water for carrying ships
 during certain periods of the year. In a letter from Alexandria, dated
 October 23 (1140), a merchant warns his correspondent in Old Cairo
 that if he does not come quickly, the Khalij, or canal, would go out of
 use and his merchandise would get stuck in the Mediterranean port.20
 A similar warning is found, centuries earlier, in a Greek papyrus dated
 A.D. 710, where the Arab governor of Egypt makes a subordinate of-
 ficial responsible for any additional expenditure, in case the contribu-
 tions from his district would not arrive in time to be transported on the
 canal.3° It may be mentioned in passing that Queen Cleopatra was
 credited with the digging of that famous waterway and paving it with
 marble stones. 31 It had a checkered history and often must have been
 out of use, for we frequently read about heavy cargo having been sent
 from Alexandria by sea to Rosetta and from there on the Nile to
 Cairo.32







The voyage between Fustat and Alexandria took an average of five
 to six days according to the reports quoted thus far about the time
 actually needed for this trip by letters or passengers.83 A letter in
 Arabic characters, but addressed to a Jewish person, also states that
 the writer left on a Friday and arrived on Wednesday morning. 8~ In
 order not to take the risk of desecrating their Sabbath, Jews heading for
 Alexandria either boarded a Nile boat on Friday at latest-continuing
 one's travel in a ship on Saturday was of course permitted-or passed
 the Saturday in Qalyiib (about 12 miles north of Fustat) and set out
 early on Sunday on the main journey; for arriving on the holy day of
 rest was taboo. This strange custom of staying over Sabbath in Qalyiib
 is attested in three letters at least. 85
Ships sailing on the main artery of the country were sometimes ex-
 posed to attacks by bandits. After his safe arrival in Alexandria, a
 man writes to his mother in Old Cairo: ''We arrived safely, for God
 protected us from the bandits-a ship preceding us was taken by
 them." 86 A lively description of such an attack is contained in a
 letter from Qift in Upper Egypt. The boat had cast anchor overnight
 in the neighborhood of Dahriit, and everyone was asleep when the
 bandits attacked, hurling lances. The sailors and travelers fought back,
 and the writer of the letter, his father, and a scholar from Baghdad,
 who accompanied them, were wounded, but all took part in the fight,
 and finally the attackers were routed. 37 In a letter, in which reference
 is made to a rudder ordered by a notable, presumably for his Nile boat,
 an order of his for a sword is also mentioned.38 The insecurity on the
 banks of the Nile on the route to Qui? has been alluded to above -(p.
 298). None of the letters containing such details conveys the impression
 of having been written in times of particular unrest. The case is dif-
 ferent with this passage from a letter from Alexandria, which is
 preceded and followed by assurances that the writer, despite the
 urgency of the matters awaiting him in the capital, could not dare to
 undertake the journey at present. "No one can leave the city. Who
 does, either overland or by boat, is killed. Many have been killed
 while traveling on the Khalij." 39
Worst of all, the passenger was not even safe from possible assault
 by the crew, as the following extract from a complaint, submitted to
 the Fatimid caliph's chancellery, shows. When a young merchant and
 his partner carrying with them, in addition to goods, the very large
 sum of 500 gold pieces arrived at the Nile junction Fuwwa, the captain
 and the sailors of the boat in which they traveled murdered them and
 appropriated all their belongings. 40 We shall read about a similar oc-
 currence on a seagoing vessel.
Travel on the river ironically suffered not only from lawlessness,
 but also by too-close supervision of the government authorities. When
 there was any claim, real or fake, against one of the passengers, the
 qadi, or judge, ordered the ship back,41 or in the event that it had not







 yet departed, the person concerned was taken down from the boat and
 detained until he had settled his affairs with the relevant government
 office. Of course, he would then have great difficulty in catching the
 boat again. When one paid customs duties, not only the amount of the
 sum to be paid, but also the type of coin to be accepted and its exchange
 rate usually formed a point of controversy between traveler and gov-
 ernment officials. A prominent Tunisian merchant, who intended to
 travel from Old Cairo to Alexandria, had arranged to pay the customs
 duties for the goods of a friend entrusted to his care-or at least he
 believed that everything had been settled. He had hardly taken his
 seat in the boat headed for Alexandria, when five policemen arrested
 him and took him back to the office of the government accountant,
 where he had to make good a petty discrepancy in the assaying of the
 coins paid as customs duties. Meanwhile the ship had gone. He first
 took a boat to al-Maqs, the port of Cairo-the first stop after Old
 Cairo on the way north, but was likewise unsuccessful. The same hap-
 pened at the next stop. Only on Monday night, two days after he had
 first boarded the ship, did he catch up.42
Government supervision of river traffic was particularly harassing
 for non-Muslims. The poll tax incumbent on them was paid at a
 certain time every year, and no one was supposed to leave his town
 before having fulfi11ed this obligation. Many troubles resulted from
 this regulation for those concerned. The following account illustrates
 how it could affect a trip on the Nile. The passage is taken from the
 letter of a young man writing to his mother in Old Cairo, after his
 safe arrival in Alexandria.

As soon as I had settled down in the ship on Sunday morning, the day
of my departure, a policeman appeared for the poll tax. He saw me in the
ship and said to me: "Do you intend to depart and take along the poll
tax which belongs to the government? I shall not leave you until you
have come with me to the office." I had great trouble with him and im-
plored him very much to leave me; I would give him the fees due to him.41
Indeed, he did not leave me until I paid him two dirhems. I was sure,
however, that he would come back and prevent me from departing. There-
fore, I left the boat and went ahead, overtaking it at al-Rumayla, where
I boarded it again after its arrival. I learned indeed that my apprehen-
sions had been justified. After I had left, the policeman had appeared
again to arrest me. I can imagine what you felt when you came to the
boat and did not see me in it. I felt very sad about this.

The concluding remark is to be understood as follows: the writer had
boarded the ship at its port of embarkation, while the family lived some
distance from it downstream and were expected to bid him farewell
when the ship passed by."
Some cryptic remarks about the inadvisability of traveling on the
Nile might have something to do with its being too exposed to the







 vigilant eye of the government. "None of our friends are prepared to
 carry things overland; however, I learn that consignments sent on the
 Nile are not desirable." This statement is the more remarkable, as it
 was made to explain why the writer was unable to dispatch from Alex-
 andria to Old Cairo a present consisting of such innocent things as
 pistachios and cheese.45 A man writing from Tinnis in Lower Egypt
 states: "I arrived here riding on a donkey; for I am carrying silver
 with me and thought, therefore, that riding overland was preferable."
 In the otherwise completely Arabic text, the word "silver" is written in
 Aramaic, no doubt as a matter of precaution; it is likely that for silver
 brought into Alexandria-where the traveler concerned was proceed-
 ing-some tax was levied, just as was the case with gold, as we know
 from another Geniza paper. For this reason, it was perhaps advisable
 not to arrive in that town by boat, but on a donkey, as anyone coming
 from the immediate environment of the town would do.46 It may be,
 of course, that these and similar remarks to the same effect may have
 had other motivation than those assumed here.
Because of the close connection between seafaring and river traffic
 in those days, the organization and cost of transport on the Nile is
 discussed together with similar aspects of travel on the high seas.


 5. SEAFARING: ITS ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE

 The only news to be reported to your excellency is the arrival of two
Venetian ships with timber. However, I have not yet checked this matter,
for people, as you know, sometimes exaggerate and sometimes understate.
Others say that the Venetians have cancelled their passage altogether
and that only an empty ship carrying an ambassador will arrive from
them; others, again, deny this. In short, I am writing these lines before
having had the opportunity to mee~ the competent persons. A ship ar-
rived from Trapani [ wnich is situated] on the tip of the island of Sicily
-the same in which the proselyte Jew arrived a few days ago; however,
I have not yet spoken to any of its passengers. As soon as I shall have
exact details, I shall let your excellency know.1
 Among the ships which arrived recently was one from Marseilles, in
which an agent of the young R. Ephraim, who was here last year, had
traveled. He brought queries from a distant country, addressed to our
master Moses [Maimonides]-may his glory be enhanced-requesting his
legal opinion about them. I hired a special messenger for the conveyance
of these letters and ask your high excellency to deliver them.2
 All the ships going to Spain, al-Mahdiyya, Tripoli [Libya], Sicily, and
Byzantium have departed and have encountered a propitious wind. How-
ever, the ship of the ruler of al-Mahdiyya [which was on its way eastward
to Palestine] has not yet moved. Our master Judah ha-Levi [the famous
poet] boarded it four days ago, but the wind is not favorable for them.
May God grant them safety.3







 A day after the completion of this letter, a barge arrived from Alexandria,
which had been on its way for sixty-five days. Muslim merchants, who had
travel~d in it, told that they had left two ships behind them in that port,
which were about to set sail for Almeria. The newcomers had not met any
ships on their way which had set out from Spain, nor had they any informa-
tion about them.4

The first three passages translated above are found in letters from
 Alexandria; the first two were sent around 1200 to a representative of
 merchants of Old Cairo; the third was written on May 11, 1141, and
 addressed to a prominent person in the same city. The fourth quotation
 is from a letter which went from Spain to Morocco a few years before
 the date of the preceding letter. Similar passages, often far more
 detailed and technical, containing the names of the boats concerned
 and exact accounts about their movements, are found in many Geniza
 records, as will be seen presently.
The reason for this interest in sea traffic is easily understood: the
 local market and the prices of goods for import and export were entirely
 dependent on it. It was these ships that brought wares from abroad
 and carried the prospective buyers of goods produced locally or des-
 tined for reexport. A letter written in al-Mahdiyya on August 9, 1048,
 is very revealing in this respect. Two groups of three and six barges,
 respectively, had already arrived from Egypt, also "the boat of Ibn
 al-Iskandar," but "the ships," the main convoys, were still on the high
 seas. Therefore the writer felt himself unable to judge how the local
 market would behave, and to advise his correspondent in Old Cairo
 what to buy in that city. 5 Sometimes, one ship could change the whole
 situation. In a report from Mazara on the southwestern tip of Sicily,
 a major distribution center of the Mediterranean trade during the
 eleventh century, we read: "I was happy to have sold those four bales of
 flax, since the ship of the Binzerti [ family name, derived from Bizerta
 in Tunisia] arrived and· the prices fell. . . . What I had sold for 30
 quarter dinars is now worth only 26-7." In the same letter the writer
 states that after the termination of the seafaring season, the prices
 for lead rose-obviously because no additional supply was to be ex-
 pected.6 On the other hand, in a letter from the same port we learn that
 a hundred pounds of lead cost 8 quarter dinars during the winter, but
 14 after the arrival of the ships-with prospective buyers, of course.
 In nearby Palermo, Egyptian flax fetched 70 quarter dinars in winter,
 but only 40 at the end of the summer. In the writer's hometown, Sfax,
 a port in southern Tunisia, the same commodity cost 10 dinars during
 winter, when all the merchants invested their capital in olive oil,
 Tunisia's main export article. Then in May it reached the high price
 of 15-19 dinars, varying according to the quality traded, but went
 down to 8 "after the arrival of the ships." 1 When soap in al-Mahdiyya
 was so expensive "that only the government was able to buy it" (cf.
 p. 267, above), its price was reduced from 2-½ to 1-% dinars per







 qintar "after the sailing of the ships." 8 The unexpected coming of
 overseas visitors made for "prices like Hell" (namely, for prospective
 buyers), while sales in the time "before the arrival of the ships" were
 "a blessed transaction." 9 In a letter referring to Fustat the writer says
 that he had given instructions to put his goods, Tunisian textiles, on
 the market only after "the people," which means the Tunisian mer-
 chants, "had gone down," that is, traveled home to their native
 country.10
 The arrival of a single ship was able to make a stir even in a port
 the size of Alexandria, while an uncommonly quiet season in sea traffic
 put the whole local market out of gear. This is well brought out by
 the following passage from a letter from Alexandria, which was
 written around 1100. To appreciate its significance, one has to bear
 in mind that during the whole of the eleventh century Spanish silk
 was the type most commonly traded on the Egyptian market.

 As to silk: when the Spanish ship arrived, all business was at a standstill;
 no one bought or sold. Afterwards, small quantities were traded at the
 price of 21-22 [dinars] per 10 [pounds; a reasonable price, see p. 222].
 Later on, when no other ships came, there was a demand for silk, but
 · those who had it held back from selling; for during 33 days only one ship
 came and went; people became very much upset and confused, for there
 are only 23 days left until the Feast of the Cross [the term for the convoys
 to sail back to the West], but not a single ship has arrived from the
 West [i.e., Tunisia] and no news about ships has come through; in addi-
 tion, the winds are unfavorable, they are neither east nor west winds.
 This very day people have offered 23 dinars for [10 pounds of] coarse
 silk, but no one wanted to sell. Everyone is refraining from selling until
 the situation clears up.

 The same letter complains that no corals had arrived in Alexandria,
 either from Rum-which here designates Italy ancl its islands-or
 from the West. 11 Another letter from Alexandria describes a similar
 situation, albeit providing a different explanation. "The boat arriving
 from the West has not brought a single merchant, goods or a letter.
 We were told that the people [which means the merchants] are plan-
 ning to spend the winter in the West because of the bad prices. Should
 there be any news about the West and the arrival of people from
 there I shall write again." 12
When a convoy of foreign ships reached a harbor, some local mer-
 chants would try to monopolize all the imports and thus drive up the
 prices-a practice against which the ancient Muslim lawbooks were
 already fulminating, namely with regard to incoming caravans. "Meet-
 ing the caravans prior to their entrance to a city" was illegal. A late
 letter from Alexandria contains the following report: "Six Venetian
 ships have arrived with a great mass of precious goods. However, our
 coreligionists monopolized everything that came in them, thus pro-







viding exorbitant profits for the Rum [the Venetians] and doing
pernicious things never experienced before in the customs house." u
 Besides being carriers of passengers and goods, ships were substanLial
in the transmittance of mail. It is safe to say that at least half, if
not the majority, of the Geniza letters from North Africa and Spain
which we now hold in our hands were brought to Egypt in ships by
friends of the writers and not overland by professional couriers. This
fact is brought home by the many references to letters sent "in the
ships" or entrusted to persons mentioned as embarking. A considerable
number of letters bear express remarks to the effect that they were
carried as a favor and not for payment. In addition to the phrase
"deliver, and you will receive reward [from God]" (quoted p. 284,
above), which is also found on overseas letters, including those written
by persons from Spain,14 one used the formula "given as a trust,"
expressed in both Arabic and Hebrew (the latter based on Isa. 25:1).15
Sometimes, for instance, in a letter going from Alexandria to Palermo,
this was expanded to "deliver your trust and you will gain safety,"
the implication being that the traveler will be protected by God on
his passage in reward of his pious work of unselfishly doing a service to
others.16
 Reference has been made before to the custom of sending several
copies of a letter wjth friends traveling in different ships. Official and
business correspondence was simply copied, as is proved by extant
duplicates and triplicates. 17 Preserved examples of personal messages
show us that a man would write almost identical letters to various
members of his family, such as his parents and a sister, or a widowed
mother and his brothers, and if he happened to Jive in an island city,
would ask a friend to send, if possible, one letter in one ship and the
second in another. 18 We find also that two copies were entrusted to
one business friend traveling from the West to Egypt, one to be for-
warded from Alexandria and one to be retained by the carrier. As we
 remember, the way between Alexandria and Cairo was by no means
 safe at all times.19 Jewish merchants from overseas who had no ac-
 quaintances in Alexandria entrusted their letters to a Jewish postal
 agency which took care of their forwarding. During the second half
 of the eleventh century such an agency was operated by Ibrahim b.
 Faral;i (Ibn al-) Iskandarani. His name is provided here in order to
 save others the trouble of deciphering it, for his note: "forwarded by
 Ibrahim etc." is frequently found on letters dispatched originally from
 Sicily or Tunisia, and many letters written by him have also been
 preserved, but his handwriting is outrageous.20
 Before setting out from Egypt to Spain a relative of Nahray b.
 Nissim writes to him: "I am planning to travel to Spain this year.
 Please do not leave me without letters at any time." 21 This wish
 implies that N ahray would make use of the services both of the over-
 land couriers, namely during 'the winter when the sea was closed, and







of business friends commuting between Alexandria and Almeria or
Denia. It was this combination between the professional overland mail
and the opportunities provided by a lively maritime traffic which safe-
guarded steady communication between the Islamic countries of the
Mediterranean area.


6. TYPES OF VESSELS
 Just as we speak of a bus or train ride, so in Arabic and medieval
Hebrew traveling in a ship is described as riding, and the ship itself
is called markab, literally a riding vessel. In the Mediterranean, as
on the Nile, markab was both the general word for ship and the
designation of a special and most common type. Thus, in one letter,
"the Sevillian" (that is, the ship of the man from Seville, Spain) is
mentioned along with the same man's qiirib, or seagoing barge,1 while
in another letter the qarib of a shipowner from Haifa, Palestine, is
later on referred to as markab. 2 These seagoing barges, in Greek called
by the same name, karabos, must have been rather strong, for they
are frequently mentioned as covering long distances such as the route
from Tunisia to the Syro-Palestinian coast.3 They carried heavy loads.
According to one letter, a single merchant had in such a qarib 31 bales,
 which constitutes a weight of about 15,000 pounds. In another record,
 a merchant had 19 bales in a qarib, but only 2 in the ship, markab,
that it accompanied. 4 A qarib also carried passengers, normally mer-
 chants accompanying their own or their business friends' goods. They
 were used also by travelers other than merchants, as we can learn
 from the description of a journey from Palermo to Messina, Sicily,
 and other sources. 5
In a letter from al-Mahdiyya, written on August 9, 1052, the barges
 are described as "uncovered" and not protected against attacks from
 an enemy. The writer, therefore, refrained from entrusting to them his
 friend's cargo at a time that he characterized with the biblical phrase
 "outside, the sword deals death" (Deut. 32:25). 6 No doubt, these open
 boats were partly or entirely propelled by oars and, consequently,
 when the sea was calm, were quicker in reaching their destination than
 sailing vessels. Such cases are reported for both the East-West and the
 West-East routes. 7
In most records, these seagoing barges appear as independent trans•
 port vessels. In many cases, however-we had two above--they were
 attached to a larger ship. This relationship is expressed in various
 ways, sometimes rather awkwardly. Thus, one letter speaks about "the
 barge 'The Rose,' which is the 'ushari [ riverboat," see p. 295, above]
 of the ship that sails to Sicily." In another, a Hebrew letter, it is
 called "the maidservant" of the larger vessel. 8 This medieval Hebrew
 expression is reminiscent of the modern term service boat. The qaribs







 accompanying ships might have had just such a function. At arrival
 at a harbor lacking deepwater docks, the larger ships must have moored
 in a roadstead, while the service boats transported passengers and
 cargoes to the shore. (Middle-aged travelers of the Mediterranean will
 remember that this was common practice even in this century prior to
 the construction of modern ports everywhere. To be sure, in our time,
 the debarkation boats were provided by the local port authorities.) 9
Sometimes, "the small and the large ship fmarkab]" are mentioned
together, the "small" meaning the qarib. Besides its function as service
 boat, the q{trib was vital in other respects. As we shall presently see,
ships normally sailed in convoys. Thus this combination of a larger
and smaller craft going together-which in the Indian Ocean was an
even more constant feature than in the Mediterranean-arose from
considerations of nautical technique rather than for protection against
pirates. Under certain conditions of bad weather and rough seas, a
smaller craft had more chances of survival than a big one, especially
if the latter, as sometimes happened, had lost its sails or rudder. Thus
according to the Hebrew letter referred to above, the "maidservant"
boat picked up the few survivors of a main ship that sank on its way
from Tripoli, Libya, to Seville. So far, no reference has been found in
the Geniza records to lifeboats carried on a ship. 10
 Quite a number of special types of ships are mentioned in the Geniza
papers. The most common was the qunbar-certainly pronounced:
qumbiir, a word, it seems, not registered in any Arabic dictionary. The
Byzantine emperor Leon VI the Wise (886-912), in his book on the
Art of War, says, however, that the Greek equivalent of qunbar
kombarion, was derived from the Arabic word. His son, the emperor
Constantin VII (913-959), describes the kombarion as a particularly
large vessel. The Venetians, too, used this type of bottom, calling it
gombaria. According to the Geniza records, the qunbars operated all
over the eastern Mediterranean, carrying heavy cargo and passengers.
They never appear as men-of-war, in which capacity the Byzantines
had known them. 11
 These heavy crafts, we may safely assume, were sailing ships. Car-
goes and travelers were also transported in light galleys, propelled solely
or mainly by oars. They were called ghuriib, which word originally
perhaps was not understood as raven (the most common meaning
of the word in Arabic, for in the East raveos were as ominous as they
are in Europe), but as edge of a sword (the less-known connotation of
the word), berause of the galley's swift cutting of the waves. Accord-
ing to Ibn Mammati. an Egyptian historian writing around 1190, over
a century after the documents referred to here, a ghuriib was fitted
with 140 oars. The oar-propelled galley had both tactical and nautical
advantages over the sailing ships: as it could be turned with ease, it
had better prospects of escape from attacks by the ubiquitous pirates.
We read in one Geniza paper that a traveler was able to observe from







his ghuriib how pirates plundered a barge, qarib, in which he and his
friends had goods. Furthermore, the galley was less dependent on the
winds and cou]d more securely break through the coastal waves on
setting out or on returning-a particularly dangerous part of the
journey, of which more later. Still, the galley as merchantman is com-
paratively rare in our records, and, since during the whole periQd under
discussion, the eleventh and first half of the twelfth centuries, seafaring,
even along the coast, appears to have been entirely dependent on the
winds, it must have been mainly carried out in sailing ships. This
practice might have been economically motivated, for sailing ships of
middle size :probably required less manpower than galleys propelled
by oars and, with propitious winds, did better on the high seas.12
 A number of other types of boats mentioned in the Geniza papers
are discussed in note 13. Since Spanish Hebrew poets of that period,
in describing sea voyages, refer to both sails and oars, it might be
assumed that some of the unidentified types of boats appearing in our
records were, like the Italian tarida, a cross between sailing ship and
galley.13
 The Geniza provides us also with some information about warships
and naval warfare. Although the differentiation between merchant-
men and men-of-war was not as complete as in modern times, it existed,
as is proved by the different terms applied to each of the two groups
and the use of "ship of merchants" for the former, and "warship" for
the latter. Sometimes, however, it is expressly stated that goods were
sent "in the warship.'' 14
 The most characteristic feature of naval warfare as reflected in the
Geniza records is the tactical combination of heavy and light bottoms.
The former was called usful, which is derived from Greek stolos, "fleet,"
but designated in the Arabic of that period a heavy warship; the
latter is represented by the qata'i, or war galleys, which-most char-
acteristical1y-are invariably mentioned in the plural. Thus we read
in a letter from Alexandria, written at the beginning of the eleventh
century: "The ships, my lord, are making their last preparations for
their departure . . . they are only awaiting the completion and launeh-
i ng of the ustiil and its departure, whereupon they will sail together
with it. Tomorrow they will set the galleys afloat, for on this very day
 they have finished their repairs." 15 From another letter from Alexan-
dria, written at approximately the same time, we learn that the de-
 parture of the convoy to the West was delayed only because it had to
wait until the completion of the renairs of the ustiil.18 When in 1063
or 1064, the qa'id, or governor, of Sfax in southern Tunisia, revolted
 against the sultan of that country, a citizen of that town had the
following to report: "The ustiil rof the sultan l was moving from
al-Mahdiyya toward Sfax. We had already loaded six skins oi olive
oil and five of pitch, when we learned about the impending attack;
thus we left the rest of the goods behind. The ustiil arrived indeed and







captured our ship on the very day it had set sail; the galleys took it
to al-Mahdiyya, where it was unloaded and the sultan confiscated
everything belonging to the Sfaxians and the governor." 17 From Susa,
another town in Tunisia, which revolted against the sultan of al-
Mahdiyya at that time, we also hear about a successful action of the
latter's ustul. 18 On the other hand, when Alexandria was besieged by
Jabbara, a notorious pirate (seep. 327, below), by water and by land,
the job was done by galleys.19
 Occasionally we hear about the size of fleets actually employed in
war. The Almoravid qa'id, or commander, Ibn Maymiin raided "the
mainland" (probably of Italy) using 17 ships.20 A little later, in a
letter sent from Spain in spring, 1137, there is a reference to a flotilla
of 27 ships routed by the Muslims, and in the same letter apprehension
is expressed that "the enemy"-obviously the Genoese-would re-
appear in the following seafaring season with more newly built ships.21
In a letter from Sicily-then in Norman hands, written in the !all of
1156, "the enemy"-the Almohads-were reported to have assembled
40 galleys in Bougie, Algeria, and others in other· ports.22 More is said
later about a convoy of 22 merchantmen, each specified by name.
Under certain circumstances, merchant ships also fought back when
attacked. Thus we read (early twelfth century) about a Spanish ship
setting out from al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, defending itself successfully
against an attack (presumably of Italians) and gaining the port of
Sfax, after nightfall had separated the fighters. Another, North African
ship, sailing shortly afterward, was less fortunate. It was rammed by
the enemy and leH lying on its side, after he had succeeded-as the
letter emphasizes-in carrying off not only the light baggage and the
passengers (only 11 persons escaped), bu~ the heavy cargo as well.21
In the clamor and confusion of battle, people are inclined to over-
estimate the number of participants. This is well brought home in an
eyewitness report of 10 galleys attacking a flotilla of merchantmen.
The report adds: "But people say it was 200 galleys." 24
 As far as the origin and building of ships are concerned, up till now
only an indirect reference to the shipyard of Cairo has been found in
the Geniza records. 11 1Abd al-Salam, the supervisor of the construction
of the government ships" delivers an unspecified sum to a Jewish
banker, presumably paying back a loan. 2:. We hear also that the unew
Spanish ships" were eagerly bought by the merchants of Tunisia and
put into immediate use (middle of eleventh century) .26 In the letter
from Spain dated April, 1137, mentioned in the paragraph above, the
writer reports that a particularly large vessel had been built in that
country and that he hoped to travel in it from Spain home to Egypt
as soon as the sea was safe from enemy attack. It is not impossible
that this boat was identical with 11 the new ship of the sultan," that
arrived in Alexandria on September 8, 1140.21







7. THE ORGANIZATION OF SHIPPING
 The organization of shipping, as far as discernible in the Geniza
papers, differed widely from that found in other spheres of the inter-
national trade. While most of this was based on a ramified system of
partnerships, destined to minimize the risk of overseas undertakings,
a ship normally seems to have been owned by a single proprietor
and only exceptionally by two or more. There is little in the Geniza
which could be compared to the provisions for joint ownership in
ships so prominent in medieval European sea-contracts, or to the
loca, or shares in a boat) which dominate Genoese shipping at the end
of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries. The situa-
tion appeared rather as similar to that prevailing in Genoa at the end
of the thirteenth century, when the accumulation of great wealth and
power in the hands of the leading families made it possible to dispose
of the system of the loca. 1
 I have collected details about 148 boats plying the Mediterranean,
partly also the Nile, during the eleventh century, and only extremely
few instances of joint ownership in a ship could be ascertained. An
Ibn al-Iskandar (-Alexander) boat, called so after its captain, 'Ali,
son of Alexander, was owned by two partners.2 In the relevant letter,
a complaint about the partners, the boat was operating on the Nile,
but an lbn al-Iskandar is f.requently mentioned as commuting between
Egypt and Tunisia 9 and also as having along a barge bearing the
same name! A case of a "share" in a boat came before the Nagid of
the Jewish community of Egypt around 1100. The sums involved were
small, 15 and 27-½ 4 dinars. But these might have been due from a
final settlement and thus could not serve as an indication that a Nile
boat, and not a seagoing ship, was concerned.5 There is one definite
instance of a partnership in a maritime vessel, when in a letter from
al-Mahdiyya, written in 1048, the addressee is advised that a consign-
ment was shipped to him "in the barge of Ibn Akhi 'l-Wakil fthe
nephew of the agent], of which one half belongs to the elder Abu
'1-Faraj." 8 The latter is almost certainly identical with the Qayrawan-
ese merchant and notable Jacob b. Abraham b. 'Allan, whose byname
was Abu 'I-Faraj and who, like Nahray, settled in Egypt.7 There are
one or two other notes about boats which might be explained as refer-
ences to their being held in joint ownership. Otherwise the Geniza, so
rich in information about partnership in general, is reticent on this
point. Whether this was possibly because of the fact that the share
of the Jews in this economic activity was perhaps comparatively
modest, this question must be left to further research.
 The list of proprietors of seagoing vessels is headed by persons con-







nected with the government: the sultan himself, members of the royal
household, ladies included, governors (called qa'id in the West and
amir in the East), military commanders, viziers (called ~ii.jib in Spain),
and, last but not least, Muslim judges. The constant need for military
protection of all shipping explains, perhaps, why this lucrative business
was dominated to a large extent by those who were able to provide,
or easily obtain, this protection. We hear indeed of times when no
transport other than the sultan's ships was available (Tunisia, begin-
ning of eleventh century). One needed the personal intervention of a
notable with the sultan to get one's goods shipped to the East-and
for a very high price at that. 8
 The high personages owning boats are normally referred to by
their titles and not by their names. It is not always easy to identify
them. When we find in 1140 repeated reference to "the ship of the
sultan" sailing from Spain to Egypt together with "the ship of the
qa'id," it is reasonable to assume that the sultan Ya"tiya b. 'Aziz of
Bougie, Algeria, and the qa'id Maymfm of Almeria, Spain, are in-
tended, for these two similarly appear together in a treaty of peace
and friendship concluded with Pisa on July 2, 1133, and the ship of
the qa'id Ibn Maymiin is mentioned in a Geniza letter from Almeria,
written in the same decade as leaving that port.9 But a. hundred years
earlier, when a sultan's and qa'id's ships are mentioned either alone or
together on the route between Tunisia and the East, as is frequently
the case, they must have belonged to Mu'izz, the ruler of Tunisia,
and to the governor of Sfax, already referred to above, for the qi'id's
ship actually had that seaport as its Tunisian terminal. In one letter,
"the ship of the Sultan" is referred to also as the ship of al-Mu'izz.10
"The ship of the Illustrious Lady" is mentioned as accompanying the
ship of the sultan, namely, Mu'izz; thus it is probable that his aunt
and foster-mother Umm Malla.I or his sister Umm al-'Uluww is in-
tended. The latter was given an exorbitantly large dowry by her
brother, about which the historians have much to tell, and it is likely
that part of her great fortune was invested in shipping.11
 Of the many governors and military commanders referred to in the
Geniza as proprietors of ships, the most colorful was Na~ir al-Dawla
b. :ijamdan, who, during most of the years of terror 1062-1073, was
the actual ruler of Egypt. This Na~ir is described in our literary sources
as a high-handed and adventurous soldier. The Geniza shows us that
he was also able to appreciate the economic advantages of investment
in shipping.12 And so did his brother Fakhr al-' Arab ("the Pride of
the Bedouins") .is
 The Muslim qadi was not merely a judge and a religious authority,
but, in many cases) had far wider powers, which sometimes were equal
to those of a. ruler or governor. Under these circumstances, it is not
astonishing to find qadis often as proprietors even of several ships. In
particular, the qadis of Tyre and Tripoli, Lebanon, appear frequently







 as shipowners during the eleventh century. We may compare this state
 of affairs with the dominant role of the Patriarch, the head of the
 Church in Alexandria, in the economic life of that city in the century
 preceding the Arab conquest. 14
The largest single group of shipowners were the merchants. This
 applies in particular to the members of big business houses, such as
 "the great house" 'fansaw1, an Egyptian flax merchant, Sharyani, who
 was prominent in al-Mahdiyya, Tunisia, or Lakki (trader in lacquer),
 a family to which various shipowners belonged. The fact that a
 number of proprietors of ships are called traders in a certain com-
 modity, such as bananas, fish pickles, mace, odoriferous woods, pitch,
 or sal ammoniac, does not prove much, as these may simply be family
 names, just as others were called Mr. Potter, Mr. Saddler, and the like.
 In the case of about eighty shipowners who were neither connected
 with the government nor known by commercial activities, we may
 doubt whether they were merchants or skippers by calling. With regard
 to firms owning ships which figure in letters both from the beginning
 and the end of the eleventh century, however, it is perhaps correct to
 assume that they were mainly engaged in shipping.15
Considering that seafaring was regulated by the Christian {Coptic)
 calendar, one is somehow puzzled to find that the local Christians
 played only a negligible part in the shipping business. So far, only
 two proprietors of ships) who are expressly called Christians, have
 been found in the Geniza papers, although some other such persons,
such as the frequently mentioned al-Iskandar and his son, also might
 have been Christians. Four hundred years of naval wars between Islam
and the Byzantines probably had an adverse influence on the position
of local Christian shipping. 16
 As to the Jewish share 1n this important sphere of economic activity,
sporadic references to Jewish proprietors of ships (as well as to
Jewish sailors, see below) are found during the eleventh through the
thirteenth centuries-less in the Mediterranean than in the region of
the Indian Ocean. In addition, quite a number of Tunisian and Pales-
tinian shipowners bear names known from the Geniza as Jewish, such
as Ibn 'Allan, Ibn Yunus, Ibn Shiblun, or Mufaggal (of Haifa). All
these names also appear in the biographies of Muslim scholars, that
is, people belonging to the same class as that represented in the Cairo
Geniza. Therefore, pending further evidence, it cannot be ascertained
to which religious group those persons belonged. In any case, the Jewish
share in Mediterranean shipping during the eleventh and the sub-
sequent centuries was smaller than in early Islamic times. This change
was perhaps brought about less by Muslim competition and the Italian
ascendancy than by the ever-stricter interpretation and observation
of the precepts of the Jewish religion. As the desecration of the Sabbath
by sailors was unavoidable and, further, as their employers were re-
sponsible for all religious transgressions perpetrated in their service,







 shipping must have become less and less attractive for the scrupulous.17
Occasionally, we hear about the transfer of the ownership of cargo
 vessels. "He traveled in the barge that Zur'a, the agent of 'al-Jinani'
 [the name of another ship), had bought." 18 A particularly interesting
 case was the forced sale of a Tunisian ship, which made its way from
 Cairo to Alexandria in six days and was sold there for 300 dinars, the
 equivalent of 12 bales of flax. This happened, it seems, because there
 was some claim against its proprietor. The consignments of the trav-
 elers, including 4 bales of pepper belonging to the writer of the letter,
 were temporarily held in bail by the government. A Muslim passenger,
 known from other Geniza letters as a shipowner himself, filed a com-
 plaint, most characteristically with the qadi of Qayrawan and not
 that of Alexandria. 19 Mention has been made above (p. 308) of the
 Spanish ships bought eagerly by the merchants of al-Mahdiyya.
Ships were normally called by the names of their proprietors, some-
 times also by those of their captains. Thus one would say: "They
 arrived in 'lbn al-Basmali,'" or: "I sent in 'Mufarrij' and in 'lbn
 Na'im,'" or: "The consignment was taken down from 'lbn Khallaf'
 and loaded on 'Sa'ada,'" all these being proper or family names. 20 In
 addition, ships would sometimes bear individual bynames. These
 would refer, for example, to some characteristic decoration, such as
 "that with the rose," "that with the gold,'' the latter belonging to a
 sultan. 21 It seems also that ships called "the blessed," "the auspicious,"
 or "favored [by God]" were the property of rulers. We have already
 met such a usage with regard to the riverboats of al-Malik al-Af~al
 and shall find it again in connection with a warship. 22 Mostly, the
 names given to individual ships were derogatory or laudatory nick-
 names, expressing the travelers' experience with them, for example,
 "the washtub," "the spinning top," or "the bride" (a beautiful ship),
 a byname found both in the first and in the second part of the eleventh
 century, "butcher's knife" ( cutting the waves wonderfully?), or
 "Sirius" (the brightest star in the sky). Down to the end of the
 twelfth century, a similar situation with regard to the names of ships
 prevailed in Europe. 23
In many cases, the shipowners themselves dealt with customers and
made the necessary arrangements with them. In addition, every large
ship seems to have had a manager who served as agent as well as
purser. He made the agreements both with the merchants in general
and with each passenger indh·idually about the transport charges.
He decided the most crucial question in whi~h part of the hold each
consignment would be stored. and, since the major part of the freight
used to be paid after arrh·al, his permission was required for unload-
ing. A Hebrew letter describes him as "the treasurer and commander"
of the ship. 24
Ships belonging to rulers had an "overseer," who, in addition to his
substantial duties of agent and purser, had to spy on the passengers







and their cargoes. He was, therefore, a persona non grata in the mer-
chant community. One such overseer could be in charge of two ships
sailing from Egypt to Tunisia.25
 As to navigation personnel, it is interesting to note that on larger
boats, for instance, the sultan's ship sailing from Alexandria to
Almeria, Spain, there were two captains in command (their names are
given). This auxiliary captain may be compared with the vice-captain
in the Rhodian sea law.26 The mariners were called nufi (pl. nawa-
tiyya), a word coming from the same Latin or Greek term for ship
from which the English navy is derived. 27 Even sailors on Nile boats
were called thus. 28 Both captains and mariners received gratuities from
the passengers at embarkation and both were permitted to do business,
that is, to carry goods and to accept payment for this service. Thus
we read in a letter referring to a boat going from al-Mahdiyya,
Tunisia, to Alexandria: "The Jewish niiti will bring you a bag with
fourteen pounds of silk; please pay him one quarter dinar." In two
other letters, sent from Alexandria to Old Cairo, a sailor called Bunana
(it seems, also a Jew) carries up to 4 bales of Tunisian goods. Remarks
on navigation personnel as carriers or goods are particularly frequent
in reference to captains. The statutes of Venice and other Italian and
Dalmatian seaports presuppose a similar practice.29 .
 In deciding which ship to choose for a passage, passengers naturally
had to consider both charges and seaworthiness. The nicknames given
to ships show that the merchants were well aware of their qualities.
In one letter we read that a boat a merchant was warned not to use
actually foundered. The frequent refere nee to new ships in the Geniza
letters reminds one of the distinction in the legal situation between
new and old ships made in the Rhodian sea law.110


8. ON THE HIGH SEAS
 As in our own days, even a passenger not carrying merchandise had
to make arrangements with a ship's agent well in advance of his
journey. This was necessary even for the comparatively short crossing
from Alexandria to Palestine.1 For more extended journeys one tried
to secure a passage immediately after the arrival of the boat in which
one intended to travel. "The Riim ships have arrived," an Alexandrian
writes to his friend in Fustat, "if you plan to travel, let me know [ and
I shall book for you] ; if there is stm time, let me know as well." 2
The prospective traveler had to register in a list kept for this purpose
by the niiJir, or superintendent, of the port of embarkation.8 Merchants
who had to watch over their consignments must have boarded their
ships quite a while before departure. From two letters sent from
Alexandria it is evident that the writer, who had already "ascended" a
boat sailing to al-Mahdiyya, expected to receive from his correspond-







ent in Fustat instructions as to whether or not he should carry the
latter's merchandise with him. 4 Another merchant, writing from the
same port to the same destination, emphasized that ii was impossible
for him to leave the ship "lest something might happen" (presumably
to his consignments), wherefore he advised his friends to have certain
errands done by others. 5
 Everyone went on board at least a day before sailing. The night
before departure had a special name, "the overnight stay," a term used
on the Mediterranean as well as on the Indian Ocean. The night was
spent in prayer, in writing urgent letters (which we now read), or,
where feasible, in some last minute business. 6 When the wind was ad-
verse, the passengers were forced to spend several nights on board
before departure was possible. The poet Judah ha-Levi had already
been on the ship that was to take him to the Holy Land four days
when, on May 11, 1141, a friend reported from Alexandria that he
was still waiting for a propitious wind blowing from the west. A
beautiful poem, addressed to this desired wind, possibly the last from
the poet's pen, has been preserved, I assume because it was handed
over to one of the visitors who came to bid him farewell.1 Ha-Levi's
Muslim compatriot and younger contemporary Ibn Jubayr once had
to linger for a full twelve days until the ship in which he traveled could
raise anchor. 8
 Departure could be delayed for reasons other than the absence of a
propitious wind. Besides the menace of a hostile navy or of pirates
lurking nearby, there were economic considerations of the shipowners.
A boat, especially a bad one, sometimes was slow in collecting a suffi-
cient number of passengers and consignments and Jagged behind the
convoys to its port of destination. When the delay became too long,
an impatient traveler would leave the ship and entrust his consign-
ments to the captain or to other travelers. He would do so, of course,
only when he had other business in the port of embarkation, as we
read indeed in a letter reporting sueh an oceurrence.9 Occasionally,
tarrying too much could have disastrous consequences. A Tunisian
who had traveled to Palermo with the intention of proceeding from
there to Egypt, where he hoped to better his luck, had booked on a
qunbar of a man from Tinnis. The boat tarried until all the ships,
"even those with the destination Spain," which obviously were habitu-
aJly the last to leave the Sicilian port, had sailed. Fina Hy, during "the
overnight stay," the boat was sequestered, the consignments were car-
ried to the "sultan's palace" and the passengers became stranded for
the whole winter. "Thus, I remained in a foreign country without a
dinar or dirhem, with my hands and feet cut off fthat is, unable to
find work 1-" 10
 The enthusiastic description by a Chinese traveler of a thirteenth-
century Mediterranean ship, which carried thousands of people and
had stores for wine and victuals and even weaving looms, is not echoed







 in the Geniza letters, most of which, it is true, hail from the eleventh
 century. 11 They rarely speak about the number of passengers traveling
 in a boat. One ship, sailing from Palermo to Alexandria, carried "about
 400 people," another going direct from Tripoli, Libya, to Seville had
 on board "36 or 37 Jews and nearly 300 Muslims." The second of these
 reports was written around 1140; the first is even later.12 A letter from
 Alexandria describing the loss of three ships, carrying cargoes of a
 total value estimated at 200,000 dinars, specifies that IO Jews traveled
 in them with consignments worth 7,000 dinars. If we assume that the
 average value of the goods transported by non-Jewish merchants was
 about the same as that of the Jews, we would arrive at a total of
 approximately a hundred passengers per ship. 13 In another letter from
 Alexandria, written undoubtedly in the second half of the eleventh
 century, a Tunisian merchant has the following to report on the eve of
 the Jewish New Year's Day (falling mostly in September): "Until
 today, there arrived from the island of Sicily ten ships, each carrying
 about five hundred persons." The writer mentions each ship by name,
 and almost all of them are known to us by other Geniza letters of that
 period. The testimony of the writer, a seasoned businessman known
 from many documents, has to be taken at face value, for he writes
 here to his son conveying to him intelligence about the economic situa-
 tion in Alexandria. As has been pointed out above (p. 215), a certain
 adjustment might be recommendable in view of the predilection of the
 Geniza people for the number five. 14
In letters sent from boats operating on the Indian Ocean, we read
 about cabins or rather compartments, which were sometimes shared
 with business friends. Incidentally, the word designating them is
 Malayan. Thus far, nothing comparable to this has been found in
 Geniza papers describing journeys on the Mediterranean.15 One gets
 the impression that, in many cases, the passengers actually slept on
 top of the bales belonging or entrusted to them. "I intended to travel
 in it [in the 'blessed boat,' see p. 312, above] upon the consignment
 of my lord," remarks a merchant of good standing in an ancient letter
 written on vellum. "He let someone else [instead of himself] travel
 on top of his consignment and go to al-Mahdiyya with it," we read in a
 letter from Sicily from the second half of the eleventh century. Since
 one traveled by sea only in the summer, however, when there is little
 rainfall in the southern Mediterranean, the lack of cabins was per-
 haps not felt as such a great inconvenience as it would appear to us. 16
It is almost superfluous to record that the passenger had to provide
 his own mattresses, bedding, and household utensils, including, of
 course, his own cutlery. The loss of these personal effects in a ship-
 wreck was regarded as a disaster worthy of mention along with the
 loss of one's merchandise and money. 17 A prominent merchant from
 Palermo, who had forgotten his silver spoon in Old Cairo, asks the
 addressee in a letter written on his way home, and dispatched from







 Alexandria, to send it to him "next year," that is, during the next
 seafaring season. 18 In the "large boat" going from Tripoli to Seville
 mentioned above, the passengers were advised to bring their own mat-
 tresses and bedding-but were assured that they would feel as com-
 fortable as in their own home. 19
It is most remarkable that almost no references to the difficulties of
 provisioning during a voyage on sea are found in the Geniza. Water
 and food were brought on board as near departure time as possible.
 As stated in one letter, their arrival served as an indication that the
 boats were about to set sail. A mishap, such as a precipitated de-
 parture, could entail hardship as we read in another letter: "I lacked
 provisions because I was overtaken by our sudden departure. Not one
 loaf o[ bread went with me on board. A favorable wind started to blow
 at early dawn on Friday so that we found no time to bake or to prepare
 a thing before sailing"-and this on a voyage from Alexandria to
 Tunisia! From this description it appears that our traveler did not
 provide himself with the dried bread described by Maqrizi as the
 staple food of the Egyptian peasants.20 We surmised above (p. 121)
 that carobs (St. John's bread) might have constituted a substantial
 part of a seafarer's diet. The money spent on provisions is listed among
 the losses incurred when a ship had to return to its port of departure,
 and we hear also of a case where a ship, on the way from Tunisia to
 Alexandria, had to cast anchor because provisions had run short--
 most probably because of an unexpected delay-and a messenger was
 sent to buy food in a nearby town. 21 In Judah ha-Levi's poems there
 are repeated complaints that he suffered hunger on the sea, and in one
 humorous poem, dedicated to his travel companion, he emphasizes that
 he would have starved had it not been for the considerate foresight of
 the latter. 22 Except bread, though, neither accounts nor letters specify
 the nature and cost of the rations taken by a traveler with him on a
 sea voyage. The scarcity of references to this subject may partly owe
 to the fact that people were generally not fussy about food, and (unlike
 modern man) regarded it as vulgar to enlarge on it.23 Perhaps it reflects
also an actual situation, namely, that the Mediterranean seafarer did
not find unsurpassable the difficulties in providing for himself ade-
quately.
 As to the seasons of sailing, the sea was closed for almost half the
 year, throughout the whole winter. Even for the short voyage from
Jaffa or Ascalon to a port of Egypt one waited "until the time of the
opening of the sea." 24 "The sailing of the ships," which means the con-
clusion of the seafaring season, is often referred to. 25 On the other hand,
so far, not a single instance of a ship setting sail for the high seas
during the months of November through March has been found in the
Geniza papers. When the Fatimid governor of Acre, Palestine, Badr
al-J amali, urgently summoned by his caliph, set out in December,
1073, from that port to Tinnis, Egypt, a distance covered by him in







 four days, he was lauded as a particularly daring man. Sometimes,
 although very rarely, it occurred that ships, delayed by unfavorable
 winds, arrived during the winter. 26
Normally, ships set out in the ear1y spring. In a letter from Alex-
 andria, dated Nisan 24th (which usually corresponds to a day in
 April), the writer emphasizes that on that very day four ships had
 left for Tripoli, Libya, to be followed by another one.21 By Nisan 25th,
 all ships had left Ascalon, Palestine, in all directions, according to an
 eleventh-century report from that place. 28 The passage from a letter,
 dated May 11, 1141 {see p. 301, above), contains a similar statement
 concerning Alexandria. Sometimes the sailing had to be postponed.
 Thus we read in another letter from Alexandria, written by the same
 man but in a different year, that the ships going to al-Mahdiyya left
 only on the second day of the Copt,ic month of Baoonah (Pauni),
 which corresponds to our June 8.29 July and August were regarded as
 quiet and favorable for seafaring, especially for oar-propelled vessels.
 On August 9, 1062, a boat arrived in Alexandria from Mazara, Sicily,
 which had been on its way for seventeen days, and at the same time a
 report had already come through that all the ships heading for al-
 Mahdiyya had arrived safely.30
For the return journey in the fall, it seems that ships set out earlier
 in the western Mediterranean than in the eastern. In the latter, both
 in Egypt and on the Syro-Palestinian coast, the time was the Coptic
 Feast of the Cross, the 'Id al-eaub, which was celebrated on the 26th
 or 27th of September. Usually it is referred to shortly as ealib or rather
 (:,alibiyya, a word that also designates the winds blowing at that time. 31
 In the West, August was the end of the summer season for overseas
 business. The ships heading eastward normally sailed at about this
 time. Most of the letters sent by boat from Tunisia are dated between
 the loth of Ab and the 2oth of Elul, which coincides approximately
 with the end of July, August, and the beginning of September. 32
Correspondingly, the arrival in Egypt of autumn convoys from Spain,
 Italy, and Tunisia is usually reported for the end of August or slightly
 later. Thus we read in a letter from Alexandria, of August 28, 1140: "A
 Genoese ship has arrived, and it is said that it belongs to a ()Onvoy of
 twelve [literally: it is one of twelve]. However, the ship of the Sultan
 has not yet arrived and the people are worried." 33 This ship, which was
 coming from Spain, actually sailed into Alexandria on September 8,
 as we read in another letter from that town, which also reports that its
 sister ship, that of the qa'id, or commander, had arrived some days
 before.H A letter from the same port, dated Elul 10th (second half of
 August) , contains the following remark: "A barge arrived from al-
 Mahdiyya and [the people traveling in it] reported that all the ships
 were close behind." 38 Statements pointing to the same fact are found
 in other letters from Alexandria.36
During the winter, ships were dragged on land, and repairs made on







them. A report on five ships called by name and being fixed during
the winter in Alexandria was mentioned above (p. 215). Of one of
these ships it was stated that it was turned on its side for the repairs.37
It is said even of a heavy warship that the merchants waiting for the
completion of its repairs expected it to be pushed into the sea (so that
the convoy to be protected by it might be able to sail} .38 Whether any
structures comparable to a modern dry dock were used is not evident.
The two rudders attached to a ship, called its "legs," could serve to
keep it upright when it was pulled on land. This is evident from a
report on an attack by pirates on merchant ships that had taken refuge
in a harbor. Of one ship it is said that it was without yards and sails
and that its two "legs" were on its stern (instead of midship) so that
the attackers were unable to move it. Of two others, the following is
reported: "The 'legs' of the two ships were on the land which caused
that the enemy could not take them away." Illustrations in Arabic
manuscripts draw the rudders of a ship disproportionately large in
both length and breadth. Thus there was perhaps no need for a special
structure when the ships were under repair. Anyhow, in springtime
the sailing season was opened when "the ships were pushed into the
sea." 811-

 The predominance of the long- over the short-distance routes in in-
ternational trade is discussed above (pp. 211-213). A few words must
 be added here on this point with regard to seafaring. When a boat is
 described as having arrived, for example, in Alexandria from al-
 Mahdiyya, or Palermo, or Tyre, Lebanon, this means that it had made
that voyage directly and had not hopped along the coast from one
 anchorage to another. In some cases this is expressly stated, naturally
 only when special circumstances induced the writer to do so. Thus
 Nahray b. Nissim's cousin reports to him from Alexandria at a time
when only one ship had arrived from al-Mahdiyya and none from
 Tripoli or Sfax, and when he daily went to the seaboard looking out
 for arrivals from these ports: "This week, there arrived a Spanish ship
 from Spain, namely from Denia, in which a number of our friends
 traveled [four are called by name]. They did not enter al-Mahdiyya
 and have no newa about it. . . . There arrived ships from Genoa and
 other RUm places, and three other ships are expected from Spain." 40
 Around 1140 we find an Italian Jew writing that a certain large ship
 would make the distance from Tripoli, Libya, to Seville, with a favora-
 ble wind, in eight days and no land would be seen on that route. This
 tallies with a poem written by Judah ha-Levi on his voyage from Spain
 to Egypt in the same year, complaining that nowhere was land to be
 seen.41 When once, owing to enemy action, the ships heading for Tunisia
 were kept in the harbor of Alexandria, a merchant from al-Mahdiyya
 advised his representative in that harbor to repack the consignments
 in half-sized bales and to send them via Barga, Libya, that is, in
 smaller craft sailing along the coast.'2 When a ship was forced by some







emergency to call at an intermediate port, the letter referring to this
would supply an appropriate explanation.
 This predominance of direct long-distance routes, which is perhaps
at variance with our ideas of medieval seafaring, might have had
financial as well as nautical reasons. The merchants wanted to avoid
the delay and the additional cost-customs and so on-caused by
entering too many harbors on their way. In addition, at least for
Alexandria, we know that a particularly dangerous part of the voyage
was the moment when a ship tried either to enter the high seas or to
break through the coastal waves on its return. It was a common occur-
rence for ships to be on the brink of disaster or to founder in the very
propinquity of the lighthouse of Alexandria. This is known from pre-
Islamic times and reflected again in the Geniza. An important legal
document (dated 1143) deals with a foreign Jewish merchant "who
drowned in the sea near Alexandria," while his goods could be sal-
vaged.43 Two ships going to Sicily were forced to jettison about a hun-
dred bales of cargo talJ,t al-maniira, "just under the Pharos." Here
again the goods could be recovered from the sea, hut the advance paid
 for the freight was lost: once a ship had passed the lighthouse, seamen's
 law regarded it as having reached the open sea (early eleventh cen-
tury) .44 The wife and other relatives of the Tunisian historian Ibn
 Khaldiin, who were on their way from Tunis to Alexandria in order to
 join the head of the family who had emigrated to Egypt earlier, per-
 ished in the sea just outside the harbor (in 1384) .45 The danger incurred
 by ships while breaking through the coastal waves was present also in
 the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.
In order to minimize the danger from hostile nature and men, ships
 setting out for longer distances normally sailed in groups. Often, how-
 ever, these groups were split up by the very forces they had tried to
 defy. Therefore, we frequently read about ships arriving alone having
 left behind those in whose company they had set sail. Instances of both
 cases have been quoted above and more follow below.
The boats going from Alexandria to the West used to sail for a long
 time in sight of the African continent. All along the coast there were
 observation points, specified in many records, which would relay the
 positions of the ships to Alexandria, from where the representatives of
 the Cairene merchants would keep their business friends informed.
 Since the ships were mentioned by name in such letters, they must have
 been recognizable at some distance. Normally, such a report would
 conclude with the remark that the ships had passed out of sight and
 reached the high seas, or failed to do so. This "passing out of sight," or
 "crossing," ta'diya, as it was called, a very frequent term, is reported
 with a sense of relief rather than concern. The point of "crossing" was
 at least one day's sailing west of Tobruk. 46
Similarly, boats arriving from Spain or other countries of the West
 would be reported upon to Alexandria as soon as they were sighted at







 the observation points on the long North African coast of Egypt, and the
 Alexandrian merchants would relay this information to their friends
 in Cairo. This was done in particular when the ships were late because
 of adverse winds blowing from the east. In a letter written on the day
 after the Day of Atonement (which falls mostly in the second half of
 September) we read this: "No one has arrived yet from the West ex-
 cept the ship from Spain in which Makhliif b. Musa al-Nafusi 47
 traveled. Another ship from Spain is expected. From al-Mahdiyya no
 one has arrived up till now. As to the ships which have been sighted,
 letters have been received from our coreligionists [at the observation
 points] that they are doing well. They are now in Bandariyya waiting
 for deliverance by God [i.e., they had to cast anchor awaiting a change
 of the wind]. I pray to God that he might deliver them." 48 Occurrences
 like the one reported here were most common (see below, passim).
 Even on. the short stretch between Tinnis and Jaffa, after seven days
 of east wind, a boat had to moor in the intermediary port of Ascalon
 in order to avoid being driven out to the West.49
"A little worm on a splinter"-this is how, according to an Arabic
 saying and a verse in a Hebrew poem-an eleventh-century traveler
felt when he was out on the high seas in his frail craft.50 Of course,
most of the merchants whose letters are preserved in the Cairo Geniza
were seasoned travelers who were not very sentimental about the
 tribulations endured at sea. Thus in a letter sent from Alexandria to
Spain, the writer has this to say after his arrival from that country: "I
arrived in Alexandria safely, after having experienced trials and suffer-
ings, which would take too much time to describe. We almost perished,
but the Creator saved us in his mercy and lovingkindness." 51 Another
 merchant, after having completed the same journey, simply states:
"God decreed my safe arrival." 52 A trip along the Palestinian coast, as
we shall presently see, could sometimes be very rough. A scholar, wh(
had had such an unµleasant experience, writes to his friends in Egypt:
"On the sea, I endured great hardships, but God granted safety for
His name's sake." 53
 Sometimes, however, the Geniza letters are more specific with regard
to dangers or disasters incurred on the sea. The following account is
taken from the description of a voyage along the coast of Lebanon
and Palestine in late October or the beginning of November:
We set sail [in Tyre] for Jaffa, the port of Ramie. However, a wind arose
against us from the land. It became a storm and drove us out into the
midst of the sea, 1vhere we remained for four days, giving up all hope
for life. We were without sails and oars and the rudder was broken. Like-
wise, the sail yards were broken and the waves burst into the barge (qarib).
Realizing that our ship was a mere riverboat ('usharl), small as a ferry,
we cried: "Allah, Allah." We threw part of the cargo overboard and I gave
up all hope for my life and for all that which I carried with me. I vowed
one dinar from the proceeds of the textiles. Finally, through God's grace,







we reached Caesarea; however, both my clothes and goods were completely
soaked. I did not find a place to spread out my things to dry. So I took
domicile in the synagogue, where I stayed for five days.M

 The puny coastal crafts form the subject of another vivid descrip-
tion of trouble on sea.
This is to inform you that I arrived safely [in Tripoli on the Lebanese
coast] after a journey of eight days.... Water seeped into the ship and
I worked the pumps 55 from the very day we left Alexandria. Each man
had to bail fifty buckets of water in a shift, each bucket being the size
of half a Byzantine barrel. Our turn came two or three times during a
day and a night. Abu 'I-Faraj b. Joseph, the Spaniard, also took his turn.
Thank God, we arrived safely, but a great quantity of linen got wet, and
the merchants quarreled with the owner of the boat until he remitted a
part of the fare. My own linen became only slightly damaged by water,
about fifty pounds out of a total of two bales, really a negligible quantity. 58
 The foundering of a large ship on its way from Sicily to Alexandria
with 400 passengers on board (cf. p. 315, above) is described at great
length in a Hebrew letter. After a storm, which lasted three days, the
ship began to draw water and the sea burst into it from all sides. AU
efforts to keep it afloat by pumping and throwing part of the cargo
overboard were of no avail. The passengers entreated the captain to
turn toward the mainland, which the latter was apparently reluctant
to do. As soon as the ship touched ground, it cracked asunder, "just as
one breaks an egg with one's hands. 11 The passengers were let down
"one above the other," but many of them were overcome and covered
by the debris of the ship. The writer of the letter and his two travel
companions, who had remained on the wreck, were advised to leave it
quickly and to save themselves by grasping a piece of wood. The letter
does not indicate how many lives were lost. On a ship en route from
Tripoli, Libya, to Seville, less than one out of ten were saved. In an-
other case, when three ships in a convoy of five foundered, and all the
cargo, including the light baggage, was lost, only one of a company of
ten passengers known to the reporter of the shipwreck died. This
disaster is described as exceptional and the like of it is not often found
elsewhere. Normally we hear of one or two ships lost out of a larger
convoy. 57 In the memorial Jists commemorating the ancestors and other
defunct relatives of a donator, the remark "taken away in his youth"
is common, but the notation "drowned in the sea" is rare.58
 Considering the great frequency of references to seafaring in our
records and the relative paucity of reports about shipwrecks, one is
inclined to believe that the medieval crafts were not altogether un-
suitable for their task. On the other hand, it should be noted that
remarks such as "al1 ships have arrived safely" are also no& very fre-
quent.59
 Under special circumstances and with bad luck, disaster could strike







even on a very short passage such as that from al-Mahdiyya to
Palermo. A respectable merchant from Tunisia, on the way from his
native country to Egypt via Sicily, had this experience:
 On my travel to Sicily I was overcome by events the like of which I have
 never witnessed. A great storm seized us on the sea and we were forced to
 land on an island called al-Ghumur.60 We stayed there for twenty days
 with no food other than nettles. When we set out from there we did not
 have any more the look of human beings. The seas tormented us for
 thirty-five days 61 and we were regarded .as lost. For we sailed in four
 barges ( qarib), but only ours survived. After arrival in Sicily we were so
 exhausted from our sufferings on sea that we were unable to eat bread or
 to understand what was said to us for a full month.

 The writer concludes that in view of the state of his health and that of
 his family he saw no possibility of continuing his journey to Egypt
 that year, as planned. 62
The report of another Tunisian about misfortunes on sea deserves to
 be presented here because it intended to comprise all the ships that left
 al-Mahdiyya for Egypt during one season.
 For your information: Seafaring was scanty this year, both outgoing and
 incoming. Outgoing from here: 14 ships took cargo; 4 of them returned
 to Sicily [that is, Palermo], namely, two belonging to Ibn Jarwa ["the
 little bitch"], 63 the barge (qii.rib) of the son of the Master of the Market 81
 and the Nile barge (jarm). The ship of the Physician entered the harbor
 of Tripoli [Libya]. Two ships foundered, namely that of Abu Sa'id and
 that of the Squint-eyed. The boat ('ushari) of the former came out [of
 the sea] 65 with ten persons who reported: we left the ship while it was
 sinking, but other people say: nothing of the kind. All those who had
 shipments in it listen to what people say. Concerning the ship of the
 Squint-eyed we were without news for two months after it had set sail
 from here and assumed that it had reached Alexandria. Then, one night,
 when coming into the vicinity of Salqata,66 it was thrown against the land
 and broke up. About twenty souls, women 67 and men, perished in it.
 Abu Ya 'qub Ibn Shama arrived here and explained that the place where
 they foundered was wild, and the rocks crushed the ship. This was a great
 disaster for many people, for large consignments went down with it. May
 God recompense fully and quickly those who suffered losses. About the
 rest of the ships we have no information, thus far. May God decree
 safety for them.

 Thus, in that particular year, at least 7 out of 14 ships setting sail in al-
 Mahdiyya did not reach their destination Alexandria.88
 There were disasters other than shipwrecks which entailed great
 losses to the persons hit by them. Often we read that on account of bad
 weather ships had to return to the port of departure. "We set sail and
 I stayed at sea for fifteen days, despairing of my life, then we returned
 to the Pharos. 11 811 After the conclusion of ~he seafaring season once a







single ship arrived in al-Mahdiyya carrying the message that all other
ships that had set sail from Alexandria for Tunisia had been forced
to turn back. 70 A rumor to the same effect had reached Tunisia in
another year.n Even from the Syro-Palcstinian coast, ships sometimes
were unable to break through to Alexandria and had to go back as
far north as Tripoli. 72 Such a return was often catastrophic for the
merchant concerned, for he thus missed a whole business season. In
addition, the customs paid were not returned; nor were the fares--or
rather, the parts of the fares paid before the journey. Also, the costly
provisions were either used up or spoiled. 73
Even worse was the similar and equally frequent case of ships being
compelled by adverse winds or other weather conditions to call at a
harbor other than their destination-an unpleasant experience not
unknown to modern man, as far as air travel is concerned. We had
five such cases in the report from al-Mahdiyya just quoted. \Ve read
of boats which were forced to anchor in Tarsus, Asia Minor, instead of
 Cyprus; in Tripoli, Libya, instead of Sicily; in al-Mahdiyya instead
of Tripoli; in Tunisia instead of Egypt (coming from Sicily) , and so
 forth. The ship bringing the tidings· of the case mentioned last had
 itself been driven to the Tunisian coast, but managed to change course
 and arrived in Alexandria before all the other ships from Palermo, al-
 Mahdiyya, and Tripoli. 74 Such mishaps even occurred to ships sailing
 around the Nile Delta, as when a boat on its way from Alexandria to
 nearby Rosetta had to seek refuge in the bay of Abukir. 75 Even when a
 ship was not driven to a hostile coast, such a change frequently meant
 a great loss for the travelers, for, as our records explain, merchandise
 that had a good market in the port of destination could not be sold at
 all in the place at which the ship had been cast up by chance.
During a heavy storm, medieval sailors took recourse to the costly
 expedient of jettisoning, familiar to readers of the Bible from the book
 of Jonah 1:5. The practice was so common that a traveler, when con-
 gratulated on his safe arrival, would be asked whether any part of the
 cargo had been thrown overboard. In a moving appeal to a congrega-
 tion written in Hebrew on a piece of vellum, a Jerusalem pilgrim from
 Europe reports that he lost all his belongings by jettisoning. 76 A ship
 whose name is repeatedly mentioned in the Geniza record on one
 occasion jettisoned a hundred bales, two of which belonged to the
 writer of the letter mentioning the incident (and devoting to it not
 more than one out of eighty-four lines) .77
No wonder, then, that people tried to protect themselves against the
 vagaries of a stormy sea by magical means. Formulas designed to effect
this have been found in the Cairo Geniza, and, as was to be expected,
 they do not differ very much from those found in Muslim literary or
 documentary sources. For superstition transcends the boundaries of
 religious communities. An instruction, written in an eleventh-century







 scholarly hand, contains "holy names," to be inscribed on a new
 earthen vessel, which, when thrown into the sea, would calm its stormy
 waters. 78 The figure of the master of the "holy names" must have been
 familiar to the seafarers of those days 1 for it was immortalized in the
 maqiimas of the Persian-Arabic poet Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadhani
(d. 1007) and his Spanish Hebrew imitator Judah al-I;Iarizi (around
 1215). Maga.ma is a literary form comparable to the modern short
 story, but unlike the latter, it is written in rhymed prose in an elabo-
 rate, witty style, full of allusions and, as a rule, has as its hero an
 itinerant litterateur, who succeeds in extracting money from people
under the most fantastic pretexts. Al-ij:ari:zi's 38th maqama-strongly
 reminiscent of Hamadhani's 23rd, called "The Amulet"-describes
 most beautifully a storm on the sea and the wild despair of all the
 passengers, except one. When the storm quieted down without having
 done harm to anyone, the man who had remained calm all the time
 was pressed by the others to explain his strange behavior. With great
 solemnity, he confided to them that he had nothing to fear, possessing,
 as he did, a "medicine book," containing magic formulas for all situa-
tions in life, including danger from "the angels of the sea"; he was
prepared to sell "holy names," for a piece of gold apiece, and before
the voyage was over, he had made a handsome sum of money. An old
acquaintance, who recognized him, understood that all this was sheer
 humbug, but refrained from exposing him. These maqamas show that
not everyone was prepared to rely on magic, despite its seemingly
widespread use, for safety on the seas. 79
Some data have been given in passing on the speed under sail of
medieval ships and the duration of voyages, and more are to be found
in the Geniza records. For the convenience of the reader, the data
collected thus far are arranged in a table at the end of this section. 80
We may assume that, as a rule, the number of days passed on the sea
was indicated only when there was a special reason for doing so. The
journey of 13 days from Palermo or al-Mahdiyya to Alexandria was
fast (no. 8) and that of 17 was good (no. 7), while one of 25 days
included a stop at Tobruk (no. 10). A passage of 35 days was ex-
cessively slow and is therefore mentioned, albeit without comment
 (no. 9) ; tarrying 50 days between Sicily and Egypt was absolutely
exceptional and is explained by particularly atrocious weather condi-
tions (no. 5). The student of Arabic literature is reminded of Ibn
Khaldiin's trip from Tunis to Alexandria in 1382 which lasted 45 days. 81
The normal conditions may be learned from our number 11: a mer-
chant in al-Mahdiyya sending a shipment to Cairo by boat expected
that it would arrive at its destination not later than one month after
its dispatch. Since the voyage from Alexandria to Cairo took approx-
imately 5 days and the shifting of the cargo from a seagoing to a Nile
boat also involved some delay, an average of 20 days must have been
the maximum of time normally expected to be spent by a traveler on







 the sea route between Tunisia or Sicily and Egypt. This tallies with
 the 25 days reported for the voyage from Marseilles to Alexandria,
 which seems to have been regarded as good speed. The number was
 provided because of the importance of the news brought by the
passengers (no. 2). The data about short distances are all combined
 with reports about specific hardships and are therefore of limited value.
 That a leaking ship could make the way from Alexandria to Tripoli,
 Lebanon, or Ladhiqiyya, in 8 days (no. 19) is quite an achievement.
The details on sailing speed preserved in the Geniza will have to be
 studied in connection with those mentioned in Arabic and contempo-
 rary European writings and even those known from late antiquity. For
 the technique of sailing did not change much during the Middle Ages
 until the fifteenth century, when a revolution in rigging took place.82
 The notice preserved in a Hebrew letter that a ship would reach Seville
 in 8 days, when sailing from Tripoli, Libya, not in sight of the land
(no. 15), is paralleled by a statement of the Muslim geographer al-Ya'-
 qiibi that the trip from Tunis to Spain would require 10 days sailing
 along the coast of North Africa and then an additional day for crossing
 over to the mainland of Europe. 83 There is, however, no point in com-
 paring the 65 days needed by a boat, sha!Jtura, for the journey from
 Alexandria to Almeria (no. 1) with Ibn Jubayr's voyage from Ceuta,
 Morocco, to Alexandria on a Genoese vessel, which required only 30
 days. Moreover, he was kept moored for some time by a storm at the
 island of Sardinia, from where he needed only 12 days to finally reach
 Egypt.84 Our numbers 1 and 4 seem to imply that under certain condi-
 tions, a smaller craft could do better than a regular sailing ship. But
 with normal weather, it could certainly not compete with a big vessel.
 Anyhow the data provided here will have to be scrutinized by experts
 in maritime history.

9. PIRACY, WAR, A~ OTHER MAN-MADE DANGERS
 Eva, more than the whims of nature, the greed and cruelty of men
form€& a constant menace to the medieval seafarer. First and foremost
was piracy. Much material from the Geniza about this subject has
already been published, especially letters in the Hebrew language en-
tirely devoted to it; much more, however, in particular the many short
but precise and precious references in Arabic letters, still await publi-
cation.1
 On the one hand, piracy was part and parcel of the Holy War against
Christendom. For this reason, we read so much about captives from
Rum brought to Alexandria or Ramle, Palestine, or other places, where
they were ransomed, or, contrariwise, about Muslim merchantmen at-
tacked by Italian or other European freebooters and Jewish captives
from Egypt ransomed in Constantinople. On the other hand, by the
eleventh century, Muslim pirates had taken advantage of the various
schisms that divided the Islamic world, and, in the end, Muslim ship-
ping itself became their easy prey. Eastern Libya, the land between
Barqa and Tobruk, seems t.o have become their base, just as Barbary,
western North Africa, played a similar role in later centuries. It is
perhaps for this reason that the "passing out" into the open sea of
ships heading for the West is reported with so much relief in many a
Geniza letter (see p. 319, above). "Those muslim pirate freebooters,
who had been the advance guard or Muslim naval strength," 2 became
the scourge of their own people. It seems that the Fatimid rulers of
Egypt used the pirates of Barqa for chast.ising the Sunnite West in the
same way in which they employed the Bedouin hordes of the Hila} and
Sulaym, namely, to destroy a country whose prosperity was a thorn
in their sides. Jabbara, the amir of Barqa, could openly receive pay-
ments from his victims in Gizeh, a suburb of Cairo, as we read in this
passage from a letter from Fustat;
 The merchants who had gone to Barqa have arrived here, stripped of
 everything. They had to leave their bundles behind until they would pay
 money here in Old Cairo. On the very day of their arrival, they collected
 one-thousand and three-hundred dinars, which they paid in Gizeh to Jab-
 biira's representative. The latter is about to return to Diyiir (or Abyar)
 Qays, where he will fetch their bundles and transport them to Gizeh. [Notice
 that the writer was unable to find out whether the addressee's or his own
 consignments were among the merchandise brought to Diyar Qays.] I
 )earned that Jabbiira emptied the ship [i.e., the hea"y t'argo that was not
 brought to Diyiir Qa~-s], put everything into his own boat and sailed for
 Alexandria. I hope this will be the case. When it arrives, kindly be present
 during the unloading; if our consignments are in the boat, ransom them
 with any sum possible.3







Together with Jabbara, the amir of Barqa, his father Mukhtar, and
 his relative Yabqa, as well as a number of other "Arabs," that is,
 pirates of Bedouin origin, appear in the Geniza records of the earlier
 part of the eleventh century. In documents dated 1027, 1028, 1031, and
 others coming from the same period, they were acLive in raiding
 Byzantine ships. From the numbers of Jews brought to Alexandria on
such occasions-eighteen, twelve, "many," respectively, one may con-
 clude how large the number of Christians thus affected must have been.
 Later on, we hear only about Jabbara's attacks on Tunisian merchant-
men. This might be mere chance. It stands to reason, however, that the
crushing victories of the Byzantine navy over the Muslims of Sicily
 and Africa in the thirties and forties of the eleventh century dis-
couraged the Barqan pirates, while the Fatimids gave them new ob-
jectives for their raids. In 1051-1052, Jabbara changed sides, burned
the pulpits from which prayers had been said for his former overlords,
 and acknowledged the suzerainty of Mu'izz b. Ba.dis, the ruler of
Tunisia. 4 Soon we find a report in a Geniza letter showing that J abb ara
laid siege to Alexandria by land and by sea (see p. 308, above).
 As becomes a freebooter, Jabbara served also as a protector against
other pirates, levying a heavy tribute, called ghifiira, on travelers in
times of danger, and he also engaged in mercantile shipping, carrying
goods from Barqa to Tunisia (in 1039) .6 The great variety of roles
played by one man-protagonist of the Holy War, plunderer of Mus-
lims, protector against other pirates, commercial skipper, Fatimid,
anti-Fatimid-seems very bewildering, but has its parallels in other
places and times. From the bynames of other pirates, such as Mahdi,
called the horse-trainer, it appears that persons from very different
walks of life chose piracy as their vocation.6
 While literary sources occasionally make allusions to the activities
of pirates, they are almost completely silent about a subject that mat-
tered most for the bulk of the population: the fate of the travelers
affected by it. The copious reports from the Cairo Geniza fill this
gap.
 First of all, a person captured by a pirate lost his freedom. He was
sold on the slave market, or whenever the circumstances allowed, he
would be offered for ransom, as this was expected to bring a higher
sum. In addition, he lost his merchandise, the goods entrusted to him,
all his personal belongings, his money, even his clothes; he was literally
stripped of everything. Moreover, he had to endure hunger, beatings,
and all kinds of torture. These appear in most reports. The pirates may
have been partly motivated by general human sadism-about which
we have learned so much in our own century; however, they also had a
practical aim: to induce the victim, as well as those interested in him-
as a rule, his coreligionists, for his family was far away in his home-
land-to get as much ransom money as possible in the shortest possible
time.1 In the case of women, girls, and boys, the additional threat of







violation was present. A certain protection for females and boys was
provided by the prospect that a higher ransom would be obtained, if
there had been no prior sexual abuse. The trick of extorting money by
the threat of violation was so widespread and old that there existed a
Talmudic rule that no person should be ransomed with a sum higher
than usual, since such a practice would impose an unbearable burden
on the community. 8
 Nothing is more characteristic of the relation of the medieval state
to its subjects than the fact that the ransoming of captives was not
undertaken by it, but left to the religious community to which the
victims belonged. How this great deed of charity was organized is dis-
cussed in A Mediterranean Society, Volume II, chapter v .9 The
standard ransom money for a Muslim, Christian, and Jew alike was
33-½ dinars per person, that is, 100 dinars for three. This is known
from literary sources and echoed in many a Geniza letter. Of course,
there were exceptions to the rule. Thus we read about a woman who
was ransomed for 24 dinars. 10 Or, a pirate would send one of his
prisoners as a "present" to a Jewish notable, whereupon the latter had
to reciprocate with a giH equal to one and a half of the regular ransom
price. 11 In the case of distinguished prisoners, middlemen would buy
them for a high price, in order to extort an even higher ransom from
 their families or coreligionists. A letter referring to such an occurrence
 mentions sums of 40, 50, 70, 87, and 100 gold pieces (last third of
eleventh century) .12 In a document from Alexandria from 1180 a cap-
 tive for whom 60 dinars had already been paid was not freed until the
 full sum of 100 dinars stipulated for his liberation was delivered. 13
Merchants of different race and creed knew well that they all were
in the same boat and tried therefore, where circumstances allowed, to
alleviate the lot of fellow merchants who had been taken captive. A
 particularly interesting case is reported in a letter from Alexandria,
which was published long ago, but whose real implications have not
been recognized so far, because the editor mistook mlf (which means
Amalfi, a flourishing maritime city in southern Italy) for mlk (king).
Merchants from Amalfi-of course, Christians-brought to the Jewish
community of Alexandria three captives who had been taken from a
ship, robbed of everything, beaten and almost kiJled, by Rum, Byzan-
tines or Italians. The Amalfians asked the community to deal merci-
 fully with these unhappy people, as they themselves had done, and
declared that they were prepared to sell them for the same price they
 claimed to have paid themselves, namely, two for 18 dinars each and
 one for 16. The sums indicate that these captives had been sold on the
 slave market. At the end, they were content with two for 16 and one for
12 dinars respectively.u
When a person prominent in public life was captured, the procedure
of redeeming him was of a more diplomatic nature. "I have written to
the Nagid-may he live for ever-and asked him to request the com-







 mander of the auspicious [i.e., royal] warship [or: the fleet] to rescue
 the Gaon and his children in Tripoli when he happens to anchor there."
 This we read in a letter to a notable who is also admonished to remind
 the extremely busy Head of the Jewish community (who was court
 physician to the ruler of Egypt) to attend to this matter. As head of
 the academy, the Gaon was a high religious dignitary and thus regarded
 as belonging to the caliph's entourage. A person of such description
 when captured by one of the petty rulers of the Muslim maritime cities
 would be freed at the request of the authorities, in particular if such a
 request was underlined by the presence of a warship.15
As intimated, no clear-cut distinction between piracy and war can
 be made in the period under discussion. Therefore, one is often at loss
 to decide which of the two is intended. Thus, when we read about
 African and Spanish merchantmen attacked by "the enemy" off the
 Tunisian coast, one is in doubt whether freebooters are meant or the
 navy of some Italian maritime town.16 One Geniza letter describes how
 the raiders of Ibn Thumna, a Muslim condottiere in service of the
 Normans, while on the way to Girgenti, Sicily, attacked a Tunisian
 ship, taking all the textiles carried in it, but leaving the olive oil, most
 probably too bulky a load for ships on a military expedition. 17 A little
 later, a boat on its way from Mazara, Sicily, to Egypt, after having
 met "the enemy," had to take refuge in the nearby harbor of Sciacca
 and had to unload there, because conditions at sea made any further
 voyage impossible. The letter reporting that incident and mentioning
 also in general "the burning of the ships" was written in 1063 or 1064;
 as the ~orrnan conquest of Sicily was in full swing at that time, "the
 enemy 11 referred to probably were Normans.18
A lively description of an attack on a convoy of merchantmen is
 contained in the letter of an Alexandrian merchant who was on his way
 to Sicily. The convoy-four ships are mentioned by name-had sought
 shelter in a harbor, it seems for a prolonged period, for a number of
 passengers-the writer included-stayed overnight in town, and not, as
 usual, on board. Some boats had their twin rudders stuck into the
 ground (see above, p. 318), and no attack was expected. Suddenly, at
nighttime, ten galleys appeared, each manned with a hundred warriors,
some of whom disembarked. The attackers tried to pull the ships away
or to set them on fire, but succeeded only in plundering one ship, which
they finally had to give up, leaving it stranded on the rocks. The wind
was against them and also was not strong enough to kindle the fire-
brands, which were extinguished by the crews and passengers, the
writer included, working in shifts. The losses listed in another part of
the letter give the impression of having been incurred not only that
night, but also on another occasion, perhaps a previous encounter with
the enemy. 111
In war, even civil war, goods belonging to the civilian population
of the opponent were forfeited when captured. We read above that the







sultan of Tunisia confiscated all the merchandise belonging to the
inhabitants of a town whose governor had disavowed his allegiance to
him. 20 War had other surprises in store for the seafarer; when, in 1201,
the ruler of Tripoli, Libya, was about to invade Tunisia, he forced the
sailors of all the ships anchoring in his port to man his own warships,
and the passengers traveling in them were stranded there for many
months. 21 A similar occurrence is reported approximately two hundred
years earlier for Alexandria, when the merchants refrained from load-
ing because the navy had conscripted all sailors in the town for its
galleys, and neither the merchants nor the skippers were sure what
would happen next. 22
 It has already been stated that in anticipation of trouble, merchant
ships made it a rule to sail in groups and not alone. Moreover, in times
of particular danger they formed regular convoys, accompanied by
warships. We read repeatedly in the Geniza records that the merchant-
men were ready to set sail and waited only for the men-of-war to join
them. 23 In addition, at such times, marines were stationed on the
merchantmen themselves. 24
 What could happen to such a convoy is vividly described in two
complementary letters, written in Alexandria around the middle of the
eleventh century. Altogether, twenty-two ships are mentioned by name
and the fate of each is recorded. In addition, the names of the business
friends of the addressee, a total of twenty-five, traveling in them and
what happened to each are reported. The convoy set sail in three suc-
cessive groups, called "sailings" (iqla'at), the first two consisting of
eight bottoms each. The first group consisted of a qunbar and a barge
of the amir, or governor, of Alexandria; three other barges, one be-
longing to a vizier, two khitis, one entitled "al-Ra'isa, 11 "the Chief,"
owned by a lady, and a craft called markab, the general word for ship.
The second group consisted of the ship of the sultan Mu'izz of Tunisia,
a ship and a barge belonging to a man from Seville, Spain, and several
other craft, among them one qunbar (as in the first group). These
ships sailed on Monday before Pentecost (month of May), but two
days later were overcome by a storm, in which the ship of the sultan
and another boat perished; the writer of our letters and the addressee
both had goods and friends in those ships. The convoy took refuge in
two anchoring places on the North African coast, one of which, (Ra's)
al-Kana'is, is frequently mentioned in our records and is still operating
today as a local harbor. (The late King Faruk had a summer palace
there, and since Ra's al-Kana'is means "Cape of the Churches," he
renamed it Ra's al-l;Iikma, "Cape of Wisdom.") Only five ships be-
longing to the first group succeeded in passing out into the high seas;
for in addition to the storm just mentioned, there was another calamity.
"The enemy," certainly the Byzantine navy, "which had complete
mastery over the sea," captured one boat and only because of its being
busy with it did the rest of the convoy escape. The remaining ships







 had to return to Alexandria, however, where the governor ordered
 them to be unloaded, obviously because he did not see any possibility
 of sending out a second convoy. 25 A similar occurrence, the unloading
 of ships ready to sail because the sea was closed on account of enemy
 activity, is referred to in another Geniza letter from the same time. 28
It was not only war and piracy that threatened the life, freedom,
 and property of a medieval traveler on the Mediterranean. Sometimes
 he was not even safe from the crew of the very ship in which he
 traveled. A case of murder of two young merchants using a Nile boat
 was described above (p. 299). A letter from Alexandria, written about
 1130, recounts how two Jewish notables, journeying on an Italian ship
 from Tunisia to Sicily, were robbed by the crew of large amounts of
 money and valuable consignments, as soon as they arrived on the
 island. Here, too, the Nagid was requested to intervene on their behalf.
 Such occurrences must have been frequent, as the Rhodian sea law
 contains detailed provisions dealing with cases of the robbery of pas-
 sengers by sailors, either on command of the captain or on their own
 initiative. 27
Despite all dangers and hardships connected with seafaring, the
 people represented in the Geniza letters were willing to assume the
 risks. "Losses on sea are made good quickly-if God will," says
 the writer of the report on the ill-fated convoy summarized above, add-
 ing other maxims used in similar circumstances: "May what has been
lost be a ransom and atonement for what we still have" and "Seeing
 what others have suffered, we must be consoled." 28 In a letter from Tyre,
 Lebanon, written approximately at the same time, the writer alludes to
his great losses on sea, but simultaneously expresses his thanks to God
who had replaced what he had lost many times over. In accordance
with the polite ways of that age, he adds that he would not have men-
 tioned his misfortunes at all had he not known the warm interest of
the addressee and would not want him to learn what had happened
from others. 29 The equal distribution of losses among the passenge_rs
of a ship or a convoy is discussed in the concluding section of this
chapter.


IO. PACKING, SHIPPING, AND STORAGE
 People mostly traveled as carriers of merchandise. Extended travel,
as a rule, meant transport. This explains why the Geniza records
abound in details about one almost as much as about the other. As
the subject is necessarily of a more technical nature, only its main
features are outlined here.
 In view of the long duration of a journey, the imperfect means of
transport, and the ever-present danger of damage by seawater, ade-
quate packing was of utmost importance. Its technicalities bad a great







 influence on the very organization of commerce. When we so often find
 that the same merchant traded in commodities as different as silk (or
 other textiles) and hides, the reason was that consignments of the first
 type were of ten packed together into one bale with those of the second,
 so that they were covered by them. A very ancient document from the
 town of Tunis, written on vellum, lists twelve bales each containing
 forty-four or forty-five robes and five hides, as well as four bales, each
 of which comprised fifty to fifty-two packages of sanitary napkins
 and twenty-nine hides. Similar combinations are found in other bills of
 lading.1
The merchants had a technical term for this "covering." Thus they
 would list consignments of garments, each of which were "covered"
 by larger or smaller quantities of mantles, all put inside sacks made of
 coarse drill. The amount of each commodity in every bale would be
 carefully listed, as was the case in another document on vellum, dated
 1024 and coming from Tunisia, as did the one just mentioned.2
Goods used as "covering" should not be confused with the packing
 materials proper. About thirty-five different types of packing materials
 and containers used in the Mediterranean trade have been noted so
 far in the Geniza records, varying, of course, according to the com-
 modity carried in them. Often our letters make mention only of the
 containers, as their very nature was sufficient to indicate their contents.
 Thus "skins" sent from Tunisia invariably meant 11 receptacles of olive
 oil," if it was not stated expressly that they contained soap or some-
 thing else. As flax was the staple good going from Egypt to the West,
 unspecified "bales" meant consignments of flax. A similar practice
 was in vogue in the India trade.
The most common packing material was a strong canvas, which was
 highly valued and not always obtained easily. Remarks about them
 are frequent: "X. wanted to have the canvas in which the silk was
 wrapped and pestered me for it. I said to him, 'Buy another one and I
 shall pay for it, for I do not want to unpack the bale.' Finally, he
 bought a canvas for four and half [dirhems] and I paid for it." "I
 have another load of sumac, but find no canvas to pack it. Had I canvas,
 I would have bought more of this commodity." "X. left the canvas with
 Y. in the market; please let him testify in the presence of two witnesses
 well known here that the canvas is my exclusive property." The
 second of these quotations comes from a letter from Ascalon, Palestine,
 the first and the third from Alexandria. In a letter from Upper Egypt,
 we read that the writer was unable to continue his business trip
 to the Fayyiim, because the government had laid its hands on the
 canvas.8
Another textile, frequently mentioned as a container, was a sack of
 coarse drill, tiUis (related to French treillis and English trellis), which
 was used mainly for grain and also designated a measure.' Pillowcases
 appear regularly as receptacles of silk, and also of indigo:1 Coarse hair-







 cloth served for the transport of wax, and oblong rugs (known as
 nakhkh) were spread over the bales to protect them from the rain. 8
 In many cases, the material of which the various bags and sacks were
 made is not indicated.
Next to woven fabric, skins and leather bags were the most fre-
 quently used containers. Not only oil, wine, and other liquids, but also
 such goods as indigo were carried in skins of different descriptions and
 sizes. Leather bags or knapsacks were used for more precious items,
 such as silk or parchment.' It seems that in medieval maritime trans-
 port, hides of animals had taken the place of the Greco-Roman
 amphora and other earthen vessels and had relegated the latter to
 third place as receptacles for the conveyance of victuals and other com-
 modities. To be sure, a great variety of jugs, jars, pitchers, bottles, and
 pots appear in the Geniza records as containers used for transportation,
 but for the large-scale overseas trade, skins were preferred. An under-
 water photograph of a Roman merchantman, which foundered near
 the French Riviera, shows it to be completely fiiled with tall jars. Had
 an eleventh-century boat been similarly well preserved, its cargo
 probably would have looked very different. In a letter written in or
 around 1061, a Tunisian merchant orders 100 large containers, ,arf, for
 oil in Egypt "those imported from Syria or Barqa." The same term is
 used for receptacles of alum in Almeria, Spain, in 1141, but there, too,
 the material from which they were made is not indicated.8
For transportation by sea, baskets of various forms and names were
 of no smaller importance than earthen vessels. Such common articles
 as copper, glass vessels, antimony, sal ammoniac, and even books were
 carried in wickerwork crates or other types of baskets. One single
 document, dated July 5, 1072, refers to seven items packed in such a
 way. A wickerwork crate containing 218-½ pounds of sal ammoniac,
 worth 2,065 dirhems, cost around A.D. 1000 only 4 {or 6 or 10) dirhems.9
Wood, of course, was rare around the southern and eastern coasts of
 the Mediterranean and served as packing material only for a limited
 number of goods, such as books, corals, bead.s, and saffron.10 Paper was
 used for the transport of smaller quantities both inside Egypt and in
 the intercountry caravan traffic. Thus we read about 1-lh pounds of
 Syracuse (Sicilian) silk, sent by land from al-Mahdiyya, to Egypt
 in a qirtiis (which is derived from the same Greek word chartes as
 the English card and chart). As is well known, the Romans used papy-
 rus as packing bags-pap er then was not yet in existence. Still, when a
 famous Persian traveler visited Cairo at approximately the time the
 Geniza letter just mentioned was written, he found it very strange that
 ordinary commodities bought in the bazaar were taken home wrapped
 in paper.11
Despite the high standards attained by the glass industry of the
 eleventh and twelfth centuries, glass vessels were rarely used for
 transportation in the Mediterranean area, even less, it seems, than in







the India trade. Once, we read about a glass jar with minced salt fish
sent from Alexandria to Old Cairo. An 'ulliiba containing Bible codexes
 (sent in the opposite direction) could hardly mean anything but a case
made of tin or lead. I do not know, however, whether these metals
were used at that time for the manufacture of containers.12
 The term tarlJ, (literally: deduction, but used in the sense "weight of
a container deducted from the total weight of a shipment"), which was
taken over by most European languages (cf. English tare), is not very
common in the Geniza documents for the simple reason that the tare is
rarely indicated in them. To quote an example, in an ancient account on
vellum from Tunisia, containing many items, only four entries list the
weight of the containers, as follows:

Bale of lacquer, total weight 289, tare 14 pounds
 " " 111111 288, " 17 " , including deduction for some
of the material which had
been spoiled
Skin with indigo, "II
 69, II3 "
r, " IIIIII
 67, II4 II [Thus!).13

This example, like countless others, also shows that packages of the
 same type in one shipment generally were of approximately the same
 weight. The most common type of package was a bale called 'idl, which
 originally designated (half) a camel load. Its standard weight was
 500 pounds, but in fact it often contained far less. Thus, in another
 ancient account on vellum, in which the details for thirty-five bales
 of flax are clearly visible, five weighed exactly 500 pounds, one 510,
 seventeen between 490 and 498, five between 482 and 489, and the re-
 maining seven, 472 or less. 14 Similarly, according to a letter con-
 temporary with the account just mentioned, 1,050 pounds of shelled al-
 monds were sent overseas in two bales.15 About a hundred years later,
 around 1135, sixty bales of lacquer, weighing 500 pounds each, were
 dispatched from Aden in South Arabia to Old Cairo.16 Bales of approx-
 imately the same weight are found in a number of other documents.17
There also appear in the Geniza records series of 'idls (or bales) that
 were of a far smaller capacity. Thus, in the account from Tunisia,
 dated 1024 (already quoted), most of the twenty-three bales of flax
 listed weighed between 339 and 350 pounds, while the standard weight
 for bales of pepper must have been 375 pounds at some time, for a bale
 containing 378 pounds was regarded as being 3 pounds overweight. 18
 Finally, according to the document quoted above in connection with
 the tare, an assortment of goods, ranging from sugar and rose marma-
 lade to indigo and lacquer, was packed in bales weighing between 230
 and 289 pounds.19
Smaller in size than the 'idl or bale, but also very frequently used,
 was the barqalii, probably related somehow to Italian barca, boat.







 This term makes its appearance, often together with 'idl, in documents
 as early as the beginning of the eleventh century. Thus a large consign-
 ment dispatched at that time from Alexandria to Tunisia on the ac-
 count of a leading merchant of Old Cairo comprised 179 bales and two
 barqaliis. This seems to mean that the merchant had intended to send
 180 bales; when there was not enough merchandise remaining to fill
 a bale, he made instead two packages of the smaller type. The standard
 weight of a barqaHi seems to have been 200 pounds.20
It seems strange that a "ship bale" should have been of such a
 comparatively small size. One has to take into account, though, that it
 was common practice to throw goods overboard during a storm (see
 p. 323, above), and in the event of an attack by pirates or other ene-
 mies, it was at times advantageous to be able to move a part of the
 cargo with ease. One letter states expressly that at a time when no ship
 except the sultan's would sail, the goods were packed in barqaliis.21
While the terms for "camel load" and "ship bale" carry with them
 a connotation of weight, this is not the case with two other extremely
 frequent words designating forms of packings, shikara (or shakiira)-
 also, it seems, derived from the Italian-meaning bag or sack, and
 rizma, a bundle, which has found its way into the English language in
 the form of ream (of paper). In a letter, sent from Aden to Sicily
 around 1150, a merchant writes: "I am sending you a bag," using the
 Arabic term which was in vogue in the India trade, "called [in the
 Mediterranean] shikara." 22 The shikara, which appears in the Geniza
 documents from the very beginning of the eleventh century, was used
 for commodities of all types and sizes. Weights noted at random range
 from 25 to 250 pounds. 28 The rizma, or bundle, could be of any size,
 often, however, it designates the largest unit sent in one consignment.
 Thus one single rizma would contain eight sacks, shikira, with silk of
 various kinds, one sack with tin and copper, twenty-five hides and
 sacks or coarse drill and canvas.24 In another such "bundle," at least
 eight merchants, not connected by partnership, sent goods of various
 types, such as silks and other textiles, clothes, and tin."
Packing was a complicated affair and required much attention. One
 merchant would supervise the work done for several of his business
 friends and partners, and report about its progress to them, as we
 often find in the Geniza. As for the marking of the packages, the
 greatest variety is to be observed in our records. Normally, the name
 of the sender or the receiver, or both, in Arabic and in Hebrew letters,
 or sometimes only in one of the two scripts, was written in red earth or
 with indigo on the bales. In many cases the name of the merchant
 accompanying the goods was indicated. These details were written on
 patches or wooden plates fastened to the tops of the bags and also on
 all sides and protruding parts. In skins, they were engraved on the
 "buttocks" or ends. Religious' formulas, such as "may God be its
 preserver" or "be it blessed," would precede the names. In addition,







since the porters presumably did not know how to read, consignments
were often marked with figurative designs. A merchant would use dif-
 ferent marks at one and the same time, as, for example, "two crescents"
on a bale going in one ship and "strit1gs of pearls and a palm tree" on
another, dispatched simultaneously. In some letters, the writers would
draw the figures used by them, and it is not always easy for us to make
out what they were meant to represent. Nahray b. Nissim frequently
used, among other marks, the six-cornered Star of David. It should
be remembered that this sign was not a typically Jewish emblem at
that time. 26
 In the preceding pages, we have reported various examples of com-
modities as different as silk and tin packed together in one bundle.
Many more examples could be given. Thus we find a package (rizma)
of mace, the spice made from the peel of the nutmeg, inside a wicker-
work basket of sal ammoniac; or a flask of the particularly valuable
perfume musk inside a bale of yellow myrobalan, an Oriental fruit used
for dyeing and tanning; and even a package of khazz silk inside a
consignment of wax. Whether this strange practice originated in the
desire to protect a particularly valuable commodity (as explained
above, p. 333) or had other reasons, say, the evasion of customs duties,
is difficult to say. 27
 From this practice we must distinguish another, which was extremely
common in the Mediterranean, but entirely absent from the India
trade, namely, the so-called 'ilawa-the attaching of a package to a
larger container by fastening it on top of the latter. Almost everything
could be sent as such an appendage. Examples noted at random in-
clude such different items as beads, mastic, sal ammoniac, sugar, and
cinnamon. 28 The quantities forwarded in this manner were by no means
negligible. Thus one 'ilawa contained 614 units (of at least a thousand)
beads, worth 1,200 dirhems, the cost of freight, customs duties, and
other expenses for the transport being in this case only 35 dirhems, or
less than 3 percent of the value of the consignment, while normally
these would amount to 7-10 percent (see pp. 343 ff., below). This ex-
plains perhaps why these appendages were so popular.29 'Ilawa is an
ancient Arabic word, and it stands to reason that this particular practice
was transferred from the caravan traffic to maritime transport.
 On the boat itself one tried to stow one's bales "in the best of places,"
"all in the hull, none on Ghe deck," but despite this and the care taken
in packing, we often read about bales that broke open during a voyage
at sea and about goods, in particular textiles and especially flax, spoiled
by water. If the boat carrying the shipments was not in adequate con-
dition, the skipper would indemnify the merchants by reducing the
freight (cf. p. 321, above). Sometimes warnings were expressed not to
use "those ships," as any flax sent in them would get wet. Particularly
troublesome was the case of goods contaminating each other in contact,
as when a load of pepper which was packed above another of wheat







 became discolored by it, or when mercury leaked out in a bale that con-
 tained other merchandise. The disintegration of bales also provided an
 opportunity for rapacious sailors and captains to appropriate some or
 all of their contents. Thus, a Spanish merchant, writing from Sicily, had
 this to report: "All the bales in the Sevillian (i.e., the boat belonging
 to a man from Seville) broke apart and their contents became mixed.
 The skipper of the ship looted the bales. Had not Abu 'l-Faraj been
 with him, nothing of our business friend's goods would have been
 saved." In general, losses caused by the ripping of the package were
 a serious risk for any shipment sent overseas. Thus we read in one
 case that twelve out of twenty-three, and in another even that seven
 out of eight, bales of flax sent from Egypt to Tunisia were damaged
 in this manner-an enormous disaster for the merchants concerned.so
On the other hand, we rarely hear about shipments lost. This was
 certainly due to the fact that they were normally accompanied by their
 proprietors or their business friends, or in the case of greater merchants,
 their agents, who sometimes had the legal status of slaves. Consign-
 ments might be lost in times of a general upheaval, as during a civil
 war, when a ship and part of its cargo were confiscated. When an item
 belonging to a merchant from a country not involved was lost in such
a case, his claim for indemnities was dismissed. Simple, accidental
 loss is seldom reported. 81 For the reason just mentioned, theft during
transport wa,s also not very common. When 20 of 176 pounds of a load
of tragacanth gum, going by boat from Alexandria to Old Cairo, were
stolen, the slave carrying them was suspected. In order to discourage
such occurrences, the bales were weighed after arrival.32
 As packing was an intricate and costly affair, and perhaps also for
protection of the merchandise, receivers of consignments were slow
in opening them. This would be done only if prospective buyers were in
sight. "I hope to find customers for my goods," writes a merchant from
Qayrawan, "so that I shall be able to unpack my shipment during this
winter." 33 In a letter from Old Cairo, addressed to a widely traveled
business friend sojourning in Jerusalem, the writer remarks that he
was unpacking his bales only gradually on account of a slump caused
by an epidemic. 84 Goods enclosed in shipments for other merchants
often had to wait until the latter would find it convenient to open
them. As we read in a letter from Sicily, a small charge was made for
"the untying" of goods thus carried even in the bales of acquaintances
or friends. 85
 In view of the fact that bales were left unopened for a long time, we
would imagine that the problem of storage was very acute. This, how-
ever, as the Geniza records amply prove, was not the case. Upon arrival,
the goods of foreign merchants would be provisionally stored in a
caravansarai, or directly deposited in the storehouse of a representa-
tive of the merchants. There also existed special warehouses for this
purpose, and the sender would be informed that his bales had been







"set up" in reasonable order "in a good place." 36 Local merchants had
storerooms either at the bazaar or in their own houses, sometimes both,
or possessed adjacent to their living quarters a special building com-
prising several, for example, three, storerooms, called makhazin (from
which the English word magazine is derived), of which a khazziin, or
storekeeper, would take care. Traders engaged in business over long
distances had storerooms or houses in other cities as well. 87 At times,
the bales were not stored in the warehouse itself, but on a special site
adjoining it. It seems, however, that this was done not because of
lack of space inside, but for special reasons, such as to have easier
access to the goods or perhaps because the rent was cheaper. Thus the
addressee is asked in one letter whether he would like to have his
goods stored inside the warehouse or in its court. 88 Sometimes these
"magazines" must have been of considerable size. In a letter from
Tunisia, the writer states that he could not locate a shipment of tin
in the family storehouse, hut would continue his efforts to find it.89 The
comparatively easy availability of room for storage tallies with the
fact that living space in general was plentiful, according to the Geniza
records. This matter is discussed in detail in my chapter on housing.-t0


 11. COST OF TRANSPORT
The Geniza letters teem with pertinent information on the cost of
 travel and transportation by water. The senders of those letters did
 not write for us, however, hut for the addressees, who knew all about
 the trip undertaken and the shipments dispatched and needed only
 some additional information to keep their records complete. The details
 required for an exhaustive study .of the subject-the ports of em-
 barkation and destination, description of the consignment, its weight
 and value, the freight and the customs paid-are rarely given in full,
 and very often all the expenses incurred during a journey (namely, the
 freight, customs, and other dues) are lumped together. Only by care-
 ful comparison and combination with related documents are we some-
 times able to supply the missing items. Since many documents still
 await such scrutiny, much additional research is necessary before the
 rich Geniza material on the subject can be fully utilized.
In order to give the reader an idea of the manifold expenses con-
 nected with medieval transport in the ,Mediterranean region and in
 order to let him participate in the difficulties experienced in this section
 of Geniza research, a single account, which is fairly complete and de-
 tailed, is discussed here. It deals with a bale of "purple," that is,
 crimson-colored textiles, weighing 474 pounds and having, at the place
 of dispatch, a value of 66-¼ dinars. The average weight of a piece of
 cloth was approximately one pound; thus one "purple" would have
 cost its producer only about a seventh of a dinar. For us, to whom







 purple is a royal or ecclesiastical emblem, the comparatively small
 price is somewhat surprising. But since we read in another Geniza
 letter of the same period and referring to a consignment sent from the
 same place, that eight pieces of "purple" were bought for 1 dinar1 we
 are assured that the price indicated was perfectly normal.1
The bale was dispatched from Old Cairo. Of course, this is not
 stated expressly. It can, however, be safely inferred from three com-
 bined facts: the customs were paid "at the arsenal" (~ina'a; the English
 word arsenal is derived from the Arabic through Spanish), which was,
 in Fatimid times, the main Nile port of Old Cairo.2 The bale went by
 boat to Rosetta on the left arm of the Nile and from there the short
 distance to Alexandria on camel's back; thus its place of dispatch
 could hardly have been any town except Old Cairo. In addition, the
 sender, 'Anis b. Joseph was a merchant who, as we know from other
 Geniza records, lived in that town and was engaged in the manufacture
 of purple clothes; indeed, he was called "the purple-maker." 8
Alexandria is not expressly mentioned in the account either, but
 since the camel load entered the city referred to through the Gate of
 the Sidriyya, or zizyphus tree ("Christ's thorn"), occasionally men-
 tioned in our papers as the entrance by land to Alexandria, there re-
 mains no doubt as to the identity of the second intermediary station.4
As to the place of final destination, we find that .the cost of trans-
 port from Alexandria to it was about four times as much as that paid
 from Old Cairo to Rosetta (see p. 343). Secondly, oil was sent back
 from there to Egypt. Thirdly, the merchant's agent "bought" there a
 large amount of gold pieces coined in Marrakesh, a town in Morocco
(the English name for the country is derived from the name of that
 town). Finally-and this is the decisive detail-the agent changed a
 limited amount, namely, 2 gold pieces, into the currency of Sfax, the
 seaport of southern Tunisia, prominent in our records as a center for
 the export of oil. Thus we have all the reason to believe that the bale
 of "purple" under discussion was sent to Sf ax and sold there/' The fact
 that our agent "bought," or exchanged, a part of the proceeds for
 Moroccan money does not refute this assumption, but, on the contrary,
 corroborates it. The account was written around 1100, for our "purple-
 maker" is known to have been active between 1080 and 1120 approxi-
 mately. At that time, Tunisia was politically dismembered and eco-
 nomically ruined. The gold pieces of Morocco, which was then ruled
 by the powerful Almoravid dynasty, were so excellent that, under the
 name almoravidis, they were in circulation even throughout southern
 Europe. In other Geniza records, too, we find various merchants, in-
 cluding another representative of our purple-maker, acquiring almora-
 vidis while doing business in Tunisia (cf. p. 236, above).
In OJd Cairo, 'Ariis himself paid ¾ dinar for packing (hides, ropes,
 and service charge) , three times as much as the fare from Old Cairo to
 Rosetta. In addition, he gave 5 dinars to his agent for "expenditure,"







that is, all expenses to be incurred for the bale, until it would reach
the seagoing vessel (or, as we would say, f.o.b. Alexandria). The
far greater expenses to be expected in Tunisia, including the main pay-
ment for the freight (see below), would be deducted from the price
obtained there.
 In order to understand the complicated account, one has to bear in
mind that in all instances where no express mention is made of a gold
dinar or a fraction thereof, silver dirhems are intended. One dinar in
this document had the value of about 36.3 silver dirhems, a rate of
exchange normal for that time. 8
 At the port of embarkation, the "arsenal" of Old Cairo, there were,
besides the transport to the Nile and the porters, quite a number of items
that call for comment. As in medieval Europe, customs or "dues"
were paid in the Muslim countries not only at a frontier, but in
every place where the government saw fit to have a customs station and
not only for imports, but also for exports.' Thus, for our bale of purple,
dues were payable three times within Egypt, at Old Cairo, at Rosetta,
and at Alexandria. Moreover small sums were due for the seal on the
consignment, for the official money changer, for the "mark on the patch"
 (obviously the mark of the merchants discussed above, p. 337), for
two persons called by name, and for two other items, for which, thus
far, no parallels have been found in other Geniza papers. The freight,
which included the fare for the person accompanying it, as in the
Italian shipping of that period, was normally paid after arrival, and
therefore does not appear in the section dealing with the expenses in-
curred in Old Cairo. At embarkation, however, the sailors received a
tip, as was customary in both sea and river traffic.
 Upon arrival at Rosetta, first the freight and the "dues" had to
be paid. In addition, there were smaUer payments for "transit permit
for one piece," 8 for the use of the landing place, and for a registrar.
In Rosetta, the bale was entrusted to a camel-driver, who was accom-
panied by an escort of three guards. On the way, a canal, or rather a
part of the large lake of Edfu, was crossed by a ferry, requiring a fee.
Again, the payment to the camel-driver is registered in the subsequent
section, as it was made only after the arrival in Alexandria. On the
other hand, the traveler had to provide bread for his four companions
and had to pay the guards at the time he hired them. It is remarkable
that such strong protection was needed on a highway between two
cities so near to each other as Rosetta and Alexandria.•
 While passing through the Sidriyya Gate of Alexandria, again
"transit of one piece" had to be paid, and the gatekeepers and inspec-
tors had to be remunerated. The transport of the bale to a storehouse,
the rent of a place in its court, guarding it, two nights' lodging, and
some other minor items are registered. The largest single sum paid in
Alexandria was, of course, the customs impost, over three times as
much as that paid in Old Cairo and appearing here under the heading







 "to the officials of the diwiin" (literally: office; cf. French douane, cus-
 toms house). The bale had to be repacked for sea transport, and in ad-
 dition to the packer, specialist "fasteners," mentioned also in other
 papers, had to be paid and tipped, presumably for fixing the bale se-
 curely in the ship. In order to embark, one had to pass through a gate
 once again with the usual tipping of the gatekeepers and inspectors,
 and at the dock two other officials had to be remunerated for their
 services or for refraining from interference.
As we have seen, payments for transportation, whether by land or
 by water, were made after arrival. In sea transport, however, a part of
 the freight had to be paid in advance, wherefore "freight" on a sea-
 going vessel was called in the language of ·that time 11 advance." 1 ° For
 our bale of purple, 1 dinar was paid down in Alexandria and another
 3 dinars and 1 qirat were remitted after arrival in Tunisia. The
 gratuity given to the sailors in Alexandria at the time of embarkation
 was astonishingly low: 2 silver dirhems, only twice as much as that
 given in Old Cairo for the short voyage on the Nile down to Rosetta.
 In some other documents, the gratuity or "bribe" given to the captain
 and the sailors was rather high.11
Altogether, forty-five payments for a great variety of services) and
 made to many different persons, were necessary for the transport of one
 bale of purple cloth from Old Cairo to the ship setting sail in Alex-
 andria. It is the more remarkable that the actual expenses amounted
 to almost the exact amount estimated by the merchant before the dis-
 patch: 118-½ against 120 qirats, or only 5 dinars (see above, p. 340),
 a difference of slightly more than 1 percent. This, taken together with
 similar statements, shows that the Mediterranean transport business
 of medieval times, complicated as it seems, nevertheless enjoyed a high
 degree of regularity and stability. It should be noted that the data
 derived here from a Geniza account are in complete accordance with
 the picture emanating from a Muslim literary source dealing with cus-
 toms dues and commerce in this period. 12
In Sfax, Tunisia, where our agent was apparently a foreigner, every-
 thing was done by the local representative of the merchants, who, it
 se'ems, had also traveled with him on the same boat. The bale was taken
 to his storage warehouse and weighed there. After a deduction of thirty
 pounds for the tare, and three and a half pounds given to the "sultan
 and the young men," (i.e., a government office and its employees),
 440-½ pounds remained, which were sold £or 264 dinars and 7 qirats of
 local currency, worth around 94 Egyptian dinars (see p. 202, above).
 The following deductions from the price obtained should be noted:
 commission or brokerage fee, most probably received by the representa-
 tive of the merchants, 6 dinars, 15 qirits; sales tax, 7 dinars, 1
 qirit; "for the young men and the sultan" (listed in this order), 1
 dinar, 21 qirits (i.e., another government office); dues paid at the
 gate, 1 dinar, 8 qirit,s. There were other expenses, such as the transport







to the warehouse and from there to the inn or caravansary, and the rent-
ing of a storeroom (until the goods would be paid for and fetched).
 One item in the list from Sfax remains enigmatic: "A present [ or,
perhaps, a lamb] instead of gold due to the custom.,, Since, in the
continuation of the account (not discussed here), another consignment
brought from Egypt -bythe- Iocal representative of the merchants is
referred to, it is possible that our bale of purple cloth was registered as
being imported by him and therefore exempt from import dues. In
order to make things smoother, perhaps a present was given to the
official concerned. The word translated here tentatively as "present" or
"lamb" may simply be a mistake of the copyist, and the real meaning
of that item remains obscure. In any case, ¼ dinar could not represent
customs duties for goods worth a thousand times more.
 Summarizing this detailed account, we learn that customs and other
dues for the dispatch of one bale, worth 66-¼ dinars, from Old Cairo
f.o.b. Alexandria, required around 3 dinars (or about 5 percent), and
the transport approximately 1 dinar (or 1.5 percent). The freight from
Alexandria to Tunisia, half the length of the Mediterranean sea, was
a little over 4 dinars, or about 4 percent of the price of about 94 Egyp-
tian dinars finally obtained, while the government dues connected
with the sale amounted to about 4 percent.
 With this account, rendered for a single bale, another, made for
one of the largest shipments ever mentioned in the Geniza, might be
compared. This is contained in a huge, but much damaged, document,
written on vellum early in the eleventh century and referring to 133
bales of Egyptian flax sold in the West (Sicily or Tunisia}. The total
price was 1,497-% dinars and 32,421 dirhems, at a time when the rate
of exchange between gold and silver coins was around I :39 (as is evi-
dent from many details in the account itself). The expenses for customs
and transport were 161 dinars and 393-½ dirhems. Converting the dir-
hems into dinars, we find that proceeds amounted to about 2,318 dinars,
and expenditure for customs and freight came to 171, a little over
7 percent, which tallies with the figures listed in the previous account.18
 Naturally, the cost of both government dues and transport varied
according to the type and weight of the commodities carried and ac-
cording to the countries and, as we have seen, even the towns concerned.
Nevertheless, the figures obtained from the two accounts discussed are
fairly representative of the conditions prevailing during the eleventh
and the first half of the twelfth centuries. A few examples illustrate
these conditions.
 In 1143, a consignment of silk, weighing 144-½ pounds and having
an estimated value of 190-½ dinars, was charged in Alexandria with
imposts totaling 8 dinars and 2-¼ qirat,a, or about 4 percent. The
freight costs {presumably for the transport from Sicily or Tunisia)
were 3-¼ dinars, a little over 1-½ percent. One hundred and twenty
years earlier, in 1024, a bale of textiles, worth about 600 rubi'is or







 quarter dinars, sent from Tunisia to Egypt, cost 6-¾ ruba'is freight,
 slightly more than 1 percent of its value. For a shipment of madder
 dye, which around 1100 brought a price of 5-½ dinars in Old Cairo,
 customs duties to the amount of ¼ dinar were defrayed in Alexandria
 -again about 5 percent.14
The freight for bulky goods, such as olive oil, wool, wax, or pitch,
 naturally constituted a far higher percentage of the price. At the end
 of the account for the bale of purple discussed above, mention is made
 of a shipment of olive oil (from Tunisia to Egypt) worth 22-¼ dinars
 and requiring 6-½ dinars for freight and customs. The same 'Ariis b.
 Joseph sending 5 qintars of wool worth 30 dinars from Alexandria to
 Almeria, Spain, had to pay 6 dinars for freight, of which one-half was
 defrayed in Alexandria and the rest at the port of destination.15 Forty
 years earlier, the shipping of 6 skins with olive oil and 5 with pitch
 from Sfax in Tunisia to near al-Mahdiyya and from there to Mazara in
 Sicily cost 8 dinars, but fetched a total price of only 168 quarter dinars
 or 42 dinars.16 At the same time approximately, 10 earthen jugs with
 soap weighing 645 pounds and worth 13- 2 %4 dinars paid 3-½ 6 dinars
 freight for the transport from Tunisia to Egypt. 11 A generation earlier,
 around 1030, 21 hundredweights of wax with a total value of 100--120
dinars required 15 dinars for the same way. 18
 All in all, it appears that in the period under discussion customs
 duties and costs of transport were not excessively high.
 It is perhaps owing to this fact that we find in the Geniza papers
 very few remarks about attempts to cheat and to evade customs duties.
Only in times and places where special charges were imposed, which
were regarded as unjust, do such remarks become frequent. Thus in
Sicily around 1060, when Muslim rule was nearing its end, and in
Morocco a little later, a tithe incumbent on foreign, hut not on local,
merchants was imposed. To us this seems perfectly normal. At that
time, however, such discriminatory treatment of foreigners was re-
garded as outrageous. The latter often pretended that their goods be-
longed to local merchants and mishaps are recorded as the consequence
of such fraud. Finally, this particular cu.stoms duty on the goods of
foreign merchants was abolished, at least in Sicily.19
 Thus one gets the impression that with the exception of cases such as
those just noted, the Muslim countries represented in the Geniza records
formed a sort of customs union: customs were paid in many places,
as we have seen, even inside the same country, but no distinction was
made between local and foreign traders. Moreover, it seems that in the
Fatimid period, the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the whole Medi-
terranean area comprised such a free-trade community. To be sure,
Jews and Christians living in Muslim countries had to pay a poll tax
and, while proceeding from one country to another, had to produce a
certificate showing that they had fulfilled that obligation. Foreigners
from a non-Muslim country had to pay a special t-011 while crossing







the frontier. It seems to be certain that the Muslim canonical law,
which imposes a double customs duty on non-Muslim merchants, was
not enforced during the Fatimid period, for if it were otherwise it is
unthinkable that in the many hundreds of business letters written by
Jews during that period allusion should never be made to its existence.
Only at the time of the orthodox reaction under Saladin (1171-1193)
was it enforced for a short period. Then an India trader on his way
home is instructed by his brother in Alexandria to entrust his goods to
a Muslim fellow traveler in order to save the additional customs dues
incumbent on non-Muslims. 20 Saladin's edict was soon repealed by
himself, as is reported in detail in another letter from Alexandria. 21
 On the other hand, it seems that the tolls for the transport of even
small quantities of foodstuffs within a country annoyed the population
and were often evaded. Here we read about professional smugglers,
such as two Shamis (Byro-Palestinians), who were renowned for
being successful in smuggling everything into the capital of Egypt from
the little towns of the Egyptian countryside. Sometimes the dangerous
task of smuggling into Old Cairo was left to slaves.22 On Nile boats,
a maximum weight for bales was prescribed, at least at a certain
period. In a letter from Bii~ir to Fustat, the addressee is advised to
bribe the official weigher, for the writer's hales of flax were over-
weight. But no such attempt should be made, if the customs authorities
had already been informed of that fact. The writer seems to have had
experience in such matters. 28
 Unpleasant surprises always have to be taken into account at a
customs station. A boat on its way from Alexandria to Fustat moored,
unexpectedly it seems, in al-Maqs, the port of (New) Cairo, and the
tax-farmer of the port customs there 14 inspected" the goods, obviously
intending to exact payments. 24 Great tribulation could be caused a mer-
chant when the customs house was closed just at the time of most urgent
business, as we read on page 201, above. The nonappearance of cus-
toms officials in time must have been a familiar nuisance. A com-
merical treaty between Florence and a Mamluk Sultan from the year
1489 devotes a full clause to it: after three days of delay the foreign
merchants were permitted to pay the customary dues to the local
governor and then to sell their goods. 25 When a traveler suddenly dis-
covered that he did not have enough money to pay for the customs,
he had to leave behind a part of his goods as security for later pay-
ment.26
 The word "customs," maks, had a bad sound in Arabic, for accord-
ing to Muslim religious conceptions, "customs" were illegal and sinful.
 (This word has some history behind it: it is derived from the same
Aramaic root as the word used by Jesus when he spoke out against the
"publicans"; and the proper place for publicans is Hell-in Islam
as in Christendom and Judaism.) Therefore, the technical term "cus-
toms" was often replaced by innocent or general words, such as 11dues"







 or "payments." 21 The translation and discussion by Claude Cahen of
 a Muslim handbook on administration, dealing, inter alia, with the
 customs dues in the Mediterranean ports of Egypt has opened a new
 era in the study of this important aspect of medieval commerce. The
 widely dispersed, but rich and variegated Geniza material on the
 subject, once properly collected, will form a living commentary on this
 and other literary sources.28


 12. ON TRAVEL IN GENERAL
"Shall I undertake this journey or not?" "Will it be successful?"
 "Will I come home safely?" The writers of the Geniza letters, like
 their Muslim contemporaries, tried to find answers to such questions
 by istikhiira (literally: entreating God to choose the best for them).
 One would never write, "I decided to make this trip," but rather, "I
 asked God to choose for me" (implying "and have received a favorable
 reply") .1
The istikhara could take different forms. One of the most popular
 was "looking into the Bible"-a form of divination common also in
 medieval Europe. Thus a woman from Egypt, living in "Romania"
(a part of the Byzantine empire), who wanted to return to her home
 country, writes in a Hebrew letter: "I looked into the Torah scroll,
 which showed me that my luck was bad and that l would not be
 successful; therefore, I could not come together with the bearers of
 this letter." 2
In order to ensure one's safe return, one might also resort to outright
 magical procedures before embarking on a journey, and as the texts
 telling us about them are written in scholarly hands, we can be sure
 that these practices were by no means confined to the lower strata of
 the society. 3 Such texts are rare, however, and, thus far, not a single
 reference to magical practices has been found in a letter. I take this as
 an indication that they were not very prominent in the minds of the
 travelers.
In the main, a traveler relied for his protection on the prayer of
 his relatives and friends-in particular, on that of his mother, another
 elderly woman, or a saintly person known to him. In a great many
 letters, the writers ask-while setting out on a journey or while abroad
 -to be included in the prayers of the addressee and of other persons
 specified. In some cases, such requests sound like an expression of
 reverence or even of mere politeness toward those referred to. Mostly,
 however, one feels that the writer lives in dread and sincerely relies
 on the efficacy of intercession by those loved or respected by him.
In addition to prayer, such intercession could also consist of fasting
 or other privations, which were regarded as sacrifices by the people
 remaining at home for the benefit of the members of the family who







 were abroad. Thus a widow writing from Tunisia, although herself
 in great distress, owing to the invasion of the country by Italian pirates,
 informs her brother, who was in the East, that when she heard of his
 illness, she swore (a) not to take any food during daytime, (b) not
 to change her clothes, and (c) not to visit the public bathhouse, the
 popular place of amusement of those days. Similar declarations are
 made in other letters. 4
Before setting out on a journey, one would also make preparations
 of a more practical nature. As far as business trips are concerned, we
 have already seen how vital letters of introduction were for anyone
 proceeding to a country with which he was little acquainted or al-
 together unfamiliar. For people traveling for other purposes, such
 letters were even more urgent, and quite a number of documents of
 this type have been preserved. First, such a letter would state the
 purpose of the bearer's journey, for when a person did not go abroad
 on business, the reason for his travel would not be self-evident. Sec-
 ondly, it would explain why the bearer was in particular need of help,
 what kind of assistance was required, and why the receiver, more
 than anyone else, was the person to provide it. Thirdly, the letter
 would emphasize that the person recommended was really worthy of
 the addressee's attention. Finally, it gave assurance that any assistance
 given to the bearer would be regarded by the sender as if he himself
 had benefited by it. Sometimes such letters are worded rather strongly,
 ending with the formula: "I hope to receive from X [the man recom-
 mended] letters full of praise for you and specifying all that you
 have done for him." The smooth and stereotyped style of such letters
 seems to indicate that in the Middle Ages (just as in our own time)
 there must have been people to whom the writing of letters of recom-
 mendation was a favorite pastime.5
Another item much sought after by persons traveling to foreign
 countries or a hosttle environment was a letter of safe-conduct. Thus
 we find a European traveler, who had experienced grave troubles in
 the Egyptian seaport Damietta, where he had been able to save him-
 self from imprisonment only by paying heavy bribes, requesting such
 a letter from Abu Sa'd al-Tustari. 6 Half a century later, another
 European, Isaac Benveniste of Narbonne, France, asks for a similar
 letter from al-Malik al-Afg,al, the viceroy of Egypt, again for passage
 through Damietta. The details mentioned in the request are of interest.
 The letter was to include permission to proceed to any country,
 whether Muslim or Christian, as well as strong warnings to captains
 and sailors not to molest the traveler.1 We find even that a traveler
 from Old Cairo to Alexandria was concerned with his security within
 that turbulent Mediterranean port, and requested a letter to safeguard
 his person during his sojourn there. 8
An indispensable part of the preparations for any journey was the
 choosing of a companion, rafiq. As a rule, one never traveled alone.







"The companion is more important than the route taken/' says an
often quoted Arabic proverb, implying that it was worth while chang-
ing the route in order to have the opportunity to travel together with
someone pleasant, resourceful, and trustworthy. This institution of
the individual fellow companion is to be distinguished from the prac-
tice of joint travel in a caravan or convoy. While the latter could
roughly be compared to a group brought together during a conducted
tour, we have nothing comparable to the institution of the rafiq,
which was necessitated by the insecurity, discomfort, and length of
medieval travel. The word appears mostly in the singular, which means
that two persons were connected by special bonds, although, as a rule,
more than two acquaintances traveled together. This connection had
even legal consequences, so that when suspicion fell on a traveler, his
companion would also be implicated.9 The thirteenth-century Muslim
writer Ibn Sa'id lakes it for granted that a traveler would be im-
prisoned, beaten, and tortured when his rafiq died because the local
authorities would assume that the latter had left money with him.10
In a report of a disaster at sea, when one was usually very exact, it
was sufficient to state: Mr. X and his rafiq, Mr. Y and his rafiq, have
perished, because the names of the travel companions would be known
to the receiver of the letter. 11 In a carefully drawn up list of foreigners
in receipt of loaves of bread from the community, a European Jew
"and his fellow traveler" are noted. 12 Letting a friend or relative depart
without a personal companion, even on a short trip, was regarded as a
disgrace. 18 Among the wishes extended to a person on a journey was also
the blessing: "May God grant you good companionship," which,
however, had perhaps the same meaning as the farewell wish still
used today in Persian, namely: "May God be your fellow traveler." u
 Merchants traveling together in times of danger would sometimes
form a loosely organized group, with one of them in command.15 This,
however, was not common. In a late, sixteenth-century document, we
read that a caravan consisting of merchants from Aleppo could not
leave Damascus, hecause they had not yet chosen a leader. 1• Losses
incurred in throwing overboard, shipwreck, piracy, or war would be
equally shared by those concerned. There was a special term for this
"proportional participation in losses," used in the areas of both the
Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, which shows that the procedure
was generally accepted. This equal distribution, however, did -not
comprise all those traveling in one caravan or a convoy, but only
those traders who had formed a special syndicate of common business
interests in general. It is unfortunate that the texts studied so far are
not more specific about this interesting aspect of medieval travel.11
 Whenever feasible, one left on the morning following the weekly
day of rest or a holiday. This had practical reasons: People naturally
wanted to spend their free time with their families and would also try
to reach their destination before the following weekend. When we find







that many letters are dated either on the day before or the night or
the day after a holiday, this also had its reason, at least partly, in the
fact that companies of travelers to whom letters were entrusted used
to depart immediately after the day of rest.18 Although belief in pro-
pitious or ominous days (in particular: Tuesday, propitious, Wednes-
day, ominous) must have been widespread, as may be concluded from
the evidence of Arabic and Hebrew literature and of present-day folk-
lore, no traces of such belief-at least with regard to travel-have
been found thus far in the Geniza. 19
 Travel normally required staying overnight away from home.
Caravansaries, or inns, built in such a way as to provide space for
both the traveler and his goods, met this need. AI-Qalqashandi, the
great Egyptian antiquarian (d. 1418), states that public inns, or
funduqs (the word is derived from Greek through Aramaic and passed
later on to the Italians as f ondago, today fondaco), were introduced
only after the Fatimid period. 20 Since we hear in the Geniza about
 funduqs throughout the eleventh and twelfth centuries, however, the
learned antiquarian must have been thinking of the large compounds
serving as caravansaries, erected as pious foundations by sultans, gov-
ernors, and other great people. These were indeed characteristic for the
 thirteenth and later centuries, and at that time we also find such
 funduqs among the property of religious communities. 21
As to the cost of lodging, we find expenses of 1-½ dirhems "for the
 funduq" and of 1 "for passing the night" in an account referring to the
 year 1045 and the town al-Mahdiyya. The former figure certainly
 refers to the payment for the storage of the traveler's consignment (a
 bale to which two packages were attached) and the latter to that
 charged for his lodging. Exactly the same differentiation is made in
 the account of around 1100 from Alexandria, discussed pp. 339 ff.,
 above, and the rate for the storage was the same: 1-½ dirhems for
 one bale.22
Sometimes travelers had to stay in a funduq for a prolonged period.
 Thus in an unfortunately much-damaged letter from the very begin-
 ning of the eleventh century, the writer states that he would hate to
 remain in the Caravansary of the Raisins for a full month (tied down
 to the addressee's 58 bales), since his travel companion was spending
 the nights elsewhere. 23 We find letters in the Geniza addressed to inns,
 just as we might give a hotel as our temporary address. One, from the
 beginning of the thirteenth century, in Hebrew characters was sent
 to Old Cairo to the caravansarai of al-Mal;alli (family name derived
 from the town al-Mal;alla)-a well-known compound, large enough
 even to accommodate a mosque. 24 Another, at least one hundred and
 fifty years older, is even more interesting. Its address, in Arabic
 characters, reads as fol1ows: 11 To Susa [a seaport in northern Tunisia],
 to the inn at the Msaken 25 gate, opposite the mosque." Such specifica-
 tion seems to indicate that even in a comparatively small town like







 Susa there must have been several inns. It is also significant that the
 addressee, a prominent member of the well-known Tiherti family,
 stayed in a caravansarai, although a number of his close relatives are
 known to have Iived in Susa at that time. He likely did this because
 he had to look after the consignments mentioned in the letter.28
It is perhaps not surprising that a funduq was also a place where
 one could meet, or was suspected to have met, with a woman of bad
 reputation. The letter referring to such an incident is from Alexandria
 and speaks about "one of the caravansarais.'' 27 A later Muslim author
 defines the term prostitute by "a woman living in a funduq." And
 when in the newly discovered writings of a Judeo-Christian sect,
 Helena, the mother of emperor Constantine, is repeatedly described
 as a funduqiyya, the same meaning is intended.28
In smaller places at least, it seems, one booked in advance and paid
 even when the reserved accommodation was not used. At least, thus
 I understand the following sentence in a long, but incomplete, letter,
 speaking about a night's stay in Qalyub, a little town near Old Cairo:
 "I paid him for two nights, saying to him that perhaps no one else
 would stop at his place." 29
Needy travelers were accommodated in buildings provided by their
 religious communities. The rather strange incident concerning the
 synagogue of Caesarea, Palestine (mentioned p. 321, above) may
 serve as a case in point. This custom is discussed in the chapter on
 communal institutions.30
Distinguished visitors from overseas and better-class merchants
 would seek more comfortable quarters than a noisy caravansarai.
 Wealthy traders possessed houses in the different countries they fre-
 quented or would exchange hospitality with relatives and intimate
 business friends. Otherwise, it seems, people were reluctant to accept
 invitations for a prolonged stay with acquaintances. One preferred
 renting a house or an apartment for the duration of one's stay in a
 foreign town. Only over the Sabbaths and holidays would one accept
 the invitations of distinguished hosts. The social duties of a visitor
 from abroad were many, and one tried not to oblige oneself too
 heavily.81
While moving from one locality or country to another, different
 methods were in vogue. A merchant emigrating from southern Tunisia
 to Sicily-quite a distance-first bought a house in the new place and
 then went back to fetch his family, even though in this case it was late
in the year and a war was going on in that part of the Mediterranean.82
 Conversely, a scholar intending to leave the Egyptian countryside for
 Old Cairo asked a friend to rent him a place for two months, during
 which he would look for a permanent domicile. 83 In one case we read
 that a man emigrating overseas took with him f umiture, bedding,
 clothing, ledgers, books, documents, and one illegible item. The details







are mentioned, as may be expected, because everything was lost at
sea.31
 A serious aspect of medieval travel was its long duration and con-
sequently the protracted absence of the traveler from his home. Periods
of 4, 5, and 8 years are mentioned, as far as the Mediterranean area is
concerned, and Miriam, the sister of Moses Maimonides, in a letter to
her illustrious brother, complains that her son had traveled away and
completely disappeared "as if he had fallen into a well." 85 How to
provide financially for his family, how to ensure that household and
business would be conducted properly during his absence, how to soothe
the anxiety and impatience of his wife, how to overcome his own yearn-
ing and homesickness, how to manage that his sons would get a proper
education and his daughters' husbands-all these were problems that
incessantly vexed a father on a journey. We hear their echo in many
letters, as well as in court records and other legal documents. We shall
meet with their implications and complications in the subsequent vol-
umes of this book.
 A minor tribulation for the traveler, not unfamiliar to ourselves, was
the obligation to bring home presents for every member of the house-
hold. As we have seen, even the maidservant, although legally a slave,
was by no means to be forgotten. 86 A sister admonishes her brother
abroad to bring appropriate presents for his two little girls "and their
mother" (i.e., his wife), lest the addressee, known from other letters
as a very much occupied and difficult person, forget his duty. 87 The
traveler's mother required particular attention.38
Upon arrival, the travelers had to undergo a number of formalities,
such as the scrutiny of their papers (e.g., in case of non-Muslims,
 whether they had paid their poll tax). Therefore, we occasionally read
 that the newcomers did not disembark immediately after arrival. Thus
 passengers, arriving from Sicily in Alexandria on Friday, August 9,
1062, could not leave the boat until Sunday. A traveler from Spain,
arriving at the same port on Sunday morning, September 8, 1140, was
 still on board on the evening of the same day, while a local passenger
 had already landed. So far nothing has been found about a medical
 examination of incoming passengers in a Mediterranean port, such as
 was usual in Aden with regard to ships coming from India. 39
Coming home from an extensive voyage was an occasion for a great
family celebration. Relatives and friends would come from near and
fa.r to express their "congratulations" -the same term was used as on
the occasion of a wedding or a high holiday. When a friend was un-
able to come in person, or when a large company of business friends
arrived on the same boat so that it was cumbersome to attend con-
gratulation ceremonies for each of them or even to write to each of
them individually, adequate excuses were made, which we now read in
the Geniza letters. The Hebrew benediction to be said when seeing a







friend after a long period of separation was: "Blessed be He who
resurrects the dead." 40
 In biblical times, a traveler, after having safely returned from a
voyage by sea, would present an oblation of thanksgiving in the
Temple of Jerusalem. Later, this offering was replaced by alms given
to the poor. Collections were made among travelers after their arrival
in a port.41 After returning home "safe in souls and goods," they would
receive letters from needy persons congratulating them and, at the
same time, alluding discreetly to the writers' own tribulations, such as
imprisonment because of the inability to pay the poll tax, tribulations
that could be alleviated or removed by an appropriate gift.42
 The last trial for a Jewish traveler coming home was the ceremony
of public thanksgiving in the synagogue, and there were certainly
similar functions in the churches and mosques. The custom goes back
to Psalm 107:23-32, verses that re-create such a ceremony in immortal
words, familiar to every reader of the Bible. Jewish ritual regulated
the ceremony and made it comparatively simple: the traveler, when
called up to read a portion from the weekly section of the Bible, would
add: "Blessed be He who bestows bounties on sinners. He has favored
me with His bounties." Medieval taste for pomp was not satisfied
with this, but required the addition of appropriate quotations. This is
where some travelers, after having braved all the vicissitudes of their
journey, got into trouble. This is exemplified in a little strip of paper,
bearing the following entreaty: "My father has come back from his
voyage and is bound to be called up to recite the benediction 'Blessed
be He who bestows bounties on sinners.' He kisses your hands and
asks you kindly to select for him some appropriate Bible quotations
for the occasion." 43
 To have traveled widely was a title of pride. No wonder that some
ambitious person tried to usurp that title without having deserved it.
The Geniza contains a note addressed to Maimonides asking the some-
what quaint question what to do with a man who ascended the reader's
platform of a synagogue and pronounced the benediction of thanksgiv-
ing for safe return from travel by sea, but had not traveled at all.
The master's answer to this query, if given at all, has not been pre-
served/~

 Appendix A
DATES AND NAMES



I. DATES
This and the next appendix do not present the voluminous Oeniza ma-
 terial on dates, names, coins and weights, but are intended to familiarize the
 reader with the most common terms and relevant facts and the problems
 involved in them.·
Several systems of dating, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian (Coptic), existed
 side by side and sometimes were applied simultaneously in the same docu-
 ment. The Jews mostly used their own, but often, especially in accounts and
 legal documents, made mention also of Muslim months and years. The Coptic
 calender rarely appeared (except in references to seafaring); it was used,
 for instance, when a happy father notes the exact date of the birth of a son
 according to all the various calendars in vogue in the three religious com-
 munities.
The standard work on the Jewish calendar is Handbuch der jildischen
 Chronologie by Eduard Mahler (Leipzig, 1916), cited hereafter as Mahler.
 Edgar Frank, Talmudic and Rabbinical Chronology (New York, 1956) also
 has some bearing on the topics treated here. For books on Muslim chronology
 see Sauvaget-Cahen, pp. 80-81. The standard work is Wilstenfeld-Mahler'sche
 Vergleichungstabellen ... , new edition by B. Spuler (Wiesbaden, 1961),
 cited as Wilstenfeld-Mahler.
The era most commonly used by the Jews of the Oeniza period was the
 "Era of the Documents," also called "Era of the Greeks," and by other
 names, and often simply "the era according to which we count here." Sci-
 entifically, it is known as the Seleucid era. It began in fall, 312 B.c.
Slightly less used was the era still in vogue in the Synagogue today, called
 "Era of the Creation," which starts with the year 3760 u.c. Thus, the year
1000 of the Christian era is 1311, Era of the Documents, and 4760, Era of
 the Creation.
Since the Jewish year begins in the fall (mostly in September), it never
 coincides with the Christian, which begins on January 1. Therefore, while
 converting Jewish into Christian dates, one must always pay attention to
the month and day. Thus, 1967 corresponds to 5727 of the Creation. But the
 first three months and fourteen days of 5727 still fell in 1966. The slight
discrepancies often found between dates provided in this book and those given
in catalogues or editions of Oeniza documents owe mostly to the fact that
 some previous authors disregarded this annoying difference (for reasons of
convenience or expediency, of course, not out of ignorance). In the many







cases in which only the year, but not the months and days, is indicated or
 preserved in a document, the Jewish year has to be rendered by two Chris-
tian years, for instance, 5727 1966-1967. =
 The Jewish and Muslim months are lunar, which means that they comprise
the time between one new moon and the other, a period of approximately
29-½ days. Therefore, both the Muslim and the Jewish years have 6 months
of 29 days and another 6 of 30 days. Since the Christian months are not
geared to the phases of the moon, they normally never coincide with the
Jewish and Muslim ones, and again, where the day is not indicated or pre-
served, a Jewish or Muslim month must be identified by two Christian ones.
Thus, the Jewish month of Nisan, 5727, corresponding exactly to the Muslim
month of Mul]arram, 1387, must be defined by April-May, 1967 (its actual
duration: April 11-May 10).
 In 1967, the correspondence of the Jewish and Muslim months is exact.
During the Geniza period, there often were discrepancies of one or two days,
and sometimes such discrepancies are expressly stated in a letter. Since the
Muslim calendar was fixed according to the actual observation of the moon,
while the Jewish calendar was astronomically fixed, such differences are not
surprising (but they exist also between Mahler and Wilstenfeld-Mahler, as
far as the Geniza period is concerned, as well as between Wilstenfeld-Mahler
and data provided in Geniza documents or Arabic literature. More serious is
the problem that in some cases a date in a Geniza. document, mentioned
together with the day of the week, differs from that calculated in Mahler.
Such baffling disagreements must be left to professional students of chronol-
ogy. They are touched on here only where they have relevance to the subject
matter discussed, as on page 289.
 The total of twelve lunar months is more than eleven days shorter than a
solar year. Since nature depends on the sun, the Jewish calendar adapts the
lunar to the solar year by adding a thirteenth month seven times in nine-
teen years, a process called intercalation. Therefore, many a Geniza docu-
ment defines a year as a period consisting of twelve months, namely when
a contract is made in or before such a "leap year" of thirteen months.
 The Muslim year, designated by the abbreviation A.H., has no intercala-
tion and therefore has no relation to nature whatsoever. Since the Muslim
states derived their revenue mainly from agriculture, they were forced to
adopt, in addition to the Muslim calendar, "financial" calendars of various
origins. The rents for houses and shops and the accounts of the merchants,
however, were all made according to the Muslim calendar. We are therefore
not surprised that the "financial year" has left no traces in the Geniza (cf.
pp. 208 and 269, above). The Muslim year, like the Jewish, never coincides
with the Christian and must be rendered by two Christian years wherever
month and day are not indicated. For instance, A.H. 1387 1967-1968.=
 All dates in this book, including the Coptic ones, are given according to
the present-day, so-called Gregorian, calendar, which was instituted in 1582,
centuries after the Geniza period. The dates found in the documents or
derived from them by circumstantial evidence are converted everywhere into
modern ("Gregorian") dates with the aid of Mahler or Wilstenfeld-Mahler.
In light of the explanations given above, one must allow for a margin of
slight differences.
 The Jewish, Muslim, and Oriental (also in general: ecclesiastic) Christian
day begins on the preceding evening. "The night of Saturday" means Friday







night. Consequently, the Sabbath and all holidays start on the evening of the
preceding days.


II. NAMES
 A person could be identified in many different ways, often used side by side
in the same document.
 1. His personal name. If he was Jewish this could be either Hebrew or
Arabic or both. In the last case, the meaning of the two names was, or was
supposed to be, the same and since the two languages are cognate, often
also the sound was similar: for example, Obadiah-'Abdalliih, "Servant of
God," Nethanel-Hibat Allah, "Gift of God," .Japheth-Hasan, "Handsome"
(in reality the Hebrew Japheth does not have this meaning}. Arabic names
were hebraized: Barakat-Berakhot, "Blessings," YalJyii-YiJJyii, "May he live."
The biblical name Eli, never used by Jews before Islam (because Eli, the
High Priest, was an ill-fated man [I Samuel 2 :30-36)), is the most common
name in the Geniza, becauae its spelling is identical with the Arabic 'Ali.
 2. A man's personal name followed by that of his father: for example,
Nahray hen (abbreviated here as b.) Nissim.
 3. The so-called kunya, a name composed with Abu (later often shortened
to Bii) *, originally meaning "father of," is mostly used to mean "possessor
of," "endowed with." Often, but not always, there exists some connection
between the kunya and the name: for instance, the Hebrew Yeshu'a (p. 364,
below), means "Salvation," and the Arabic kunya attached to it, Abu 'I-Faraj,
"endowed with salvation." 'Ariis (p. 194, above), is Arabic for "bridegroom,"
the kunya Abu 'l-Afrii.q means "endowed with happiness." A man called
Abraham would be called Abu Isl].ii.q, "Father of Isaac" ( p. 258, above), even
if he had no child at all, because the biblical patriarch had a son of that name.
 In ancient Arabic speech a person was addressed not by his name, but
by his kunya. Conversely, he would mention himself not by his kunya, but
by his name. In the Geniza period this usage was still alive, but not strictly
adhered to. Thus, the India trader Abu Zikri Kohen signed all his documents
in this way, while he was occasionally addressed by his personal name Judah
(p. 242, above).
 Persons are very often ref erred to solely by their kunya. This makes their
identification sometimes a hazardous task (see the remark about Abu 'I-Faraj,
 (p. 309, above).
 4. A Jew belonging to the priestly family of Aaron was called ha-Kohen,
"the priest," often abbreviated to Kohen (without the Hebrew article ha).
The tribal surname ha-Levi was rarely shortened in this way, presumably
because Levi was also a personal name.
 5. Family names, whether or not introduced by lbn. "son of," were very
common, but not general. As with our own family names, their origin was
variegated and derived from (a) the names of ancestors, in particular of
one who bore a title or a nickname, such as the Scholar (p. 238, above).
Miska, "the woman surnamed a piece of musk" (p. 365, below); (b) places,
for example, (al-) Halabi, from Aleppo; (c) professions, see, for instance,
page 80, above. •
• The u in the combinations Abu'l, Bu'l becomes short and is therefore
printed without a bar.







6. Honorary epithets conferred by rulers, the heads of the Jewish acade-
mies or local communities (as a reward for generous donations). Many per-
 sons accumulated quite a number of such epithets, as one does today with
 honorary degrees, but one of them often became the sole name by which a
 person normally was referred to, such as Sana' al-Mulk, "the Splendor of the
 Realm" (p. 253, above). Since the same honorary epithet was given at dif-
 ferent times and places to different persons, the student of the Geniza incurs
 here the same difficulty as in the identification of kunyas noted earlier.
7. Sobriquets of all descriptions, mostly humoristic, were common and also
 often became the single name by which a person was known. In legal docu-
 ments, where strict identification was necessary, sometimes the most deroga-
 tory nicknames are unabashedly listed. Such data are helpful, but also must
 be used with discretion, since, as we have noted, a sobriquet could become a
 family name and thus designate a person different from the one defined in
 a dated document.
 8. Taste and usage with regard to names changed considerably during the
 three hundred years or so of the "classical" Geniza period. In view of this,
 the names occurring in an otherwise undatable document sometimes can be
 used to approximate its period.







AppendixB
COINS, WEIGHTS, AND MEASURES




 I. COINS
1. The Muslim gold coin dinar continued the Roman-Byzantine monetary
system both in its name, which goes back to Latin denarius, and in its weight.
Its standard weight was 4.233 grams, and, as is proved by the hundreds of
pieces preserved, this weight was essentially maintained and the gold content
of the coins was excellent during most of the Fa timid period.
2. In view of the enormous difference between our way of life and stand-
ards of living and those of the Geniza people it is extremely difficult to gauge
the purchasing power of .a dinar. Several direct and indirect testimonies of
the Geniza prove that 2 dinars were regarded as a monthly income sufficient
for a lower middle class family. For the sake of illustration, it seems there-
fore permissible to equate the economic Yalue of a dinar with that of ap-
proximately a hundred U.S.A. dollars. More about this in .Mediterranean
 Society. Yolume IY, chapter ix. ·
3. In general, dinars struck in different cities under the various Fatimid
caliphs did not differ much in weight or alloy. Nor was there a perceptible
 difference between coins the legends of which were arranged in concentric
 circles and those that bore inscriptions in parallel lines. As the accounts of
the bankers and a great many allusions in letters prove, however; eaeh group
 of dinars had a separate rate of exchange (whieh kept the money changers
 in business). Cf. above, pages 236-240.
4. In Sicily and Tunisia mostly quarter dinars, weighing approximately 1
 gram, were struek. The tari of the Norman conquerors of southern Italy and
 Sicily was of the same type (seep. 237, above).
5. The other fractions of a dinar, continuously mentioned in letters and
 accounts, such as½,½,¾, ¼, as a rule, were not coins, but mostly represented
 money of aecount.
6. The dinar was divided into 24 carats ( qirat; the English is derived
 from the Arabir. which itself 11,:oes back to the Greek). The qiriit, too, was
 money of acrount. For the exceptional case where it appears as a coin, an
 explanation is tried in S. D. Goitein, "Bankers Accounts from the Eleventh
 Century," JESHO. 9 (1967), 53.
7. The qiriit was subdivided into three l}abbas, or grains, and six danaqs.
 In different areas and periods these subdivisions had varying values; those
 indicated here are the ones found in the Geniza documents. The ¼, ½2, and
 ¾u dinars mentioned in this book refer to qirats, ~abbas, and danaqs,
 respectively.







 8. The term mithqil (derived from the same Semitic root as biblical shekel
 and tekel) originally denotes the dinar as being of full weight. In the Geniza
 texts it is either synonymous with dinar or designates specific issues, mithqfil
 as a term being preferred in particular in Spain and Morocco.
9. The name for the silver coin, dirhem (as English dram going back
 ultimately to Greek drachme) was applied in three entirely different mean-
 ings:
(a) A full silver coin, called also fi#a, silver, or nuqra, pure silver. Nomi-
 nally, 13-½ dirhems of this type equaled 1 dinar.
(b) A coin of low silver content. Approximately 3 of them had the value
 of the nuqra and 36-40 that of the dinar. This coin is the dirhem normally
 referred to in the Geniza documents.
( c) Base local emissions of varying standards.
For details see Appendix D, below.
10. Fractions of the dirhem are constantly referred to. The kharrii.ba, or
 carob seed (the English is derived from the Semitic word) represented ½s
 of the dirhem, as in TS 16.39, I. 20. Normally, kharrf1ba is used (as we do
 ,vith penny) in the sense of a very small amount of money (usually which
 one does not have): l}abba, abO\·e, section 7, is used in the same sense.
11. Copper coins appear only in late Geniza texts and can be disregarded
 here. In view of this fact and the relative scarcity of silver coins found one
 wonders how people did their daily shopping, Glass weights of coins and
 other token money might have served as partial substitutes. More is said about
 this question in .Mediterranean Society, Volume III, chapter viii.



II. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
 1. Weights differed from place to place and from one commodity to an-
 other. To compound the confusion, as the Geniza texts show, one and the
 same commodity sometimes was traded in weights of different types.
 2. The basic weight was the dirhem (not to be confused with the coin
 bearing the same name) weighing 3.125 grams. The common pound of Fustat,
 ratl. consisted of 144 dirhems (or 12 ounces, iiqiya. of 12 dirhems), approxi-
 mately 450 grams, comparable to the prPsent day U.S.A. pound, and this
 coincidence is not fortuitous.
 3. One hundred pounds made a qintar (ultimately going back to the same
 Latin word for a hundred as our cent).
 4. Of the many local rnriations (many of which continued to exist right
 into the twentieth century) attention mmt be drawn to the pound of Damas-
 cus, whirh consisted of 600, and that of Jerusalem, which weighed 800
 dirhems.
 5. A weight much used in international trade was the mann (connected
 with the biblical mene [Daniel 5:25]), consisting of 2 pounds slightly lighter
 than the pound of Fustat. Nominally, this was the pound of Baghdad, com-
 prising only 130 grams. \Vhere Geniza texts permit us to check the dis-
 crepancy between 2 Egyptian pounds and the mann, we find the difference
 somewhat smaller than warranted by the nominal values. In t,rn comple-
 mentary documents from March, 1058, 139 ratl in TS 20.152, 1. 10, cor-
 respond to 74 mann in TS 12.5, I. 9.







 6. Besides local variations of the pound (and, of course, the qintar),
 there were those bearing the name of commodities, such as the pepper pound,
 the silk pound ( not in Hinz, Masse), oil pound ( neither in Hinz, nor in Groh-
 mann, Einfiihrung), or pounds named after persons, such as the very common
 Laythi, called after a former governor of Egypt, and pounds described simply
 as the large and the small (the latter, latif, not in Hinz or Grohmann). With
 a few exceptions (such as those just indicated), the weights of the various
 types of pounds and qintars, mentioned in the Geniza documents, that is,
 the number of dirhems contained in each of them, were noted by Muslim
 antiquarians and are listed in the modern books of Islamic metrology.
 7. When various quantities of one and the same commodity, such as
 indigo, were weighed, according to the same document, in different types
 of weight (pepper, large, and Laythi), perhaps several qualities of that com-
 modity were involved. Or may we assume that the sellers simply weighed
 with the weights they happened to possess? An example in TS 12.284•.
 8. In 90 percent of the cases, at least, the pound or qintar referred to is
 not defined. Whether or not under such circumstances the standard pound
 of ca. 450 grams or another one related to the commodity mentioned is
 intended, is a question to which the future student of economic history will
 have to pay attention.
 9. Concerning camel loads and ship bales see pages 335 ff., above.
10. Grain was not weighed, but measured. The wayba comprised about 15
 liters (approximately 4 gallons) and the irdabb consisted of 6 waybas. There
 is no need to treat here the many measures for oil and wine mentioned in
 the Geniza documents.







 Appendix C
INDUSTRIAL PARTNERSHIPS




 (Bee chap. ii, sec. 2, pp. 81-89.)
 Unless indicated otherwise, all documents were written in Fustat.

 1. TS 13 J 1, f. 3. September 15, 1016. {Heb.)Dyeing.
 'Ammar b. Joseph, the dyer, releases his partner Samuel ha-Kohen b.
Moses b. f?emalJ. of all obligations resulting from their terminated partner-
ship and also declares not to have any claims on the sums still due the part-
nership in Malij (six debtors are mentioned by name). The lengthy document
was written on the eve of the Day of Atonement certainly because people
from Malij, where the workshop was operated, had come to Fustat for the
High Holiday and were able to witness the release. The document is signed
by nine witnesses (not six, as in Mann, I, 38 n. 1).
2. Bodi. MS Heb. c 28 (Cat. 2876), f. 32. November 30, 1076. Minting.
 Man~ur b. Khalaf of Tyre (Lebanon) undertakes to work for a full year
in partnership with Japheth b. Abraham and Solomon b. Abraham (not rela-
tives). He will receive half the profit and the two others the other half; he
promises not to interrupt his work by travel and to pay 20 dinars even for
the mere request of being permitted to travel in order to see his children
and wife.
 The first page of the contract where the nature of the work concerned was
indicated has not been preserved, but in another document, TS 16.148, dated
1086, Man~iu sifts gold dust for Japheth b. Abraham, who appears there
as mutawalli 'diir al-<f,arb, administrator of the mint. Thus it is likely that
the work here also was connected with minting, the two partners providing
the materials, or standing security to the government for Ma~iir, while the
latter provided the labor.
 The document will be published by A. Udovitch.
3. TS 28.6, sec. B (upside down). June, 1079. Weaving.
 Lengthy but incomplete draft in which Abraham Kohen b. Daniel releases
his former partner Obadiah, called also 'Abdallah, b. Meshullam of Tyre,
from all obligations resulting from their partnership, promises to pay a sum
still owed by them, and permits him in future to trade, to work in weaving,
and to conclude partnerships with others.
4. TS 12.606. Around 1085.Lead workshop.
 End of a deathbed declaration of one of three partners in a lead workshop.
The lead, as well as three other materials specified as belonging to the part-
ners in common, and the sums due them, were listed by the dying man in







his account book. Each owed one-third of the working implements. One as-
set was shared by the testator and the partner, Abu 'I-Khayr, to the exclu-
sion of the third partner who happened to be the testator's brother, another
again was shared differently. Abu '1-Khayr is also appointed as executor of
the will.
 The date of the document is not preserved. It is in the handwriting of
Hillel b. Eli (dated documents 1066-1107) and signed by the judge Abra-
ham, son of Isaac, the Scholar (1050-1093). Hillel's handwriting changed
slightly during the years. Our document belongs to his middle period.
5. TS 20.110 *. August-September, 1086. Weaving.
 Nethanel, also called Hibat Allah, of Jerusalem, b. Yeshii'a, a weaver, con-
cludes a partnership with Sedaqa, Member of the Academy, b. Muvl]ar for
an unlimited period of time. Nethanel contributes 15 dinars, Sedaqa 50;
profit and loss will be borne in equal shares. Nethanel will sell ·the fabrics
woven by him solely in the exchanges of the clothiers. If he wishes to termi-
nate the partnership, he has to announce this two months in advance and
to pay back the capital invested with him in cash.
6. TS 10 J 27, f. 3, sec. 3 *. July 17, 1107. Cairo. Tailoring (Embroidery).
 Eli b. Mevasser pays 1 dinar and Nethanel b. Tiqva 10 dinars and will
add more as soon as the shop "turns." Eli will do the tailoring (which con-

7. ENA 4011, f. 57. June-July, 1125.Bakery.
 Draft, or rather instruction, written by the judge Nathan ha-Kohen b.
Solomon (dated documents 1122-1150), concerning a partnership in a bakery,
in which Hiba and Miisa b. Bishr invested work in equal shares while the
capital, 4 dinars, was provided by Abu '1-Riqa, the shomer (Heb.), or super-
visor of ritual purity. When the bakery went bankrupt, Musa consented to
pay 3 dinars and Hiba 1. According to TS K 15, f. 5, 600 loaves of bread,
weighing 600 pounds, cost 3 dinars.

 Shemarya ha-Kohen b. Manasse, known as Abu '1-Wafa b. al-Naqid, re-
leases Abu 'I-Muna Isaac b. Judah of Damascus and his son Abu 'I-Karam
from all obligations resulting from a partnership in the manufacturing of
glass vessels, which was done in a store of copperware in the Street of the
Coppersmiths belonging to Shemarya. The release was granted, after Isaac
paid 1 dinar out of 9-¼ demanded by Shemarya. The intervening elders ob-
viously were convinced that the Damascene glassmaker was unable to pay
more.
9. Bodi. MS Heb. a 3 (Cat. 2873), f. 8 *. December 3, 1134.Gla.sswork.
 Abii Sahl Manasse b. Eli ha-Levi, after having received a loan of 10 dinars
from Nethanel b. Joseph, known as Abu Sa'd the Glassmaker, against which
he deposits with him t~e title deeds of his house, concludes with him a part-
nership in the manufacture of glass vessels, for a period of six-and-a-half
months. The capital, 20 dinars, is exclusively provided by Nethanel, who
will work only two days a week, while Manasse will provide the rest of the
skilled labor. All expenses, such as material, fuel and the payment of a
journeyman, will be borne by the partnership. Whenever one of the partnen
takes out money for his private needs, the same sum will be withdrawn by
the other partner. After the lapse of six-and-a-half months, Manasse has







 first to return the IO dinars lent to him. In case no profit is made, the loan
 has to be returned during the course of one year, failing which, Nethanel
 will indemnify himself from Manasse's house.
 The deed was signed only four-and-a-half months after it was written, that
 is, only two months before the partnership was due to expire. Most probably,
 the rabbinical court had doubts whether the contract did not contain an
 element of "usury," or taking interest.

 10. TS 10 J 9, f. 30. August, 1136.Wine-making.
 The upper, lower, and left parts of the document have been torn away.
 From the text preserved these facts emerge: Four partners joined in the
 production of wine with the enormous sum of 1,510 dinars, of which Nethanel,
 known as Abu Sa'd the Glassmaker, contributed 400. Another partner, Sedaqii
 b. Bunan, pays 100; the name of the main capitalist and the sum contributed
 by him arc not fully preserved, but I suspect that he paid 1,000 dinars while
 the manager, Yeshu'a b. Japheth, known as Abu 'I-Faraj b. Abu '1-Husayn,
 participated only with the token sum of 10 dinars. The manager received
 one-third of the profit, the investors two-thirds. Only the manager was re-
 sponsible to the farmers of the tax on wine production ( cf. above, p. 270).
 Receipts from the government treasury testifying to the payment of the tax
 were produced by him. He was obliged also not to engage in any trade of
 wine outside the partnership. The document is a release in which all partners
 express their satisfaction with having received all due to them. A sum of
 "540 dinars, including the taxes," mentioned on the reverse side, 1. 2, seems
 to represent the income after the return of the capital invested.

 Note in the handwriting of judge Nathan b. Samuel (dated documents

 yid al-Ahl b. Hiba, takes as partner Faral] b. Abu 'l-'Ala. The inventory of
 the pharmacy was worth 7 dinars, Faral] contributed 20 dinars, of which he
 paid 16 immediately, promising the rest for later. Sayyid al-Ahl reserved for
 himself the right to sell on his own account a popular medicine making
 women stout (the desired ideal of female beauty), qirtiis al-taliyij, modern
 ta[iawig,* although the material for this medicine would be taken from the
 common stock. This was his compensation as manager of the store. He also
 would dispense tooth powder, eye powder, and arsenic on his own account,
 the materials of which, however, he was obliged to buy himself. Each partner
was allowed a per diem of 1-½ dirhems. Duration: one year.

 Ji ~abgh al-arjawiin wa-'amalih, for dyeing and manufacturing purple cloth.
After their return to Fustat and the dissolution of the partnership, long dis-
putes arose between them. These were finally settled, and our document deals
with a debt of 2 dinars remaining on one partner to the other. He undertook
to pay 1 dinar in each of the months following the settlement under penalt.y
of paying to the community the equivalent of any sum he might fail to pay. On
the reverse side, three installments of 24, 8-½, and 9-½ dirhems are entered
without date, and only in summer, 1144, eight months after the settlement,

was the debt finally paid. Written in the difficult hand of Nathan b. Samuel
(see preceding item), who wrote also the entry about the final payment, but
had it signed by three other judges. This shows perhaps that the purple-dyers
were rather tough people. Introducing the settlement, he writes indeed: after
litigations, which to report would take too much time.

Jewish and Muslim craftsmen (silversmithing or glasswork) formed a part-
 nership, their implements being common property, on condition that profits
 made on Fridays belonged to the Jews and those made on Saturday accrued
 to the Muslims. The query inquires whether this was permissible since the
implements in which the Jews had half a share were thus put to work on
Saturday. The answer was in the affirmative. The question seems to assume
 that these Muslims did not work on their weekly day of worship. Friday,
 of course, is not a day of rest for Muslims (cf. Goitein, Studies, pp. 111-125).
 Questions about partnerships between Jews and Muslims are found in re-
 sponsa directed to other rabbinical authorities (cf. the notes to the Mai-
 monides text quoted).

 to the second half of the twelfth century or the first half of the thirteenth.
 The text is a copy, made for one of the partners, not an original, and is

 before Muslim courts. The incomplete court record contains references to
 hides worth 17 dinars, allegedly taken by one partner, and to 35 dinars in
 cash which another claimed to have paid to one of his fellow partners. The
 document, signed by the local judge, Gamliel b. Siml]a ("Joy") shows that

 AppendixD
THE EXCHANGE RATE OF GOLD AND
SILVER MONEY




 Gold coins were the standard money in Fa timid times (969-1171) .1 "The
rate of exchange is 36" means that for 1 dinar one received 36 dirhems at
the time when that remark was made. This rate was in constant fluctuation,
caused partly by deterioration of the silver content, partly by the fact that
during most of this period silver money was imported to Egypt and Tunisia
and not coined there, and partly by secondary agents, such as hoarding in
time of panic or calamity. Modern research has done much to clarify the
general course of the monetary history of the High Middle Ages. 2 The data
assembled here from the Geniza provide a more detailed picture of the rela-
tionship between gold and silver coins, the knowledge of which is indispensa-
ble for the proper understanding of texts referring to economic matters.
 This relationship between gold and silver money is illustrated in the Geniza
papers in various ways. Often, the official (or rather: market) rate of ex-
change is explicitly stated, sometimes accompanied by a remark about the
high or low value of silver at that time. In other cases we read about actual
transactions of exchange made, or of rates stipulated in contracts. Occa-
sionally, the market price and the actual rate of exchange obtained are
indicated together. In still other cases we are able to calculate the rate from
other data provided. Finally, remarks in a letter about economic conditions
in general are likely to explain the reason for a high or low rate of exchange
mentioned in it.
 Most of this material was published by me in JESHO, 8 {1965), 1-46, ac-
companied by notes from the pens of Dr. George C. Miles and Professor Paul
Balog. These notes are included here in abbreviated form and marked with
M. and B. respectively. In conclusion, the meaning and significance of the
data presented are briefly evaluated.
 The two numbers, separated by : , at the end of the first line of each
section summarize the exchange rate discussed in it, for example 1 :30 in sec-
tion 1 means that 1 dinar was worth 30 dirhems.
 1. TS 16.105. Fustat, March 26, 986.1 :30.
 A marriage contract, in which the bridegroom gives to his bride, a freed-
woman, 12-½ silver pieces (zuz, Heb.), due to her according to Jewish law,
adding to them, as was usual, a voluntary bridal gift, consisting of 5 dinars,
which were given to her at the time of the contract, and 15 dinars to be







paid "later" (the mu'akhkhar, which was paid at the husband's death or
at a divorce). On her side, she brought ln a marriage portion of 45 dinars,
a very high sum for a freedwoman (her former master was of a noble and
rich family). The marriage portion, like the mu'akhkhar, had to be res-
tituted to the wife after the death of the husband or at the time of divorce.
The total of the bridal gift and the marriage portion is assessed as follows:
 60 gold pieces (i.e., 45, the marriage portion, plus 15, the mu'akhkhar)
 162-½ silver pieces (i.e., 12-½ plus 150, representing 5 dinars).
 At first glance, such a low value of the silver at such an early period is
rather surprising. Muqaddasi, p. 240, reports, however, that some time after
the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, the value of the dirhem was low (see Balog,
"History," p. 115). This might be reflected here.
(Probably fractional dirhems, such as ½-dirhem pieces, which then made
the bulk of the circulation, are intended [Miles, Fatimid Coins, nos. 116-124]
M.B.)
 2. TS Arabic Box 30, f. 284. Fustat, April, 1003.1:37.7.
 A day-to-day account of the income of a textile store for the months
Jumada I and II of the Muslim year 393. After the lapse of two-and-a-half
weeks or so, the junior partner or employee changed the silver receiverl into
gold and handed it over to the senior partner or employer. 245 dirhems made
 6.5 dinars and, two weeks later, 187.5 dirhems 5 dinars. =
According to Maqrizi's Treatise on the Famines, trans. G. Wiet in JESHO,
5 (1962), 15 ff., Sauvaire, p. 276, Balog, History. p. 115, a serious crisis of the
 dirhem started in A.H. 395 (began on Oct. 8, 1004), until it reached the bot-
 tom of 1:34 in 397 (began on Sept. 27, 1006). It could not have been caused,
 as Maqrizi suggests, by the low level of the Nile in 395, since it is already
 evident in 393. Our document does not comment on the low rate of the
 dirhem.
 (Also possibly fractions of dirhems are intended [Miles, Fatimid Coins,
 nos.176-191]. M.B.)

 The rate of exchange officially fixed prior to this date was 1:18 (cf. Balog,
 History, p. 115). Tunisia, at that time, as its coins prove, belonged monetarily
 to the Fa timid empire (see Idris, Zirides, p. 539).

 257-258] M.)
3a. TS 16.374. Ed., see Shaked, Bibliography, p. 71. 1022. 1:24.
A marriage contract from Mastaura, Asia Minor. The money concerned
 is, of course, Byzant:ne. The document is quoted here for the sake of com-
 pleteness. The bridal gift of 200 ziiz of silver is described as being worth 8-¾
 dinars (the Hebrew dinar is used). 24 Byzantine silver kerations correspond
 indeed to one chrysun or gold piece (cf. A. Andreades, Byzantion, 1 [1924],
 79). T. Reinach, however, who discusses this detail in Melanges Schlumberger
(Paris, 1924), pp. 131-132, comes to the conclusion that the definition given
 refers to the time of the emperor Constantine and not to A.D. 1022. In cor-
 roboration of Reinach's thesis it should be noted that in the later part of the
 contract, the chrysun is referred to with the Hebrew word ziihuv, gold piece,
 and not with dinar. On the other hand, one has always to keep in mind that
 the medieval scribes regarded inconsistency-or perhaps: variations-in the
 use of terms as a virtue rather than a vice.
4. TS 13 J 8, f. 2. Tunisia, summer, 1029.1:12?
A document issued in Tunisia (Qayrawan or al-Mahdiyya) in Tammuz
(began on June 15, 1029) and quoted in a court record of Fustat. "A debt
 of 280 silver pieces (kesiifim, Heb.), one piece being worth two qirats."
In the whole of the Geniza, which is permeated by Tunisian material, I
 have never come across the term "qirat" in the meaning of half a dirhem.
 It wouk: also have been a tautology to say that 1 dirhem equals 2 half dir-
 hems. According to Idris, Ziddes, p. 641, however, qirat was used in this sense
 in that country. Since several emissions of silver used to be current in Tu-
 nisia (see below), the definition "worth two qirats" refers perhaps to the
 standard half dirhem. Otherwise the reference is to gold qirats and the rate
 was 1 :12, which was quite common for full value silver coins (cf. below, sec.
 24 and elsewhere).
(According to a communication from Professor P. Grierson, these coins
 probably were Byzantine miliaresia, regularly worth 2 carats. The merchants
 were using foreign money.)

 5. TS 12.282. Vellum. Qayrawan, ca. 1005-1035. 1 :17 and regarded as low.
 The writer of this only partly preserved letter was one of the Taherti
brothers of Qayrawan, about whom see page 181, above. He reports about
a consignment of silver money (' Aziziyya and Mu'izziyya dirhems are men-
tioned) worth the enormous sum of 1,230 dinars. (These must be North Afri-
can Fatimid fractional dirhems. M.) Near the end of the letter he says:
"wa-si'r al-fi</4a hahunii ya sayyidi al-manbii.t 1'l ghayr diiniq li'ann dariihim
al-Andal11S kathira wa-kull al-as'iir taqif 'alayha." "The price of silver here,
my lord, namely the coined one, is 17 less one daniq, for the dirhems of Spain
are plenGy and all the prices are based on them." (It is interesting that
Spanish dirhems circulated in Qayrawan. The output of dirhems by the
Unayyads of Spain was tremendous. M.)
 For manbut, cf. manbit. "argent," Dozy, Supplement, p. 634a, and munab-







bat, "embossed," Steingass, Persian-English Dictionary, p. 1320. I take it as
coined silver, as against silver vessels, which were traded according to weight
and normally obtained a price lower than the equivalent weight of coins. In
any case, the context shows that dirhems are intended here. For the rate
1 : 17, see also µage 388, below.
6. TS 12.367. Vellum. Tunisia, ca. 1005-1035. 1 :27.
In a report about the prices of commodities {presumably in Qayrawan):
wal-firJ<J,a kiisida wal-iiarf 27. "Silver sells badly. The rate of exchange is 27."
This does not mean that 1 :27 was regarded as either high or low. Com-
modities are sometimes expressly reported in these letters as selling badly,
irrespective of their prices.
7. Mosseri L 52•. Alexandria, ca. 1005-1035. 1:33-½.
It was winter, many ships were under repair and many travelers were de-
tained in the city along with five thousand bales of merchandise. The price of

man from Tripoli, as usual in that place, writes s for~) 33 wa-nif bilii (thus,
not: illii) J.iabba. "The rate of exchange is 33-½ approximately." With this
s;atement the letter concludes.
"Without a l}abba" cannot mean: "less one l,iabba" for this coin through-
out the Geniza documents is ½2 of a dinar, and not a fraction of a dirhem.
I take bila J.iabba as being the opposite of l}abba l}abba, "exactly," a very
common phrase.
8. TS 12.124•. Vellum. Tunisia, ca. 1005-1035.1 :40-½.

metal value for founding. I sold what I had for 110 per dinar. Do not buy
anything of that stuff." Later in the letter he remarks that he had sent to
the addressee 200 excellent Maghrebi (dirhems) to cover the expenses for a
bale of merchandise forwarded from Alexandria to al-Mahdiyya. According
to the exchange rate for good Maghrebi dirhems indicated in the letter, this
would amount to about 3.3 dinars, a reasonable amount for expenses on an
average bale sent from Alexandria to Tunisia. (Probably, the base Hammudid
dirhems of Sabta [Ceuta] are intended. See Miles, Coins of the Spanish
Muluk al-Tawa'if. M.)

 Long letter by the senior partner, Barhun Tiiherti (see sec. 11). As usual,
 the letter is dated by day and .Jewish month. Moreover, it refers to terrible
 news brought hy the fuyilj, the mail couriers, at the same time expressing
 consolation that Abu Na~r is still alive. The reference is without doubt to
 the murder of Abu Sa'd, the "vizier" of the Fatimid dowager queen, on
 Sunday, Oct. 25, 1047, who was survived, albeit only for a comparatively
 short period, by his brother Abu Na§r.3
 After mentioning a consignment of 30 dinars, the writer continues in lines
19-22: "In a previous letter I had announced that I sent you one thousand
 dirhems with Abu Bakr al-Rashidi. Later, however, he refused to carry them
 and I changed them for you into these 30 dinars" (1000:30 33-¼).=

dirhems. This presupposes a rate of exchange of I: 45. Had the quality of

have failed to comment upon it.
The letter refers to hadhihi 'l-sana al-~a'ba, "this hard year."
 (Earlier and better coins of the same ruler circulated concurrently with
later, worse ones, hence the different exchange rates in one year [see secs. 13

Containing also rates of exchange for several local emissions.
An account submitted to the same addressee by the brother of Barhiin
'.fii.herti, containing four references to rates of exchange. The account is
divided by horizontal lines into six sections (A-F).
A, ll. 3-4: 14-% diniir yajib lahii ljarf waqt awu·al bay' al-liik 60 bi-dinar,
yajib laha 880 dirham. "14-% dinars make 880 dirhems, the rate of exchange
being at the time of the first sale of the lacquer 60."
C, 11. 11-12: "Half a bale of cowrie shells was sold after the death of our
 relative for 11,000 dirhems. At that time, the ~arf was 260. But I reckon it
at its value today, namely the coinage of 'Azzun, which has a fineness of
one and a quarter (<Jarb 'Azzun 'iyiir 1-¼), worth 200 per dinar, proceeds
55 dinars" (11,000:200 55).=
D. "The following is the sum of the dirhems of low value (al-waraq al-
ghayr muthmina): 14,055. The first to be received was the coinage of Hashim
lsfi.4 Before it had come dirhems 'exposed to the sun' ( mushammasa) .5 At
the arrival of the lacquer, the price of the mushammasa had already been
fixed, namely at 110 per dinar and the price of Hashim's coinage, 140. We
assume now that the two emissions had been mixed, although each emission
should be evaluated according to the actual coins (wa-kayf an ma yubkam fi
 kull waqt illii bil-dirham aUadhi yu<J,rab}.6 However, as a matter of precaution 1
I regard them as mixed, which would make 125 per 1 dinar and for these
 14,055 dirhems-112 dinars."
The orphans of the relative referred to as having died shortly before are
involved here. For both religious and humanitarian reasons one had to be
extremely careful not to take from orphans more than they owed. Therefore,
 the writer prefers to give them the benefit of the doubt.
F. "He owes you expenses for the daughter of his sister for the [,Jewish]
year 815 (Sept. 5, 1054, to Sept. 24, 1055, a leap year of 13 months) 630
dirhems of the coinage of Khalliif, having today a rate of exchange of 1 :50
and this is at present the currency (jaw<iz) of Qayrawan. Howe,·er, at the
 time when the money was spent on her, the rate of exchange was 35 [the
 reading 5 is not certain]. We reckon it at its present value. Thus, there has to
 be paid for them 12-½ dinars. Subsequently, you spent for his niece 1,370
dirhems, from various emissions (literally: foundings, sabk) which we reckon
 at a rate of 137, which makes 10 dinars. Total 22-½ dinars. In fact, owing to
the circumstances, in addition to the 10, 40 more dinars were spent on her.''
The concluding sentence seems to mean that others had spent for the orphan
far more than the addressee.
 (One would expect the coinages of 'Azzfm nnd Khnllflf to be Zirid cur-
rencies. But we know of almost no Zirid dirhems [see Hnznrd, Numismatfo

reported that the prices of Egyptian flax had risen in "Sicily" [i.e., Palermo],
the letter continues:) "The prices of our own city follow no principle [i.e.,
are not steady]. Even the rate of exchange one day is over 17 and similarly
becomes less than that-all according to demand." In another part of the
letter, it was explained that the country was "weak" and therefore even a
small change in supply upset the prices. Cf. page 220, above.
 Unfortunately, the last but one word before the number 17 is effaced. One
expects "the rate of exchange rises by. . . ." In case our reading and
interpretation are correct, the apparent contradiction between the two pas-
sages would find its explanation in the context. The first statement is
preceded by references to purses (~urra) with thousands of dirhems sent to
the addressee, who, of course, was aware of the fact that those were low-value
dirhems. The second statement, then, would refer to full-silver dirhems
 =
 (3 X I 7 51). In addition, line IO contains the following remark: wa-raja'
al-'iyar bi-Sfiiq~ 8, literally: "The fineness [of the silver dirhem] in Sfax
again has become three," that is, 3 low-value dirhems were accepted for 1 full-
silver coin, a remark that had its reason in the fact that the relationship of
the two types of silver money was by no means steady (see p. 388, below).
 25. TS 16.279, Nahray 196. Tunisia, ca. 1058-1059. Local emission 1 :1,000.
 At the beginning of the letter, the writer refers to the death of the most
honored member of the community, Barhfm b. Musa Tiiherti (see sec. 23),
which came shortly after the sack of Qayrawiin in 1057 (in which the writer
was even robbed of his clothing).
 L. 15; "I have sent you a bag (kharita), with 1,424 old dirhems, worth
approximately 8 one-and-a-half dinars. Please find a way (tab,tal) for ex-
changing them at any rnte appenring to you ns reasonable nnd send me a little
flax, so that I mny make me some clothing, for I ha\'e come here [presumably:
al-Mahdiyya] only with a curtain of canrns (killat khaysh) on my head and
around my waist, and [send me] a pair of shoes for iny feet, wide around the







 ankles and strong, as well as some Tall.ii paper 9 so that I may be able to
 write a letter to Baghdad or to Palestine."
The writer was a scholar who corresponded with the Jewish academies in
 Baghdad and Jerusalem. His letter is a moving illustration of the disaster
 wrought on the local population by the invasion of "the lfiiiizis," as the Hila!
 and Sulaym are referred to in the Geniza.
In sec. 26 we find an even lower rate of exchange for a local emission.

 Local emission 1 :less than 200. 1: 1,600 (later).
Both the writer and the addressee of this letter occur frequently in the
 Geniza. Its content, compared with that of other letters, fixes its time at the
 period indicated above.
"I went down to Si1sa to see the family. The consignment that I had
 brought was sold (during my absence). The rate of exchange had been less
 than 200. Then, while my dirhems were there, the rate went down to 1,600
 per dinar, thus I got for a dinar a qiriit.''
The last statemen~ is to be taken with a grain of salt, of course. He received
 1/s, not ¥.H, of the normal worth of his dirhems. Such a great and sudden
 devaluation can be explained perhaps by those dirhems being taken out of
 circulation.

 A long letter of eight~· lin<'s by an Andalusian residing in Tunisia, writing
 to another Andalusian, a relatiw, so_iournin~ in Egypt. Both are well known
 from many other letters. Despite this and the many names and other details
 mentioned in the letter, its exart time has not yet been found out.. The
 following quotation perhaps mi!!;ht be h<'lpful for doser identification:
 LI. 65-6S: ;/The l'ity wns dead [there was no busines:s] because of our beinji?

thank God, in good shape: low prices, seeurity. and a sultan who has mercy
with the people, may God ha,·e mercy with him and keep him for us and for
 this blessed frontier seaport (thaghr)."
The reference to the sultan gin•s the impression of a new ruler, who
 could only be Tamim, who succeeded his father :Mu'izz in 1062. In 1063, he







was attacked by Hammu al-Barghawiiti of Sfax, who had paid homage to the
J!ammadite al-Nii§ir and came within six or eight miles of al-Mahdiyya (cf.
Idris, Zirides, pp. 255-256). Our letter could well allude to this war which
occurred at the very beginnir1g of Tamim's rule. No Italian or Norman ships
are known to have troubled al-Mahdiyya in the early years of Tamim (cf.
Idris, Zirides, pp. 283 ff.), and wintertime anyhow would not have been
suitable for an attack by sea.
 The following detail also might be indicative of the period. Margin, I. 4:
"I have changed the Mahdiyya money into Sicilian quarter dinars, for I have
no hope that the former is current in Egypt (takhruj 'indkum)."
 L. 68: wa-si'r al-fi<j,if,a el-nuqra 'indna 22 drh' bi-din'. "The price of nuqra

worth two [or two-and-a-half] dinars." The unusual dot above the line
might serve as a symbol for ½. Normally, other signs were used to express
that fraction.
 30. TS 16.13. Tunisia, ca. 1040-1070. 1: 11-½ less one kharrflba.
 A letter from Palermo, Sicily, addressed to Joseph b. Musa Tii.herti in Egypt
(cf. sec. 24), and reporting about sales made in Tunisia: wa-kan bi't al-fi<J,rf,a
si'r 11-½ illa kharru(ba) bi-din'. ~a{i{i waznha 332 wa-rub(') ~a{i{i fiha ba'd
al-ju'l 95 ruba'i. "I sold the silver at the price of 11-½ less one kharruba per
dinar. The weight of the silver was 332-¼. Price obtained after the deduction
of the commission, 95 quarter dinars."
 According to the exchange rate, approximately 29 dinars (332-¼: 11-¼) were
obtained, which would make around 115 quarters and not 95, as stated here.
A commission of 20 out of 115 quarter dinars is out of the question .. Thus the
rubii.'is presumably had a higher value at that time than the dinars, which
occasionally occurred. I should like to remark that the letter is written in an
exceptionally beautiful and clear hand and there is no doubt whatsoever about
the words or the numerals.

are referred to.)

 LI. 31-36. The editors took rubii'iyya as meaning "city square," which
 caused much confusion among scholars engaged in the study of the historical
 topography of Jerusalem. In fact, it means simply "quarter dinars" and the
 purport of the text is as follows: Although the exchange rate of the dinar
 was 36-½, the writer received for the ruba'is of his busin~ss friend only 20
 dirhems per dinar, because they had lost their normal appearance; wa-qad

This is a letter from Tunisia, sent to Nahray when he was at the height
 of his career. Among many other consignments, 20 dinars are sent as a pay-







 ment for 1,000 dirhems, which N ahray had dispatched to Tunisia, because
 they obtained there a higher price than in Egypt. This means, that in Egypt
 he had to pay considerably more than 50 dirhems for 1 dinar.
Normally, si1ver money was sent from Tunisia to Egypt, not the other
 way.

This slump of the dirhem in Fustat, according to this writer, who had
 just arrived from Alexandria, clearly owed to a specific local situation. It is
 interesting to note that the report seems to assume that the city had to rely
 for its steady supply of good silver money on the country and the province.

 accustomed to such local money of low value.

 risen. 100 are worth 8 to 8 less one eighth. I worked hard and searched for

 Lebdi [silver coins] for about 140 dinars."
This statement presupposes that of dirhems which were not nuqra (i.e.,
 full silver) at least ~O had to be given for I dinar.
 (By this time, the dirhem must be Muriibit. In the twelfth century, at
 least until toward the end, there is evidently no silver east of the Maghreb,
 not even in Seljuk lands. M.)

 I take this as meaning that the writer had to buy the dirhems at a high

 An extended fragment (about 1,300 words) of a letter to Halfon hen
Nethanel, the India merchant, from his brother Ezekiel. The paragraph con-
cerned is a complicated report about the sale of a great quantity of Sicilian
cheese, effected in a dar wakiila (see p. 187, above). The price was to be
paid after four months. The buyer took a loan of 50 dinars from a banker
"at the rate of exchange of 1 :35."
 Does this mean that, in those days, silver, and not gold, was the standard?
Or, did the banker, while granting the loan, reckon the dinar as being worth
only 35 dirhems, when, in reality, it was worth 40 dirhems or more? See,
however, the following items. See sec. 55, below.

"'Awiig received one gold dinar at the rate of 42 silver pieces (dinar ayn

Here, as in sec. 51 we sec the dinar defined by an amount of low-value
 silver pieces.
The future student of this document should pay attention to the fact that
 in it dirham is used in two dilferent meanings, as a coin and as a weight.
The account contains another statement that might indicate a quite dif-
 ferent rate of exchange. It deals with the sale of ten pounds of silk costing
 10 dinars (half the standard price) and of which 4 dinars had been paid.
 For the exchange of these 4 dinars (which the writer obviously had paid in
 silver), an agio of 6 dirhems waraq had to be added. After noting this, the
 account continues: "He [the seller of the silk] had received 2 l].abbas more
 than 4 dinars, which makes 1-½." The latter amount can be only in silver
 dirhems. A l].abba is one-third of a qirat and ½2 of a dinar; ¾2 dinar=½
 dirhems would represent an exchange of 1: 54 approximately.

 List of contributors to a collection, written in the unmistakable hand of

 temporary with sec. 56 and represents the collection made in the capital,
 complementing the one made in the province. For it differs from all the
many others found in the Geniza with regard to Fustat by the high sums
recorded and by the fact that the collection was made during fourteen days,
at least, details concerning the first, second, thirteenth, and fourteenth days
 having been preserved (see p. 78, above). As far as extant, the list enu-
merates fifty contributions made in dinars, twelve in waraq and two in dirhems.
It seems, however, that there was no difference between these two terms for
silver money.
 The rate of exchange obviously was 39-½-40 per dinar, for the waraq con-
tributions of individuals amounted to 10, 19-½, 19-¾, 20 (four cases), 30,
and 39 dirhems, clearly equivalents for ¼, ½, ¾, and 1 dinar, respectively.

 the correspondence of the days of the weeks and the months.
 The community paid the poll tax for the ritual slaughterer as for other
 communal officials. As his occupation brought an income, he had to return to
 the community what it had outlaid for him, in the case concerned, 65 dir-
 hems for 1-¾ dinars, which is most clumsily specified as follows:

11arf 40.
 One is tempted to surmise that the actual rate of exchange was lower,
say: 1:36, and that a higher one was stipulated in these two cases, because
a longer delay of payment was granted to those two buyers than was usual.
No remark to this effect is made, however, and one has to bear in mind that
the scribes of the Geniza documents usually were not very methodical. It
may well be that while jotting down the two items concerned someone re-
marked that it was necessary to define the value of the dinar. The copyist
noted the rate of exchange twice and then stopped doing so.

 The following four examples do not allow definite conclusions as to the

are quoted here because they presuppose a generally accepted rate of ex-
change at the time of their writing.







62. Bodi. MS Heb. d 61, f. 9 (Cat. 2859 no. 3a). Fustat, March 27, 1100.
Joseph, the son of Joseph, the milkman, labban, receives from the "money
 of the poor" 1 dinar as loan, to be paid back in weekly installments of 2
 dirhems. A tenn is set for the beginning of the repayment, but not for its
 end.
The document is written and signed 12 by Isaac b. Samuel, the Sefaradi
 (the Andalusian), an outstanding judge and scholar, and two other com-
 petent persons, and utmost care was taken with money destined for the
 poor. Therefore, the absence of a term for the end of the payments is an
 indication of the existence of a fixed relationship between gold and silver
 around 1100.
63. TS 13 J 3, f. 23. Bilbays in Lower Egypt, September, 1215.
A Maghrebi living in this provincial town claims from his fiancee after the
 dissolution of the engagement a sum of over 4 dinars which he allegedly had
 spent on her in cash and food. She is prepared to swear that she had re-
 ceived not more than 48 dirhems. After the intervention of "righteous elders"
 a settlement is reached in which she agrees to acknowledge a debt of 58
 dirhems.
It would be erroneous to conclude that 58 dirhems corresponded to any-
 thing near the original claim of over 4 dinars. The parties in a lawsuit occa-
 sionally made ridiculously exaggerated claims and were not ashamed to settle
 finally with a small fraction of the sum they demanded first.
64. TS NS J 412. Fustat, August 18, 1217. 1:40?
A divorcee renounces 5 out of 15 dinars that her former husband owed her
 on the basis of their marriage contract. She receives from him 1 dinar in
 cash, while the remaining 9 were to be paid in weekly installments of 3
 dirhems as from Dec. 30, 1217. No date is set for the termination of these
 payments.
In addition, she receives "for his children" 5-¼ dirhems per week for the
 duration of one year, as from the Jewish New Year, which began on Sept.
 4, 1217, about two weeks after that settlement.
Clearly, the 1 dinar received had to cover the divorcee's maintenance be-
 tween the date of the settlement and the day when the weekly installments
 were to begin, a period of 19 weeks and one or two days. The amount of 5-¼
 for the children (in the plural, and not in the dual, as would have been said
 in case two children were involved) must mean that there were three children
 and that 1-¾ dirhems were earmarked for each per week. The supposition
 was that 2 dirhems per week were the absolute minimum, the lowest alimony
 known otherwise from this period being half a dirhem per day, but that in
 view of three children living together a "reduction" was granted to the father.
 Similar cases are known from this period. It appears that the mother, in
 acknowledgment of the advance payment of 1 dinar for a period of about
 1wenty weeks, also contented herself for this period with the weekly minimum
 of two dirhems. This would again reflect a rate of exchange of 1 :40.
If this assumption is correct, the payment of 9 dinars in installments of
 3 dirhems per week would require about two years. For people who live on
l-¾-3 dirhems a. week, even a slight fluctuation in the value of the money
 during such a long period would have been of considerable impact. Under
 such circumstances, the absence of the stipulation how many installments
were to be paid is rather remarkable. Normally, in contracts allowing for







 installments, either the number of installments or their termination or both
 is indicated. The settlement was not made in a court, hut by a notary. Still,
 his handwriting is orderly, the legal terms are properly used, and he states
 that all the formalities required by the law had been attended to and even
 notes the name of the witness who testified together with him, a matter of
 precaution omitted by many notaries in the entries in their books.
65. BM, MS Or 10 126. Bilbays, September, 1239.
A merchant had contracted a commenda, qirii.cJ, with a Maghrebi (not
 identical with the one referred to in sec. 63) before both a Muslim and a
 Jewish court. This had been converted into a loan for which a fixed interest
 of 20 dirhems per month was stipulated. Both the Arabic term riba' and the
 Hebrew ribbith are used, as well as fa'z'da muta'ayyin(a), "fixed profit."
 When the debtor finally proved to be unable to pay, he was forced to sell
 his house to the creditor for 36 dinars, but was granted the right to buy it
 back in the course of twelve years. The court session of Sept., 1239, dealt
 with a side issue: t'he statement that there remained no claim against the
 Maghrebi except for some of the interest that he had not yet paid.13
The 36 dinars must have represented the whole debt and perhaps even
 part of the interest due, for otherwise there would have been no need for
 the settlement of September, 1239. Assuming that the debt was 36 dinars
 and the exchange rate again I :40, the yearly interest stipulated would have
 been 6 dinars per year or 16-¾ percent. Since among the thousands of Geniza
 documents not a single other one has been found in which a fixed interest
 is stipulated to a Jew, the feasibility of this assumption cannot be checked
 by comparison with other Geniza material.
For the first half of the thirteenth century, dated documents for practically
 every year have been preserved in the Geniza and for most years several
 documents. Only in exceptional cases, however, is reference made to the
rate of exchange between gold and silver coins (cf. secs. 60 and 61). Most of
 the transactions of smaller or middle size were made in dirhems. The sums
 are normally indicated with the phrase: min al-waraq al-jayyid al-mi~ri al-
 muta'amal bih waraq jayyidan (thus in sec. 66) or al-dariihim al-muta'iimal
biha bil-diyar al-miijriyya allati hi naqd mif/r, "the dirhem.;; that are in use
 in the land of Egypt, which is the Egyptian currency," or similar phrases.
 These expressions are old, but appear regularly and extensively only in this
 period and one wonders whether they do not emphasize that the official
character of the means of payment, but not its content of silver, guarantees
 its value. We note at random five cases, indicating the sums involved and
the topic of the document referred to.

A loan of 215 dirhems, to be paid back in one lump after the lapse of

cause that particular year was a Jewish leap year, which has thirteen months).
 It is even more noteworthy that the so-called "cut-up" dirhcms, fractions
of dirhams cut up in irregular shapes, are invariably mentioned in contracts
without their equivalent in gold. They are always introduced with the formula
al-dariihim al-mutaqatti'a al-muta'iimal bihii bil-diyiir al-mi~riyya, "the cut
up dirhcms which arc legal tender in Egypt." This fact confirms the correct-
ness of Paul Balog's assumption that these dirhems decoupes were official
emissions (cf. Paul Balog, "ttudes numismatiques de l'tgypte musulmane,"
Bulletin de l'Institut d'P.gypte 33 [1952], especially pp. 28 and 33).
 In another study, "Notes on some Fatimid Round-flan Dirhems," Numis-
matic Chronicle, XVII th ser. I (1961), 176, Balog has shown that "cut-up"
dirhems represented the normal silver currency in Egypt even in late Fati-
mid times-a fact not reflected in Geniza documents.
 The examples noted thus far are all from the time of Sultan al-Kiimil

 A woman sells one-quarter of a house for 300 Kamili dirhems, min al,-
 dar<ihim al-nuqra al-k<imiliyya. Another fragment, put under the same glass
 as being a part of the same document, and which speaks also about a sale
 of a quarter of a house, but for dinars, not for dirhems, has nothing to do
 with our document. Scrutiny of the second fragment proves it was united
 with the one discussed here erroneously.
 77. Mosseri A 18. January, 1268.
 A divorcee agrees to accept 30 instead of 70 Kamili dirhems due her,
 whereas her former husband forgoes claims that he had against her.

It seems practicable to add here a few other dated documents from Mamluk
 times concerning the exchange rate of gold and silver. For after 1265 the
 Geniza material becomes comparatively sparse and for the fourteenth cen-
 tury a special study based on it is hardly possible.

Sale of an Abyssinian slave girl with a white apot on her left eye for 266-½
 nuqra ( dirhems).
The strange price finds its explanation in the usage of the Geniza courts
 attested between 1280 and 1379 (see the following sections) to evaluate
 =
 1 dinar as 13-½ dirhems. 266-½: 13-½ 20 dinars, the usual price for a slave
 girl (see p. 139, above).
79. TS NS J 297. Fustat, November 14, 1289.1:20.
The second installment due a wife according to her marriage contract was
 fixed at 20 dinars, beir.g 400 dirhem nuqra.
This is in accordance with the data in literary sources for this period, see
 Balog, "History of the Dirhem," pp. 133 ff.
On the other hand, the very fact that it was necessary to fix the rate of
 exchange of the dinar seems to indicate that fluctuations were common in
 those days (see Balog, op. cit.).

mentioned in the letter I prefer the latter date. But, thus far, I am unable
to provide a definite proof for my preference.

 In this account for Ibn 'Awkal, written around 1030, 31-¼ dinars, 10-½
qirats and 12-% dirhems a:-e added up to a total of 32 dinars. Since a dinar
has 24 qirats, this equation results: 24 - (3 + 10-½) qirats 10-½ qirats=
= 12-% dirhems. Thus, arithmetically, I dinar contains 28-% dirhems.







 Before trying to draw conclusions from the sources presented above, a
 word must be said about the terms current in them. The most important
 fact emanating from an undoubtable mass of evidence is the use of the word
 dirham in the general sense of a low-value silver coin. Full silver coins are
 called either ( dirham) nuqra ( cf. secs. 28 and 49; also secs. 76, 78, 79 and 81),
or fu/4,a, "silver" (cf. secs. 5 and 30, and also sec. 6, or fi<J<Ja nuqra, see below).
In a letter by Nahray b. Nissim the word has the same meaning: 17 fuj.cja
are worth one dinar (cf. the almost identical rate in sec. 5).15
 The following passage from the letter TS 12.288, which was written around
 1070, is a telling example of the use of the term dariihim in the specific sense
of low-value silver coins. L. 11: wajadna fihii mi'atayn wa-sittin dirham ficjcja
nuqra wa-khamsa wa-arba'in dirham wa-n~/ dariihim. "We found in it [in
the ~urra, purse] 260 dirhem of nuqra silver and 45-½ 'dariihim dirhems."
 The term "waraq" for low-value silver coins, so frequent in the Ayyubid
period (cf. above pp. 384 ff.), rarely appears in Fatimid documents (cf. sec.
16 B or the following passage from a letter written about 1100: "I had sent
you 1 dinar and 50 dirham waraq. I am sending you now 4 new dinars and
20 dirham waraq." 16 ) Likewise, the term "black dirhem" is repeatedly found
only in Ayyubid times, for example, in a court record of 1214, in which a
debt of 76-¼ dirhems min al,-waraq al,-muta'amal, bih ft 'l-diyiir al-m4riyya
darahim sawiid is acknowledged, to be paid back in weekly installments of
10 dirhems,17 or when a schoolmaster grants in 1224 a loan of 200 kesafim
shelpirim ("black silver pieces," Heb.), to be returned in five monthly in-
stallments of 40 dirhems.18 From Fatimid times, thus far only one example
has been noted, approximately from the year 1060, when a scribe from Old
Cairo informed his colleague and partner that he had received as a· fee "two
black dirhems (dirhamayn sud) which I sold for 1 dirhem." 19 Most likely,
"black dirhems" designate here a coin, about a hundred pieces of which were
worth I dinar, while the regular low-value dirhem had a rate of exchange of
about fifty (cf. above, secs. 9 and 48 with secs. 38-44).
 The reason for the rarity of the terms "waraq" and "dirbam aswad" in
documents from the Fatimid period is to be sought in the use of dirhem in
the general sense of a low-value silver coin. As such it designated both the
regular dirhems whose fineness was about one-third of the nuqra and the local
emissions which must have consisted almost exclusively of copper or other
base metals. It is strange, at first sight, that in one and the same letter the
term was used indiscriminately for both types (cf. secs. 15 and 27, as well
as sec. 26, where no definition of the dirhem concerned is provided). The
reason for this lack of precision obviously was the fact that the difference
in the value of these two types of coins was so evident that there could be
no doubt as to which of them was intended. In sec. 15, D, local emissions
are called waraq ghayr muthmina, cheap silver money.
 The relationship between the full- and low-value silver coins was by no
means stable. Sec. 24 contains a remark to the effect that around the middle
of the eleventh century, the 'iyiir in the Tunisian town of Sfax "again was
3," that is, that again 3 low-value dirhems were accepted for one full silver
coin. We hear about a similar fluctuation in Egypt approximately at the
same time: "They gave me 7 dinars in silver at a rate of 3-½, while the rate
was 4." 20 The reference is, of course, to the rate of exchange not of silver
and gold, but low- and full-value silver.
 Silver ingot is called l)ajar fir/4,a, "silver stone,'' or /.iajar nuqra, the latter







 occurring in a court record written in Fustat around 1100, when 13 }Jajar
 nuqra weighing 2,900 dirhems were sent in four packages ({lababir) from that
 city to the West.21 The former is frequently to be found in Nahray's cor-
 respondence. Silver ingot was traded together with silver ornaments.2 z

 The following table summarizes the rates of exchange discussed above. In
 the cases where the rate is given explicitly-they form by far the majority-
 the numbers of the sections concerned are printed in roman type. Where the
 rate has been found by calculation, the relevant section numbers are italicized.
 An asterisk after a number indicates that the document referred to contains
 an opinion about the rate of exchange mentioned. A question mark after a
 number means there were doubts concerning the interpretation of a document.

 CONCLUSIONS
(a) If we exclude the rates of 13-½ and 20 silver pieces per dinar, which,
 in our documents, are confined to the Mamluk period and are discussed later,
 there are only three cases of around 12, four of 17, three of 20--22, and four
 of around 25. In the vast majority of instances, 30 or more silver coins had
 to be paid for 1 dinar; in other words, the dirhem in common use was not
 the nuqra, but the low-value coin. The pure silver coins appear as means of
 payment for merchants engaged in the overseas trade ( cf. in particular sec.
 49, where nuqra to the respectable amount of 140 gold dinars were bought in
 Alexandria for two India merchants at a time of extreme scarcity of silver).
 It must be emphasized, however, that even in accounts of great merchants,
amounting to tens of thousands of dirhems and over a thousand dinars, the
 dirhem referred to is the low-value coin, not the nuqra (cf. sec. 10).
(b) The rate of exchange of 1:35, attested in literature for A.H. 441 (1049-
 1050) (cf. Balog, "History of the Dirhem," p. 122), is reflected also in the
 Geniza documents at certain periods of both the eleventh and the twelfth
 centuries. The table printed above contains eighteen instances of a rate be-
 tween 32 and 37-½ dirhems per dinar.
(c) It seems, however, that the merchants and the judges, the two arbiters
 on market values, were inclined to fix I :40 as the normal rate of exchange.
While the rates between 33-½ and 37-½ are represented as official only by
 one or two examples each, 40 appears in nine instances as [Sar/, to which four
others between 40-½ and 44 are to be added. This official [Sar/ is attested by
documents dated from 1056 through 1232.
 The rate of exchange I :40 is based on the assumptions that 1 gold dinar
is worth 13-1/a pieces of full silver (cf. here secs. 79, 80, 81-84, 91), and
that I full silver piece has the value of 3 dirhems with low silver content
 (cf. above p. 388). These rates are attested in a treatise on "The Secrets of
the Egyptian Mint" by Ma~ur b. Ba'ra, who wrote during the reign of al-
Kamil (1218-1238) (cf. A. S. Ehrenkreutz, "The Standard of Fineness of Gold
Circulating in Egypt at the Time of the Crusades," JAOS, 74 (1954), 163
and n. 10. The Geniza material presented here shows that these standards
were applied in practice, albeit intermittently, for over two hundred years.
 ( d) A specific problem is presented by the Maghrebi dirhems struck under
the Zirids in the eleventh century. Often they had in Egypt a lower value
than the Egyptian coins and sometimes they were not accepted there as
currency at all. In addition, local emissions having a rate of exchange of
about I :200 were common and exposed to serious fluctuations. In one case,
we read about a devaluation from 200 to 1,600 dirhems per dinar. Such a
crash seems to be feasible only in the case of a coin that had next to no
metallic worth and under unspecified circumstances was suddenly taken out
of circulation. It is, however, remarkable, that in one case even the trade
with Europeans was made in this currency (cf. sec. 27).
(e) Another special case and actually lying outside the scope of this work
is the coinage of the Mamluk sultans. The Geniza documents from the late
Ayyubid and the Mamluk periods well illustrate two basic statements made
by Paul Balog in his new book about the subject: "The earlier gold-silver
bi-metallic system yielded its place to a newer system in which silver became







 the standard coin." 23 And, specifically under the Mamluks: "The dirhem
 now became money of account only." 24 When throughout a full century the
 Jewish courts fixed the value of the dinar at 13-½ nuqra ( cf. secs. 78, 80---84,
 91), we are aware of the fact that they had in mind not a coin, but the metal-
 lic value of the silver. As shown in JESHO, 8 (1965), 45--46, the Muslim
 courts adhered to the same practice.
 (/) To return to Fatimid times: The frequent inquiries and statements
about the market rate of the dirhem, as well as the actual reports about
 their "sales" prove that the value of silver was constantly exposed to fluctua-
 tions. On the other hand, as between A.D. 986 and 1232, an average ratio of
l :40 is to be observed in our documents (24 cases of 30--39 and 26 of 40
 and above) .
 (g) A study of the alimony granted by the courts to orphans and divorcees
in different times, as well as that of the emoluments of lower public serv-
ants, seems to result in the assumption of a more or less steady value of
the silver. Two cases quoted above (secs. 62 and 64) dated 1110 and 1217
 respectively, indicate that the authorities concerned must have assumed the
existence of a generally accepted rate of exchange between dinars and dir-
 hems in those periods.
 (h) In view of this long-range relative steadiness of the silver dirhem
one wonders whether the lower strata of the society-as opposed to the mer-
chants class-were much affected by the fluctuations of its market price.
Remarks to the opposite effect, as in secs. 36, 38 and 41, were either con-
nned to times when the dirhem was particularly unstable, or concerned
 merchants rather than people of the lower classes.
 We might imagine that large sections of the population had dealings only
 in regular silver dirhems and had not much need for, or occasion of, changing
 them into gold. This is indeed a point made with great vigor by Carlo M.
 Cipolla with regard to medieval Italy,25 and I was inclined to believe
 that this was the case also in the countries of the Fatimid empire. The pic-
 ture of a society in which one class is more or less confined to the use of low-
value silver money, while another is privileged to handle gold, is indeed very
impressive. It seems, however, that this assumption is not borne out by the
evidence of the Geniza documents, at least for the eleventh and the first
half of the twelfth centuries. The marriage contracts even of the poorest
 people are in dinars, wretched, low-priced houses are sold in dinars, and even
small loans are granted in gold pieces. In some cases, as in our sec. 2 above,
the dinar served perhaps only as a money of account and that payment
actually was made in silver. In most cases, however, it is expressly stated
 that the bridal gift, albeit small, WM handed over in "complete and full-weight
~old pieces"; :e even of 10 dinars, paid for one-eighth of a small house in
 (New) Cairo, it would be said that they were dananir dhahaban 'aynan
mathiiqila,21 and a loan of only 5 dinars, defined as "pure, full-weight, excel-
lent and true Egyptian gold" would be taken out at a time when others re-
ceived loans in low-value silver.28 Thus it seems that gold fulfilled an impor-
tant role in the daily life of the population at large, and consequently the
fluctuations of the value of the dirhem must have concerned the lower mid-
dle class as much as the affluent. In this connection, attention should be
drawn to TS 16.356, a contract of lease of half a house from April, 1120,
where a monthly rent of 7 gold qiriits is stipulated "irrespective of the fJarf,
or rate of exchange."







 All in all, the material presented here seems to prove that sudden and
 severe changes in the rate of exchange were felt as a calamity, while local
 and seasonal fluctuations were observed with composure, just as today people
 would watch the stock market during an uneventful period.

3 Gottheil-Worrell, p. xiii. When Elkan N. Adler visited the place in 1888

(see n. 11), he was told that the building would be repaired soon. In 1890,
large quantities of Geniza material had already made their appearance in the
bazaars and were acquired, for example, for the Bodleian Library, Oxford
 (A. Neubauer and A. E. Cowley, Catalogue of the Hebrew Manuscripts in
the Bodleian Library [Oxford, 1906], II, xii-xvi). These facts fix the date
for the great repairs that led to the complete dispersal of the contents of
the Geniza. As early as summer, 1864, when Jacob Saphir (see next note)
first described the Geniza chamber, he mentioned that repairs had been
made in the synagogue building and that the roof of the Geniza had partly
fallen in. At the time of his visit, the contents of the chamber were buried
under the earth and stones removed from the synagogue during the build-
ing operations. This explains why Saphir himself, although a great connois-
seur of books, was unable to find anything of value.

together from fragments in the three libraries mentioned is the letter, in
 which, in 1161, the Exilarch Daniel b. Hisday of Baghdad confinned Nethanel,
 the head of the Jewish Academy in Cairo, in bis office. The identification of
 the three fragments was achieved by S. Assaf (see the discussion of the docu-
 ment in Mann, Texts, I, 230-235).

25 The two Jewish communities of Cairo, the Rabbanites and the Karaites,

 possess archives that contain some very ancient documents (cf. Richard Got-

 [Karaite, dated 1024); idem in JQR, 19 [1906-1907), 467-539 [Rabbanite,

27 The great Karaite formulary preserved in the British Museum (MS Or

 2538, fs. 86-91, ed. Mann, Texts, II, 189-193) is a modern copy of a fifteenth-
 century manuscript, and was found by a local Karaite in the Geniza in 1864,
 seventeen days after Jacob Saphir had visited it (cf. Mann, Texts, II, 192,
 11. 157-163). Mann thought that the copyist referred to a Karaite Geniza.
 He says, however, expressly, "I found this ancient quire in THE Geniza (al-
 geniza) ," which leaves no doubt as to the provenance of the manuscript.

 29 Grohmann, World of Arabic Papyri, p. 2: "About 16,000 Arabic papyri;

 of paper, somewhat more than 33,000 pieces." Herr Fackelmann, the "Re-
 staurator" of the exemplarily well-kept Papyrus-sammlung Erzherzog Rainer,
 Vienna, told me on July 14, 1965, that it contained 50,000 Arabic fragments
 on paper, 40,000 on papyrus, and 500 on parchment. The corresponding
 numbers in Grohmann, Einfilhrung, are 28,094, 8,000, and 340, respectively.
80 L. Fuks, The Oldest Known Literary Documents of Yiddish Literature
(Leiden, 1957). The title and thesis of this book have given rise to considerable
 discussion on whether the language of the poems is "Hebrew-German" (Ger-
 man written in Hebrew characters) or "Judeo-German" that is, a kind of
 Old Yiddish (a German vernacular spoken solely by Jews). While the Ger-
 manists seem to choose the former alternative, the students of Yiddish prefer
 the latter (Max Weinreich, "Old Yiddish Poetry in Linguistic-Literary Re-
 search," Word, 16 [1960], 100-118).
31 The standard edition of Moses Maimonides' Responsa by A. Freimann
(Jerusalem, 1934) is based on ancient Hebrew translations. The Arabic origi-
nals together with a new Hebrew translation were published, in three volumes,
 by J. Blau (Jerusalem, 1957, 1960, 1961). Cf. S. D. Goitein, "Maimonides as
 Chief Justice," JQR, 49 (1959), 191-204. The Responsa of Abraham Mai-
monides were published by A. Freimann (Jerusalem, 1937) in collaboration
with me; I established the texts of the Arabic originals and translated them
into Hebrew.
 Quite a number of autograph responsa of the two masters have been pub-
 lished and there are others that await publication. Thus, MS Bodi. Heb. d 66
(Cat. 2878), f. 84, is the original of a question addressed to Abraham Mai-







 monides and his autograph answer, which wl're rendered with omissions in
 the manuscript that formed the basis of the 1937 edition (ibid., pp. 104-105).
As is evident from the material preserved, the procedure adhered to for
 the submission of queries to religious authorities was as follows: On the
 paper that contained the question, sufficient space was left blank for the
 answer. The scholar wrote his opinion with his own hand, while a scribe
 made a dean copy for dispatch to the person who had asked the question.
 This explains why some of the originals of both the questions and the an-
 swers have been preserved from the archives of the two Maimonideses, who
 lived in Old Cairo. For further details, see S. D. Goitein, "New Autograph
 Responsa of Maimonides," Tarbiz, 28 (1959), esp. pp. 193-194.
32 Obadiah's autobiography is contained in several manuscripts, translated

 in Med. People, no. 4.
33 Aramaic remained compulsory only in bills of divorce and deeds of manu-

 mission and was also used, albeit not exclusively, in the general sections of
 a marriage contract. Only the "Zionist" sect of the Karaites replaced Aramaic
 by Hebrew in all court documents and did not adopt Arabic, at least of-
 ficially.

35 Medieval Hebrew script was able to express short u and i, as well as to

 indicate the Imala, or the pronunciation of a similar to e. There exist long,

 would reveal much about the pronunciation of Arabic at the time of their
 writing.

 CHAPTER I: The Mediterranean Scene During the High Middle
 Ages (969-1$60)

 1. HISTORICAL SURVEY
1 See above, p. 19.
2 People originating from the following towns and districts in Iran and
 Central Asia have been noted thus far in the Geniza records, mostly of the
 first half of the eleventh century: A.mul, Ahwiz, Arrajin, Barzanj, Dimghan,
 Hamadhiin, Hormshir, Hulwan, Kizerun, Khorasan, Kinnan, Ma.ragba,
 Niha.wand, Nishipiir (N'JSibiir), Qiimis, Samarqand, Shiniz, Siniin, Sirif,
 Sirjin, Tawwaz, Tus, Tustar, Urmiya.
These names have been noted at random. No special research has been
 made for the purpose. See also the family name al-'Ajami, "the Persian."
 However, Farisi (written with or without alef) usually designates textiles
 coming from Firs, the southwestern district of Persia. In one document,
 TS 28.17, I. 43, it must be the equivalent of "business agent," as it is men-
 tioned between ~ayarifi, banker, and wakil, representative of merchants. Of
 Iranian personal names, borne mostly by persons living in the tenth century
 and partly serving also as family names, the following ma.y be mentioned:
 Bibiid, Babshid and Bafshid, Bakhtaway, Khodidiid, Khoshnam, Kujik,
 Rozbih, Shahin, Shahryar, Yazdad.

 15 The Arabic term ~aqlabi (spelled in different ways) practically
 desig-
 nates any European outside the Byzantine and Frankish empires. About

ing to 1140. Shaked, Bibliography, p. 115, is to be changed accordingly. The
man is called "Joseph ha-Kohen, the Sicilian, son of our master Moses,"
which shows that he hailed from Sicily. Had al-Siqilli been his family name,
it would have come after the name of his father. The document is in the
best handwriting of the judge Nathan b. Samuel. This Joseph might have
been the father of Abraham b. Joseph al-Siqilli (TS 32.10, I. 27).

the left side of this lengthy court record has been preserved, but the main
points are clear. In Denia, Spain, Ephraim b. Jacob appoints one Abfm as
his attorney to claim whatever his late father might have left him in Egypt.
In a postscript, Abftn is specifically empowered to sue a man called Abu
 Na~r Musafir. The third entry is made in al-Mahdiyya, as is proved by
the signature of the judge Moses b. Labrat, well-known from lett{!rs written
by him, as well as from documents, some dated 1098. Ral]amim b. Amram
 (his father's name is spelled also in the Arabic way, 'lmran), the second
signatory, appears again in the fourth entry, which contains expressly the
 (Hebrew) name of Alexandria used at that time, No Amon, and is signed
by qwb dr'y, which is the other half of the name "Abraham b. Jacob Der'i,"
then judge in the Mediterranean port. Of the final signature only "sf, Head
of the court of the Academy" is preserved. The name is to be read as
"Solomon, son of Joseph, late Head of the court of the Academy," a religious
dignatary active in Fustat ( ~r. Mann, I, 187 n. 2). The remnants of the
signature here differ from the signature of this judge in TS 13 J 2, f. 4
 (Fustat, 1094), but since both are in monumental style, they can hardly
be compared. On the other hand, it seems that the handwriting here is
similar to that in Solomon b. Joseph's lengthy historical poem celebrating
the Fatimid victory over the Seljuk invaders of Egypt in 1077 (see Julius
H. Greenstone, The Turkoman Defeat at Cairo by Solomon ben Joseph ha-
Kohen, reprinted from the American Journal of Semitic Languages and
 Literatures, 22 [Jan., 1906], 6-7, facsimile). (Mann was wrong in assuming
that this Solomon had a scholarly brother called Judah. The Judah to whom
 Mann refers was a Babylonian, not a Palestinian, and that Judah never
 refers to his father as Head of the court of the Academy [cf. Mann, II, 101].
Thus, it cannot be assumed that the signature is to be read as "Judah b.
,Toseph.")
46 TS 10 J 10, f. 3, ed. E. Ashtor in Sefarad, 24 (1964), 63-68. As may







 sometimes occur even to the most competent scholar, some mishaps in the
 reading and translation of the letter caused that its import was lost on the
 editor. The writer of the letter was called Ephraim b. Jacob, and, although
 these biblical names were very much in use in those times, it may well be
 that he is identical with the merchant from Denia mentioned in the document
 discussed in the preceding note. He may either have continued the overseas
 business of his father or have traveled to Egypt because bis attorney was
 not too successful in claiming his father's estate. No other Ephraim b. Jacob
 has been found by me in the Geniza.
47 TS 13 J 23, f. 22, 11. 18-20, margin, 1. 2, Nahray 223. In this letter the
 writer assumes that his father is alive. In TS 13 J 28, f. 11, l. 14, Nahray 159,
 he speaks of his mother as a mourning widow. Thus, he must have received
 a letter or another report from home.

 9 A good example is TS Box K 15, f. 68v, which enumerates thirteen

generations of a family and eulogizes the sixth and the ninth through thirteenth
 generations (the last having died recently) for their generosity. Cf. also Mann,
 Texts, I, 469, where the great-grandfather (a nagid) and the grandfather of
the living members of the family are praised in such a way.
10 Strauss, Mamluks, I, 178 n. 20, has rightly emphasized that Qariri (from

 which the family name of the famous Arab poet al-}lariri is derived) originally
 designated a worker, and not a merchant, in silk; cf. also Serjeant, Islamic
 Textiles, XIII-XIV, 104. This is corroborated by the evidence of the Geniza,

 as goldsmithery and embroidery, the Jews were prominent, and in others, like
 shoemaking and leatherwork in general, the Muslims. But each of the two
 religious communities had a share also in the fields in which the other was
 more renowned (cf. Bentov, op. cit., p. 423).

when one craftsman was able to participate in various partnerships.
32 The Lebdi factory was sold later on. Three out of twenty-four shares, i.e.,

one eighth, cost 136-½ dinars. Thus the total value at the time of the sale was
 1,092 dinars. It is natural that the price at selling was somewhat lower than
when a partnership of the management of the place was concluded. The docu-
ment referring to the transaction is a draft, which contains also a description

 Ancient Rome (Penguin Books, 1956), p. 306, n. 20. The Roman corporations

 a certain group of Jews knew how to find it, cf. Serjeant, Islamic Textiles,
 XV-XVI, 35, 70.
10 This has been shown in the Ph.D. dissertation of Dr. Hayyim J. Cohen

 on the occupations of Muslim religious scholars down to the period of the
 Crusaders (Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1963, in Heb.; not yet published).
 He notes 55 Muslim gold- and silversmiths and workers in the mint, 22 manu-
 facturers of glass, and 443 pharmacists and perfumers. See also Brockelmann,

11 Abu Sa'd Tustari (d. 104i) was vizier to the mother of the caliph, but

 had the power of a plenipotentiary minister. His son became vizier to the

 as viziers under the Fatimids.

19 Cf. Heyd, Commerce du Levant I, 178, esp. nn. 6 and 7, 171 (n. 2). The

 European word damask has nothing to do with pre-Islamic Arabic dimaqs,
 which is derived from Greek metaxa (as believed by some scholars), for
 this word was not used by the Arabs at the time of their contacts with
 merchants from western Europe. Silk from Palestine and Syria: e.g., TS 13
 J 19, f. 27, 1. s• (once, when no silk fabrics arrived in Old Cairo from the
 West, some supply from Syria kept the price down); TS Box K 15, f. 99,

 21 Lopez-Raymond, Medieval Trade, p. 22. The "Book of the Prefect" was
 promulgated in 911 or 912. As we see here, at least some of its regulations
 must have been observed in the subsequent centuries as well. One document,
 dated 1157, speaks about Rumi silk in al-Mal}alla: TS 8 J 5, f. 18. As it is
 mentioned together with lasin, however, I take it as referring to silk coming
 from Christian Sicily. In a letter from Jerusalem sent to Fustat around
 1060, colored Constantinople silk, ~arir q~tantini ma§bugh, is ordered to-
 gether with Spanish crimson, qirmiz shiidhuni. Probably these commodities
 too, came to Egypt via Sicily; TS 13 J 6, f. 22v, I. 16. About silk froU:

 fabric of heavy damask (cf. Heyd, Commerce du Levant, II, 700). Lead-
 colored ( r~~i) : a color popular in the Geniza. According to Heyd, the
 siglaton used to be of one color, namely dark blue. In all the inventories of
 synagogue property, where the siglaton was used not for clothing but for
 covering walls and columns, it had two colors (light-green and blue-black,
 white and red, white and black, and so on), S. D. Goitein, "The Synagogue
 Building and its Furnishings ... ," Eretz-lsrael, 7 (1964), Eng. summary,

 Arabe-Frani;aise (Paris, 1935), p. 47, in Syria today b~ali designates the
 color of the onion skin; according to the context, however, the reference
 here is more likely to the violet gray of an onion cut open.

(979 A.D.), ed. S. Assaf, Yerushalayim (1953), p. 110, where the same persons
as in TS 12.462 are mentioned. In Ma'iilim al-Qurba, Arabic text, p. 236, and
TS Box K 6, f. 44v, I. 27 (1247) the wooden locks are called tjibiib. The
craftsman manufacturing them is called <J,abbiib in TS 18 J 1, f. 3 (1006).

Spanish Jews in Fogaras, Transylvania (today Romania) in 1697, quoted by
J. Komlos, Kirjath Sepher, 35 (1960), 465.
61 Indirectly, this aspect is evident in a query sent around 1134 from Aden

to a religious authority in Old Cairo, where it was asked whether translucent
Chinese porcelain could be regarded as glass for ritual purposes (cf. TS 8
J 37, f. 1, India Book 33).

Dozy, Supplement, I, 387b, has the plural makhiifi.
 77 TS 20.128v. In certain parts of Yemen today, maddiir is simply a potter.

It is noteworthy that Spiro, Dictionary of Modem Arabic, and Qasimi,
Metiers Damascains (seep. 415, above, n. 1) do not note this word at all.
78 A maker of leather bottles, batta, e.g., for flour, TS 13 J 25, f. 2, is

invariably called battiit, TS 24.76; TS Box K 15, i. 66, col. Ia; TS Box K 15,

 TS 8 J 6, f. 18; all, it seems, referring to different members of one family. The
 same family name appears in the thirteenth century: ULC Or 1080 J 113, I. 4.
 Since the Ma'alim al-Qurba, Arabic text, p. 237 11. 13-16, emphasizes that the
 dahhanitn (painters in oil) should be prohibited from painting figures, it is
 likely that this practice was then still alive.
88 TS 8 J 5, f. 12, where the muhandizin are dealing with a dispute about

 a house. Westminster College, Arab. II, f. 79: a scholar called son of the
 muhandiz. TS Box J 1, f. 47, col. III: muhandis (with s), April, 1234,
 mentioned in a communal account.
89 Carpenters and sawyers employed in buildings: TS Box K 5, f. 76; TS

 in a carpenter's shop: TS 8 J 7, f. 18*.
90 Turners (kharrafin): TS Box K 15, f. 58, I. 13 (as contributors); TS 13

 J 9, f. 5 (the son of the turner signing a document in 1047). The Gate of the
 Turners: TS 12.525 and 16.72, cf. Worman, JQR, 18 (1905), 26. The Street of
 the Chest-Makers (isanadiqin): TS 13 J 3, f. 9.
 91 Worman, JQR, 18 (1905), 30-32. In addition to the mills situated inside

 the city mentioned there ( one adjoining the house of the Head of the
 Congregations, cf. ibid., p. 32), there was one in the immediate vicinity of the
 house of the Nagid: TS 13 J 25, f. 19. A miller sis a contributor to a public
 appeal: TS Box K 15, f. 18, I. 14.
92 TS 8 J 4, f. 1& (Alexandria, 1102); TS 8 J 10, f. 17 (Old Cairo, 1133).
93 Seller of flour (daqqaq): TS 13 J 25, f. 2. The writer left with him a

 pawn to get a leather bottle full of flour. Fine flour was called naqi, literally
 pure: TS 12.793, I. 22 ff., Nahray 148. Two persons called daqqiiq appear in a
 list of taxpayers: TS Box K 15, f. 96, col. II; another in TS 24.76 (receivers
 of loaves). A female daqqaqa: TS 24.76, I. 33.
~ This is evident from many lists of distribution of loaves to the needy
 and to community officials, e.g., TS Box K 15, fs. 5, 15, 39, and 50. One
 distinguished between khabbaz, baker {extremely common), and farran,
 literally "oyen-rnan," most probably a person who did the baking but not the
 preparation of the dough: TS Arabic Box 51, f. 107; TS NS J 293; Gottheil-
 W orrell, XVI, p. 82.
95 TS Box K 15, f. 43 (contributor); TS Box K 15, f. 54, col. III, I. 14
(paying rent}: TS 13 J 24, f. 14, 1. 14 (traveling from Alexandria to Cairo);
 verso, I. 5 ( greetings to the elder Zikri al-Ka'ki).
96 John Rylands Library, Manchester, Gaster Collection A 1192. "Ringlets'':

 l;iulayqiit. not yet traced in a dictionary, but known as a place-name in
 Palestine.
111 Khamiri: TS Box 15, f. 2, col. II, l. 3. This word, too, seems not to be
 listed in the dictionaries. Khmiri, howeYer, is a family name in Egypt up to
 the present day. Cf. also Dozy, Supplement, I, 404b, for khiimirji in the same
 sense. In Persian kha.mira is either dough or a conserve flavored with the
 aroma of roses or violets.
18 Ibn al-~ajj (d. 1336), al,-Madkhal, I, 239, quoted by Strauss, MamlukB,







I, 183. Sahl b. M~liaq, Epistle to Jacob b. Samuel, trans. L. Nemoy, Karaite
Anthology (New Haven, 1952), p. 110.
 99 Harriis was pronounced hurriis: BM Or 5566 D 24, I. 11, India Book 89,

where some Cairene Jewish merchants who made trouble in Aden are described
as having lost face because of eating in the houses of Samaritans, Karaites, and
hurriisin; TS 18 J 1, f. 6, I. 16 (the son of a harriis doing work similar to his
father's in 1028); TS Box K 15, f. 14, col. II, I. 2 (payer of reduced poll tax).
It is interesting that the Spaniard lbn 'Abdun uses this form, cf. JA, 224
(1934), 297, while Ma'iilim al-Qurba, Arabic text, p. 108, has harii'isi. This
haris(a) was different from its ancient Arabic and present Yemenite namesake
 (above, p. 72).
 100 Jashshiish: Bodi. MS Heb. f. 56 (Cat. 2821, no. 16), f. 45v* and 46;

Shawwii: TS 20.76, I. 4 (name of the proprietor of a ship in Tunisia; cf. in
detail Ma'alim al-Qurba, Arabic text, p. 92); 'ashshi: BM Or 5566 C, I. 25+
(his daughter receives alms); tabbiikh: often, e.g., TS Box K 15, f. 14, col. I,
I. 8 (one from Baghdad, pays reduced poll tax); TS Box K 15, f. 50c, col. II,
I. 18 (receives two loaves), Bodi. MS Heb. e 98, f. 68 (fourteenth century;
meaning here perhaps butcher). In Ibn 'Abdim (op. cit., see preceding note),
p. 242, the tabbiikh is a caterer at weddings; in Ma'alim al-Qurba, p. 102, he
prepares cooked meat, as opposed to the "roaster," see above. Boiled, un-
seasoned meat was prepared by the nashili: TS 10 J 13, f. 3. Bawiiridi, literally
"maker of cooling or cold vegetables," cf. Dozy, Supplement, I, 68b, and
Ma'<ilim a/,-Qurba, p. 96: TS 13 J 18, f. 29 (a letter addressed to Mr. B. in
Alexandria). Kamukhi (voweled thus and not kamakhi), very common family
name of at least two clans, one being Kohens, one not, e.g., TS Box K 15, f. 70,
ed. Mann, II, 247 (eleventh century); TS Box K 15, f. 50c, col. II, I. 17 and d,
col. II, I. 14 (twelfth century); TS Box K 15, f. 36v, I. 9 (thirteenth century).
Mutarri: TS 13 J 6, f. 27*; TS Arabic Box 6, f. 28, I. 7. The bayyii', above,
p. 152, also belongs here.
 101 Butcher (jazz<ir): very frequent, e.ir., TS 20.175v, I. 21 ("near the

butcher's shop in Old Cairo") ; TS Box K 15, f. 13, col. I (renting a store be-
longing to the community, 1183-1184); TS Box K 15, f. 34 (a contributor);

f. 2, ed. S. D. Goitein in Sefunot. 8 (1964), 111-113* (a respectable Kohen);
slaughterer of goats (dhabbii~ al-ma'iz): Box K 15, f. 96; meat-rarver

 eral times, according to the quality desired, cf. E/1, s.v. "Sukkar" (J. Ruska).
 The town is called al-Minya. No doubt, Minyat Zifta is meant, which had large
 sugar workshops (TS 24.25, 11. 25, 31).


 5. AGRICULTURE AND FISHERY
1 Ghaza: TS 12.147, 11. 4-5 (March 15, 1051). The scribe Halfon b.

 Manasse: ENA 4020, f. 30*. Maimonides, Responsa, II, 611. •
2 Immigrant from Baghdad: Hillel b. Eli, ENA 4020, f. 30*. Newcomer from

 Palestine: the judge Nathan b. Solomon, letter to him from his cousin (TS
 12.312), who sends him "some of the wheat" and asks for instructions on which
 price the rest should be sold. A number of other instances in Nahray.
3 TS 20.99, II. 32-33 (around 1090).

4 TS 28.6, sec. A (dated 1079). The fields were in Dammiih and were at-

 tended to by a "gardener," khawli, called Khayrfm.
5 TS NS J 27, sec. 2 (dated 1143). The payments due were called murat-

 tabayn, the first consisting of 9 waybas of wheat, the second of 8, instead of
 which 75 dirhems were remitted in cash.
6 Both details in DK 245, ed. Samuel Kandel, Genizai keziratok (Budapest,

 1909), no. I, 11. 23-24 and 30-32. The town concerned probably was Minyat
 Ziftii. Cf. TS 18 J 3, f. 1, where, it seems, the same Nii§ir al-Din is referred to.
 Payment in cash and grain: Claude Cahen, "Le regime des impots dans le
 Fayyiim ayyiibide," Arabica, 3 (1956), 12.
7 TS BoxK 15, f. 6 (July, 1178). The donations ranked from¼ to 3 waybas

 (3-¾ to 45 liters).
8 Gottheil-Worrell, XXVII, p. 118, I. 20 (around 1060) ("wheat given as a

 loan like dinars").
9 Dropsie 395, margin.

 10 "Farm" as designation for village: e.g., TS 18 J 3, f. 1. Vice versa, in

 medieval Hebrew, a farm would be called a village, so that one would speak
 about a kefar of fruit trees (Assaf, Texts, p. 102 n. 2 [quotation from Isaac
 al-Fiisi]). Kalbaeha: TS 10 J 17, f. 23v, I. 3.
 11 TS 13 J 9, f. 4, ed. Assaf, Texts, p. 110. With regard to Hammiiriyya, a

 ,·illage near Damascus, the word qarya is used instead of <J,ay'a (TS 13 J 8,
 f. 25v). ThiS', however, may have been a part of the village's name.
 12 TS 12.243, I. 17, Nahray 139. The letter was written in Minyat Sammanud
 and obviously referred also to Tatay (TS 8 J 19, £. 11, Nahray 138), and
 Damsis (TS NS J 13, Nahray 137).

 the state of crops in the Ghaza district, is incomplete. The barley of the Ghaza
 district used to be exported to England for brewing beer.

 ustul, or warship, of the enemy: Bodl. MS Heb. b 13, f. 49 (Cat. 2834, no. 30),
 I. 39. Both letters are from the middle of the eleventh century.
14 ULC Or 1080 J 17, I. 9, Nahray 85. Thus rice obviously was grown in

 northern Syria (cf. Canard, "Le riz" [above, n. 22], p.125 n. 7).

 oil" (zayt bizr): TS 13 J 15, f. 5, 1. 18 (an urgent order for it, sent from
Damascus to Old Cairo). The inventory of the store mentioned in the pre-
 ceding note (TS 12.525), lists as its main assets linseed oil and olives, but not
olive oil. Linseed oil for lighting appears regularly in accounts of expenditure
 on synagogues (e.g., TS Box K 3, f. 11). Olive oil was also used for this, of
 course (cf. same account and TS 8 J 11, f. 7a, I. 2). For consignments of
 marinatayn zayt l}arr ordered from Aden by different persons at different
 times, see lndia Book 50, II. 31, and 148, 1. 20; marina appears solely in this
 connection.

 7. SLAVES AND SLAVE GIRLS
1 Quoted by Charles Verlinden, L'Esclavage dans l'Europe medievale

 (Brugge, 1955), I, 42. This book contains a chapter about the legal and
 economic position of slaves in Islam (pp. 227-239), which is now largely
 superseded by the extensive article" 'Abd" in E/2 (R. Brunschvig). The best
 account about the real conditions is found in Mez, Renaissance, chap. xi, where,
 however, no sufficient distinction is made between the various social and
 geographical milieus. For slavery in the Jewish community during our period
 see Baron, History of the Jews, IV, 187-196 (niainly in Europe) and, in
 particular, S. Assaf, Be'ohole Ya'aqov (in Heb.) (Jerusalem, 1943), pp. 223-
 256; idem, Texts, pp. 166-170; idem in Zion, 5 (1940), 271-280.

iii, sec. 2, p. 68. William L. Westermann, The Slave Systems of Greek and

the Islamic Mediterranean society of the eleventh through the thirteenth
centuries.

 the first of the Jewish month Tebeth fell in that year on a Monday, it must

Fayruz, the slave

greeted (dated Nov., 1167). Slave girls' greeting: TS 16.179* (styled here
tJabiyya, not, as in the East, jariya). In the same letter from Tunisia, "the
tJabi" kisses the ground before his master and his mistress. The same phrase
is used in any letter addressed by a free man to a judge. A wife writes to her
husband: "'Passion,' Wala', kisses your hand" (ULC Or 1080 J 71, 1. 8).

five queries concerning merchants traveling to India, to which others, re-
ferring to travels to a distant country, should be added. There are more such
queries in the printed edition of the Responsa by his son Abraham. I found
two others in the Geniza (India Book 169, 233).

18 I compiled this list after only a cursory perusal of Nahray's accounts and

 correspondence. There are several thousand references to be consulted, so
 that only a special study devoted to the subject will yield a. complete descrip-
 tion of Nahray's trading activities. Nahray was called "the Maghrebi tiijir"
 (TS Box 25, f. 130, address, Nahray 142, see above, n. 1).

 stood the term rubii'iyya (Sicilian quarter dinars). Thus far we have found
 only one case in which tajir is connected with the name of an article of mer-
 chandise and this in a document from the thirteenth century, when the term
 might have lost its precise meaning: tiijir al-nil, merchant of indigo (Bodi. MS

 assumed the specific meaning of the contract described in our text. The ex-

 5 Fez: Abraham and Tan9um, sons of Jacob (TS 12.829, ed. Mann, Tem,

 I, 123-126 [Feb., 1007]). This firm was entrusted with the transfer of dona-
 tions from Morocco to the Jewish academies in Baghdad (cf. ibid., p. 125,
 11. 15-16). Two Tiiherti brothers of Qayra.wiin write to the three Tustaris in
 Old Cairo (TS 12.133). Three Ta.herti brothers in Qayrawim address Ibn
 'Awkal and bis two elder sons in Old Cairo (ULC Or 1080 J 248"). In a later
 letter, he and his three sons are addressed (BM Or 5542, f. 15•). A generation







 earlier, he and his father formed one firm (TS 12.383). The brothers Berechiah
 of Qayrawan, who were intermarried with the Tii.hertis, sent to Ibn 'Awkal
 letters (TS 12.175, TS 13 J 36, f. 1, ed. S. D. Goitein in Tarbiz, 34 [1965],
 169-182). For TS 13 J 25, f. 18, a letter from a firm in al-Ahwaz, addressed to
 the three Tustaris, cf. above, p. 164. The letter contains a reference to a third
 firm, the sons of Zakariyya'. An early letter to the three Tustaris is found in
 TS 8 J 36, f. 2. For Lebanon, TS 8.38, an eleventh-century letter of two broth-
 ers from Baalbek, exporting cheese to Egypt, serves as an example. See also
 below,n. 9.
The oldest example of a family partnership is contained in Saadya Gaon's
 correspondence from the year 921-922, where three brothers, renowned as
 supporters of the Gaon's Yeshiva, Abu 'I-Faraj Sulaymii.n, Abu Isl;tiiq Ibrahim,
 and Abu Sahl 'Ezer, have as their common address the store of their father
 'Ali b. Sulayman (Dropsie 332). A late instance is revealed in a court record
 from .June, 1129, where Nissim b. Benayii. and his son undertake under joint

la lumiere des documents de la
 Geniza du Caire," Levi-ProvenQal M emoriaJ, Volume (Paris, 1962), pp. 566-
 568, where, however, Barhiin's daughter is referred to erroneously as the wife
 of Nahray b. Nissim. She was the wife of his father. The article speaks about
 five instead of four brothers because at the time of its writing the identities
 of Mfrnii and Abu '1-Khayr were not yet established. 'U~ba wiil.iida wakalima-

 7 In Bodi. MS Heb. d 65 (Cat. 2877), f. 9, II. 15, 24, and 34, ed. Assaf, Texts,

 pp. 179-180, the brothers Isma'il and Abu 'l-Khayr (Mi1sa) are in Egypt,
 while Abu 'l-Faql ~ali1J. is in Spain. In several other letters, these two brothers
 are referred to as being in Egypt, while their wives and children are still in
 Tunisia. In ULC Or 1080 J 248, ~alil) is in Qayrawan, but in ibid. J 35 he is
 in Egypt together wHh Isma'il. In DK 13, l. 17, Abu Suriir Isaac is on his
 way to Egypt. Thus, each of the four brothers was at one time in that country.
 The account of 1024: ULC Or 1080 J 291.
 8 E.g., TS 20.21 (April, 1076): release of a man who had owed 145-% dinars

 to a partnership, perhaps permanent, between a father and a son. TS 16.256
(about twenty or twenty-five years later: complaint against a representative
 of the merchants who did not settle the accounts of a partnership between two
 brothers, one of whom had died). TS 12.651 (Jan.-Feb., 1130): settlement
 after the death of a brother, who was also a partner, with the latter's daughter
 and wife.
 9 E.g., DK 13, I. 13•: partnership of the writer with his brother and Ibn

 'Awkal. TS 20.76, ll. 16-17: several partnerships with a brother in different
 specified commodities. We also find two Taherti brothers of the third genera-
 tion signing as a firm (TS 16.339•).
10 E.g., DK XV, ll. 13, 23v, I. 6: three brothers, cousins of Judah Ibn

 Sighmar (cf. above, p. 158), cooperating in Qayrawiin and Old Cairo. Judah
 himself in Egypt and his two brothers in. Tunisia had business relations, but
 no partnership, as is proved by their correspondence.
11 Maimonides, Responsa, I, 150, 155: the two queries probably refer to the

 same case (one and three cousins respectively who continued the actual part-
 nerships of their fathers, sharing work, domicile, and food).

 Dr. A. L. Udovitch drew my attention to A. Dietrich, Arabi.sche Briefe aus

(Hamburg, 1955), p. 107, where a commission of 4.85 percent is assumed. But
 the text does not warrant that a commission is intended.
 6 See sources cited p. 435, n. 71. The word ju'l is also used for payments to

 a governmental authority, e.g., an imposition on a city in wartime (TS 16.286v,
 I. 4* [Alexandria, Oct., 1219]), or for a tax in connection with rubbish disposal
(TS Box K 6, f. 44v, 1. 11 [O1d Cairo, 1247]; the laborer doing the work re-
 ceives wages not included in the tax), or the word is used for fees paid in
 connection with a lawsuit before a Muslim court (TS 28.6, sec. A, I. 4 [1079]}.
 In the first and last cases, the plural aj'iil is used. Both the expression ju'l
al-diliila (TS 13 J 3, f. 7, I. 13) and the circumstances in which ju'l occurs in
 connection with sales, force us to assume that the term means brokerage. The
phrase ju'l wa-samiil.J,a has the same meaning as diliila wa-samiil.J,a, or samsara
wa-samiil.J,a (see J>. 449, n. 25).

C. THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MERCHANTS
 AND HIS WAREHOUSE
 1 The Hebrew expression is a literal translation of the Arabic. Paqid in

this connection does not mean "official," as in modern Hebrew, but "repre-







 sentative, agent." The Karaites substituted paqid for shiili'a~ (literally: mes-
 senger), which is the rabbinical word for agent. It is possible that the first
 Jewish "representatives of merchants" were Karaites, which would explain
 the term. The Rabbanites, too, used paqid in the sense of agent, though not
 as commonly as the Karaites. Tombstone: G. Gnoli, Le Iscrizioni Giudeo-
 Persiane del Gur (Afghanistan) (Rome, 1964), p. 23. The last but one word
 in I. 1 is: ha-yiishiir.

 "they invested some capital in the presence of the ~adi," as translated in that
 volume, but "they entrusted some goods to the qadi for selling them."

111 Standard silk: ~arir. Superior quality: khazz, e.g., at a time when 10
 pounds of ~arir cost 22-30 dinars, khazz was worth 50 (TS 13 J 27, f. 4,
 11. 27-30). TS 13 J 19, f. 27, I. s•: 1 pound of khazz cost 3.25 dinars "and
 would have been higher had not the Syro-Palestinian silk arrived." Inferior
 quality: khazash or khashaz or khazzaj, e.g., when khazz cost 36-39 dinars,
 khazash cost 10 (TS 10 J 10 f. 23, l. 12, India Book 251; ULC Or 1080 J 258,
 l. 12). Qazz, black and red, perhaps used more in Palestine and Egypt.
 Lasin, coming mainly from Sicily, but also from Iraq, was inferior, and cost
 1 dinar per pound when standard silk was as high as 2-% dinars (ULC Or
 1080 J 119). Ibrisim came from Khorii.san via Aleppo, but also from Ahwaz
 in southwest Iran (TS 13 J 25, f. 18, I. 12). Indian red silk, lanas or lenas. a
 major item in the India trade, was strangely all but absent from the Medi-
 terranean (TS 12.147).
Iltiqtij Andalusi, Spanish "pickups": Bodi. MS Heb. b 3 (Cat. 2806), f. 19,
 l. ls+, which "could very well refer to what today we would call schappe silk,
 which is defined as silk yam which is produced by combing and spinning the







waste silk" (Miss Dorothy G. Shepherd in her kind communication to me,
dated Jan. 13, 1961).
 Zaytiini mujallii, "glossy zaytimi," in Qayrawan in 1048 cost about 1 dinar
per pound. The letter (TS 20.69v, I. 20) says that 2,000 Egyptian dirhem
weights of this fabric cost 15 dinars. Since an Egyptian pound comprised 140
dirhems, the quantity was about 14.3 pounds. The term is derived from
Zaytiin, or Chuanchow, in China (cf. Dozy, Supplement, I, 617a). It does not
occur in the Geniza documents dealing with the India trade, and in TS 13 J 8,
f. 13, sec. B, 1. 2, Nahray 170, 700 pounds of zaytiini seem to come from the
West.
 For the terms manqiuj, maqshur, and qatiirish see above, page 104, where
the countries of origin are also surveyed. See also n. 60, below.
 54 TS 12.367, I. 16: "good Sicilian silk" sold at 1 pound
for 2 dinars or less
in the 1030's; TS 8 J 18, f. 27, margin, and verso, I. 1, Nahray 119: the price
was "2-2.125 dinars" in the 1060's. Second source in n. 55: in 1151, 10
pounds were estimated at 20 dinars in Old Cairo, while in July, 1150, 5
pounds cost 10.5 dinars in Sunhat, Lower Egypt (TS Box 8, f. 66*).
 55 ULC Or 1080 J 22 (ca. 1040)* and Bodi. MS Heb. a 3 (Cat. 2873), f. 5,

11. 17-18 (dated 1151)*. The letter TS 13 J 35, f. 15, assumes that one could
make a livelihood in Alexandria with an investment of 18 dinars.
 66 E.g., Hayyim b. 'Ammar Madini (i.e., of Palermo), who left over a hun-

dred pounds of silk in Mazara, Sicily, for transportation to Egypt and bought
another forty-five on his return to Palermo (TS 20.122, ll. 22, 29 [ca. 1050]).
Another wholesaler in silk was the Persian Isaac Nisabiiri of Alexandria (ca.
1100), cf. p. 153, above, and, a generation later, Abu NW;1r b. Abraham of the
same city. See also below, nn. 58, 59.

t.he Maghrebi pound, see Hinz, Masse, p. 32.
 59 TS 20.69v, II. 26--27: 5 pounds silk cost 7.5 dinars and 1-½ pounds cost

90 dirhems (i.e., I pound cost 67.5 dirhems), exchange rate of dinar: dirhem ==
1:45. Sicilian silk: ibid., 1. 6 (quantity: 168 pounds and 2 ounces).
 00 TS 12.251, I. 18 (ca. 1030). The silk is called Jizi, derived
from fiz,
chrysalis (cf. Dozy, Supplement, I, 234a), which obviously designates a top
variety extracted from the best part of the silkworm cocoon (cf. above p. 153).
Bodi. MS Heb. c 28 (Cat. 2876), f. 61, II. 28---29•: 4 pounds for 51-½ quarter

 61 Varieties of Egyptian flax (if not otherwise indicated, the names are

derived from well-known localities):
 Aqfii~, for Aqfahs (written thus, Ibn Duqmaq, V, 3, or Aqfabl}, Yaqiit,
I, 338) in the Bahnasii province: TS Box 25, f. 19v, I. 2•.







Ashmuni: TS 13 J 29, f. 2, I. 10. Purchase of flax in al-Ashmfmayn: TS
 12.2v, I. 11.
Asyii.t: TS 16.13v, I. 21; TS Box J 1, f. 1, col. III, I. 5, and elsewhere.
Atfil].i or Tfil].i (with t instead oft): TS 20.127; TS 16.7v, I. 12. A flax order
 from Atfil]: TS 12.215v, II. 5, 12*.
Bahnasa: TS 12.248, 1. 15 and top. Cf. also above, "s.v. Aqfii§." Wana' in
this province (cf. Ibn Duqmaq, V, 15), must also have been an important flax
center, as a. merchant is warned not to buy there (TS 12.372v, I. 10).
Barrani: TS 12.366, I. 13 ("the most popular cloth in Sicily"). TS 12.372v,
I. 10 (an order to buy this type). From TS K 15, f. 53, II. 2-3, where bamini
 ("outside") is opposed to juwwiini ("inside") it appears that this is a technical
term and not a name derived from a locality.
Bush: ENA 154 (2558) (many caravans go there from Alexandria to buy
flax). TS 12.372v, I. 10 (request not to buy there). The place is in the
neighborhood of other ancient centers of flax-growing, being situated south
of Atfil] and east of Fayyum. The taxes from Bush, Wana', and Maydii.m
were farmed out together (Firkovitch II, 1700, f. 13 [1156]).
 Bu~ir: The flax produced there was the most popular with the Genim
merchants. There are countless references. The many references to Bt1~ir (a
name derived from that of the god Osiris), must certainly be to Bft§ir Quridis
at the entrance of the Fayyum. Goods are sent from there to the Mediter-
ranean ports via Cairo and letters are forwarded from Alexandria to Bu~ir
via Cairo.
Dallii.l}, also written Dini (i.e., Dalle§): Common, but TS 12.372v, I. 10,
contains a warning not to buy there.
Fayyiim: Second in importance only to Bii~ir. TS 20.127, I. 63 ("When
you are in Alexandria, buy me good [tayyib] Fayyumi"). Bodi. Heb. a 2 (Cat.
2805), f. 20, II. 21-22* ("If you find good [§a.Iii]] Fayyumi, the hairy one and
'the stroke with the knife' [shu'ur wa-q~' al-sikkin] ...").
 Fisha and Fishiyya flax: Bodi. Heb. d 65 (Cat. 2877), f. 17, II. 32-33. Ilm
Duqmii.q, V, lists three localities bearing this name. See below, s.v. "Sanbuti."
 Kiimil: Gottheil-Worrell, XXII, p. 98, I. 16; TS 8 J 19, f. 32, top, Nahray 59.
TS 20.127v, l. 4 (not to be had in al-Mahdiyya), called here kiimili. The term
("complete") obviously has a techniral meaning. It cannot be derived from
the name Kii.mil, which was not used at that time.
Laythi: See below, n. 80.
 Malal (spelled miiliil in TS 20.76v. I. 6): Very common. The orig.in of this
designation is unknown to me.
 Misii.ri, from Misiira, a locality in Upper EgyJ)t, not far from other flax-
producing places such as al-Ashmimayn and Asyut: Frequent, written also
Jf's'ry, i.e., Mesari, Bodi. MS. Heb. c 27 (Cat. 2876), f. 82, l. 19, and verso,
1.1.
 Qasis or Qissis ("Christian minister"): TS 20.127, I. 11, 51 ff., a variety of
high quality.
 Qimat, ("bandage," "swaddle"): Common.
 ~anbiiti: To·be had in the neighborhood of Fisha, cf. above, s.v. A locali~y
Sambutiyya (withs. not~) (cf. Ibn Duqmaq, V, 91), is repeatedly mentioned
in the Geniza and distinguished there from Sunbat, the well-known town.
 Sawi, from Saw, a locality in the district of al-Ashmimayn: Mentioned to-
gether with Barrii.ni as very popular in Sicily (cf. above, s.v. "Barrii.ni").







Tamawi: TS 16.163, I. rn•. Tama is a locality in the Asyut district (lbn
 Du'qmaq, V, 24).
Tansii.wi: Gottheil-Worrell, XXII, p. 98, 1. 16, where tansawi is to be read
 for fransiiwi. I had assumed that this variety was named for a great Muslim
 flax merchant and shipowner bearing the name who was frequently mentioned
 in the Geniza letters. But we read also: "I bought flax in Tansii." (Ibn Duqmii.q,
 V, 9): TS 13 J 27, f.18, 1. 3. •

67 TS Box J 1, f. 54.
68 The manuscript reads 290, which is certainly a mistake of the clerk who

 copied the letter, for all quotations are given, as usual, in descending order.
 The Hebrew numerals for 70 and 90 are similar.

 IL 25-26; TS 12.513, a fragment that might have been addressed to Ibn
 'Awkal, notes the price of 6-¾ dinars per qintar in Tunisia (1. 29).
70 The number ttw, 415, refers to the Muslim year that began March 15,

 1024. It should not be taken as an abbreviation of (dt)ttw, i.e., 4815, year of

 the other quotations given by Habib Zayat, op. cit. (see n. 1), p. 333, show
 that in Iraq, too, the khitiyya was used as a riverboat. The pronunciation
 khayfiyya (Fahmy, Muslim Sea-power, p. 159) cannot be maintained, as in

tatis (Paris, 1678), s.v. "kombarion" and "cumba." The word might indeed
be Semitic. The Phoenicians possessed a type of boat called kumba (rendered
as kymbe in Greek).
 12 Traveling in a ghurii.b: TS 16.13v, 11. 7-11. TS 12.386v, 11. 7-8, Nahra1J







143: "Sheikh Abii 'Abdallah b. al-Ba'ba' arrived in Alexandria (from
Tunisia) in a ghurab and I do not know whether he is fleeing to save his life or
is an ordinary traveler." Sending a shipment with the captain of a ghuriib: TS
13 J 25, I. 19, I. 16+. Eugene E. Byrne, Genoese Shipping in the Twelfth and
Thirteenth Centuries (Cambridge, Mass., 1930), p. 6, remarks that galleys
were less costly than sailing ships. This refers, however, to the construction
costs as compared with those of the large sailing ships in use by the Genocse
after the period considered here, not to the cost of operation.
Arabic writers sometimes made puns on the word ghurii.b, taking it as
"raven" (cf. Habib Zayat, Al-Machriq, 43 [1949], 354): "The black 'raven'
with the white sail makes yellow the [faces of the] blue[-cyed, i.e., European]
enemy" (Ibn Mammiiti, Qawcinin al-Dawii.win, p. 340, quoted by Zayat, p.
347, I. I). This does not prove, however, that the word designating the type of
galley called ghuriib originally had that meaning.
It seems there is no connec~ion between ghuriib and the English corvette,
which is derived from Latin corbis (basket), but, like ghuriib, was mistaken as
a diminutive of corvus {crow, raven).
13 The barge making the journey from Alexandria to Almeria, Spain, in 65

days-in 1130 approximately (p. 325, above)-is called shakhtiir; the plural
 shakhii.tir (with t and short i) occurs around 1050, designating passenger boats
 arriving in al-Mahdiyya: Bodl. MS Heb. a 3 (Cat. 2873), f. 13, I. 49*. The
 word is in use up to the present day for a coastal craft.
Another common type was the khinzira, attested for Sicily, Tunisia, Tripoli,
 and Egypt. A Tunisian khinzira once is mentioned as sailing on the Nile. The
 word means "hub, or nave of a wheel," a rather strange designation for a ship.
 With this, however, the nickname of a ship, duwwiima ("whipping-top"), might
 be compared: TS 8 J 21, f. 29, 1. 5; TS 13 J 20, f. 19v, IL 1-2, Nahray 174;
 TS Box 28, f. 228, IL 4 and 17♦, and elsewhere. (Khinzir-without a-means
 "pig" and was used in Syria also as the name of a fish.)
Hajm, normally designating a large drinking bowl, was the name for a type
 of ship on the route between Sicily and Egypt, a name appropriate for a ship
 with a round hull: TS 12.372, I. 20. Another type, used on the same route,
 was called qarriiba, meaning box, chest (cf. Dozy, Supplement, II, 323a). Per-
 haps it was similar to the East Roman dromon, which was "a blunt ship with
 angular rather than smoothly flowing lines" ( cf. Lionel Casson, The Ancient
 Mariners [New York, 1959], p. 243, and the photograph of the model made
 by R.H. Dolley of the British Museum, ibid., opposite p. 219).
In addition to ghurab, the war galley was also called shini, a synonym ac-
 cording to Ibn Mammiiti (cf. preceding note). In the Geniza shini is reserved
 for warships; WJhii.b al-shawii.ni means "pirates" or raiders. Bodi. MS Heb. b 11

For the Spanish Hebrew poets referred to, cf. H. Schirmann, Hebrew Poetry
 in Spain and Provence (Jerusalem, 1954), I, 82 (Samuel ha-Nagid, d. 1056),

 sidriyya, as here.

 6 The total payment in sih-er was 31.75 dirhems, which had a value of

 22.50 qi rats of gold (see I. 25 of the document). Since a dinar contained 24
 qiriits, the exchange rate of dinar:dirhem must have been I :36.3.

 9 "Guards," ma{iiiris (cf. Dozy, Supplement, I, 270b).
10 The whole freight, including the main part, which was paid after arrival,

 was called "advance," sulfa (cf. Dozy, Supplement, I, 675a).
11 This tip is invariably called "bribe," barfil. in Arabic or shob,ad in Hebrew.

 Perhaps it was originally given to secure a good place for the consignments
 accompanying the traveler. In Bodi. MS Heb. d 65 (Cat. 2877), f. 17v, 1. 1,
 a tip of 1 dinar was given for a consignment of textiles and mercury, the freight
 of which cost 18 dinars. In TS 16.264, I. 4, the tip for a shipment of lead was
 2 dinars and its freight 16. In one case, we read that a traveler presented a
 skipper with two baskets of ~alwa, or sweetmeat, which he had set apart for

 letters st as Hebrew numerals and dated the letter .A.H. 460 (A.D. 1067). A
 mere glance at the handwriting shows, however, that it must be later than
 1500. In fact, the manuscript has st with a sign of abbreviation; Arabic
 sitt(in), sixty, is intended, referring most probably to the Muslim year (9)60,
 which began on Dec. 18, 1552. It was common to leave out the hundreds in

rate of exchange between gold and silver in the account from al-Mahdiyya
was 1 : 33-½, as against 1 : 36-½ in the account from Alexandria. In the latter,
the bale remained in storage for two nights, while in the former nothing is
 stated about the duration of the traveler's stay. The sum of 1 dirhem paid
 for lodging in al-Mahdiyya would also tally with that paid in Alexandria, if
 we assumed it was for two nights.

 was pronounced also at such times as after a grave illness, the man must have
 recited, in addition, verses such as Psalms 107 :'.?3-32, which showed that he

 APPENDIX D: The Exchange Rate of Gold and Silver Money
1 Following R. Brunschvig, Ha/sides, II, 74, Idris, Zirides, p. 641, states:
"Les monnaies d'or et d'argent etaient legalement independantes l'une de







l'autre." This is literally true. However, as the material presented here proves,
during most of the Fatimid period, the value of silver was indicated by its
relation to the standard gold dinar and not vice versa. The situation was
different in Ayyubid and Mamluk times (see p. 384, above).
2 Andrew S. Ebrenkreutz, "Studies in the
Monetary History of the Near
East in the Middle Ages," Part II, JESHO, 6 (1963), 243-277; ibid., p. 244
n. 1, where further studies by the same author on the subject are indicated;
Balog, "History of the Dirhem." For a recent discussion of the problem of
fineness see Paul Balog, The Coina,ge of the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt and
Syria (New York: American Numismatic Society, 1964), p. 39 n.1; George C.
Miles, "Islamic Numismatics: A Progress Report," Congresso lnternazionale
di Numismatica (Rome, 1961), pp. 181-192.
3 Ibn Muyassar, Annales d'Egypte, p. 2,
J. 4, reports that the murder
occurred on Sunday, 3 Jumada I, 439 A.H. According to Wiistenfeld-Mahler,
Vergleichungs-tabellen, ed. B. Spuler (1961), p. 10, the 3rd was a Monday.
This discrepancy, however, should not induce us to doubt the accuracy of
lbn Muyassar's statement (see p. 356, above). About Abu Ntt§r, Abu Sa'd's
brother, see Fischel, Jews, p. 87.
• Thus, and not 'l-sft. Hardly identical with Hashim b. Ja'far (Idris,
Zirides, pp. 109-110).
5 This term has not yet been found elsewhere. Its exact
meaning remains
therefore uncertain.
6 While the general purport of the paragraph
is evident, I am not sure
about the translation of the words in parentheses.
7 Precaution: isti1hiir (cf. Dozy, Supplement, II,
 87). It is found in the
same sense in a Hebrew letter by Sa'adya Gaon, dated 921-922, ed.
S. Schechter in JQR, 14 (1901-1902), 61, where the editor took it however as a
place-name. Cf. also TS 10 J 9, f. 3, I. 7: tuba' 'ala 1l-talab wa-sti1hiir, "it
should be sold only when demanded and with precaution."
8 In Arabic: thamanhii. 'ala dinar wa-nusf (cf. Dozy,
Supplement, 11, 106,
where the examples quoted are to be translated "approximately," as here).
9 Seep. 81, above.
 10 Since shiimi oil is involved, perhaps the Palestinian
ratl is meant, which
was about six times as heavy as the Egyptian. A quantity of about 2.5 kilogram
of oil would correspond better to about 36.5 kilogram of wheat than a mere
437.5 gram.
 11 Add: D. H. Baneth in Tarbiz, 30 (1961), 171-172.
 12 The Andalusian signed in monumental script, although
he wrote the
document in his cursive hand, which is, however, identifiable through other
manuscripts, where he uses the cursive also for his signature.
 13 This account differs slightly from the one given in JQR,
51 (1960), 3S-
39. At the time of the writing of that article I had at my disposal only my
notes, not a transcript of the original.
 14 Because of the omission of the tens, the court
 record is erroneously dated
1501 (of the Era of the Documents, which would correspond to A.D. 1190).
It is made out however, "under the authority of Abraham Nagid" (the eon
of Moses Maimonides), who assumed that title in 1213 and bore it until his
death in 1237. Thus, our document must have been written either in 1220
or in 1230. Since the mutaqaHi'a were taken out of circulation in 1225, and
the other documents quoted here also precede al-Kiimil's reform, the date of
1220 is more likely or perhaps the only possible.







15 JNUL 2•. TS 12.515•: a court record from Fustat from pre-Fatimid

 times, dated 967, speaks of 600 pieces of silver called niqiir, of pearl-like
 appearance. With the exception of the term niqar the text is in Hebrew.
 (The word bedolaJ.,, was translated at that time with Arabic lu'lu' [cf. Jami'
 al-a/,fa1, ed. Solomon L. Skoss (New Haven, 1936), I, 196], which reflects the
 Hebrew usage of the tenth century.)

 writer mentions, however, his coming through al-Fuwwa, a place where the
 Nile branches off into a canal leading to Alexandria, the writer must have
 been at that time in Egypt.

"Goitein's achievement definitely ranks him with ... a handful of other masters in the
 limited circle of truly immortal historical scholarship."
 Howard Sachar, The American Scholar

 One of the best comprehensive histories of a culture in this century."
Amos Funkenstein, Stanford University

 [A] stupendous labor oflove .... Such scholarship as his is, in Lord Acton's phrase, 'not a
 burden on the memory but an illumination of the soul."'
George Kirk, Muslim World

 A significant contribution to our knowledge of the private and communal life of medieval
 Near Eastern Jews as well as of Christians and Muslims with whom they lived in the closest
 proximity."
 Frank Rosenthal, American Historical Review

 The work, though based on primary research and likely to influence the whole field for
 decades ... is always readable and at times entertaining."
The Times (London)

 Goitein's perceptive study not only lights up the economic, social, and religious life of the
 Jews in the Islamic World, but also illuminates the Christian and Islamic communities,
 giving us new insights and broader horizons. The work is remarkable for its sheer magni-
 tude, but more particularly for the humane sensibility and imagination, the skill, and the
 formidable learning that it reflects."
 The Haskins Medal Committee

 This is a most :eadable book. ... A new vista of research has opened for the student
 of history of Mediterranean countries during the Middle Ages.... An outstanding
 accomplishment."
Harry Poppers, American Historical Review

 A truly remarkable achievement.... When we consider that [previously] consulting Geniza
 materials was possible only for the learned few, we may measure the debt we all owe Goitein .
 . , . Given the exceptional importance of the Geniza and the unusual difficulties posed by its
 contents, we understand how much we have been given."
 Jacob Newsner, journ,tl ofthe Academy ofReligion

S.D. GOITEIN (1900-1985), scholar, administrator, professor, and author of 500 or more
 ooks and articles in Hebrew and English, worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton until his death.

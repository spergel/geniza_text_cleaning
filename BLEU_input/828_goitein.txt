This is to inform the honorable elders that the bearer of this letter

is a prominent personality from Ê¾Arqa who suffered great calamities and

many misfortunes. His children and wife were taken captive and he lost everything he possessed, remaining "naked

and bare." "I went away full, and God has brought me back empty." He learned that his children

and wife were alive. He searched after them from one place to another, but found

only one boy and the wife, while the others had been murdered. The captives are under

the hand of a man who stood security for them until they would be ransomed. This man

was a benefactor to people, and now he travels seeking the mercy of God

and the compassion of "the munificent from the people of the God of Abraham." They do all the time

works of charity with him and deeds of lovingkindness. May God reward them.

"For He is a God of recompense," He will requite. And "almsgiving saves

from death," etc.

Your slave woman, the wife // widow //,

destitute and debt-ridden 

with four orphans 

In the name of "Him who looks after the poor and broken-spirited" (Isaiah 66:2). I have made God the ex(alted) my intercessor with your excellencies, my masters, the illustrious lordly judges, and with the elders of Israel, may their Rock [bless them] with the best of blessings, so that [you kindly bestow] upon me something to conceal myself and the fo[ur] who are with me, and with which I can satisfy my hunger and theirs. We are five souls, desolate, naked, and starving, having no one to turn to except God the ex(alted) and my masters the illustrious elders, 

"who sow by all waters" (Isaiah 32:20), who act with kindness toward all. I and my children never, ever uncover our faces, not to a group of people or to individuals. However, necessity has now forced us to do this. May you look upon us with a merciful eye and obtain reward because of us. May you not neglect us. After this petition the only thing left is life through your kindness or death as a result of your neglect, far be it from you. May God the ex(alted) accept from us our pious prayers for you. May your welfare increase for ever.

In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent peace and greetings be upon

until the day of judgment. The slave kisses the ground before
the noble and exalted prophetic presence, may God double its light and raise aloft
forever its beacon, and reports the continued arrival of the Rūm merchants, who have arrived
with timber, and whose coming the slave had reported. They are Sergius
the son of Constantine, .... the son of ... , Grasso the son of Leo the Amalfitan,
... and Bon Senyon the Genoese, and their companions who are with them.
They say that up to the time of the slave's writing this report, the
[ ] of the timber that they brought has not been established and no .... has reached them.

I am writing this letter- -may God prolong the life of my lord, the 

Sheikh and. make permanent his honoured position, his- success and happiness 

being in good health, may God unite us 

in the best of circumstances. What I have tell you 

about the news of the war. is that an Andalusian 

ship set sail from al-Mahdiyya, the enemy 

fought it, but the night separated them and it 

returned safely to Sfax. Then, when 

a second ship set sail, the enemy rammed it 

and took everything which was in it, merchandise and 

people, and left the ship turned upside down. 

Eleven men returned... 

About this . . . 

The Maghribis (were very angry), that the enemy was able to carry away 

even their cargo... 

This is what I have to announce you. Please let me know 

the price of khazƒÅsh (a kind of silk).
